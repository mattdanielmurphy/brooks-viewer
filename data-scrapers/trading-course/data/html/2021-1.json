new all-time high. That increases the chance of a gap up next week on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. However, if there is a strong rally in early January, it will probably soon lead to a profit-taking pullback down to 3500.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>on the weekly chart are at the apex of a 10-month triangle. There should be a breakout in January. There is a 50% chance that it will be up and a 50% chance it will be down.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex has rallied strongly since March, but there is a nested wedge top. That often leads to profit taking. This week’s bear outside down bar might be the start of a pullback to the November low at around 1.16.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-on-weekly-chart-are-at-the-apex-of-a-triangle-with-equal-chance-of-a-bull-or-bear-breakout\">Bond futures on<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart are at the apex of a triangle, with equal chance of a bull or bear breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-at-apex-of-triangle-with-possible-failed-ii-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-2.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart at apex of triangle with possible failed ii bear breakout\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures had a high this week that was below last week’s high, and a low that was above last week’s low. This week therefore was an inside bar on the weekly chart. That is a Breakout Mode pattern, which means it is both a buy and sell signal bar for last week.<p>It is important to note that last week broke below an ii Breakout Mode pattern (consecutive inside bars). If the coming week goes above the top of the ii, which is the high from 3 week’s ago, last week’s ii sell signal will have failed. Additionally, that ii is still a Breakout Mode pattern. If this week goes above it, not only does it end the sell signal, but it triggers a buy signal.<p>The weekly bond chart is at the apex of a 10-month triangle, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. It is also in a 4-week tight trading range that is within a 9-week tight trading range. Those are also Breakout Mode patterns.<p>While the bond market has been trading down in a tight bear channel for 5 months, it has been going sideways for 2 months at the bottom of the 10-month triangle (trading range). Traders should assume that the chance of a bull breakout is the same as for a bear breakout.<h3 id=\"3-deceptive-math-for-breakout-traders\">Deceptive math for breakout traders</h3><p>Traders expect a 4-point measured move up or down, based on the height of the 2-month trading range. With the bonds hovering in the middle of the range, a bull could buy and risk about 2 points to just below the bottom of the range. He could hold for 2 points to the top, and then 4 more points for a measured move up. It appears he is risking 2 points to make 6 points on a 50-50 bet.<p>The opposite is true for a bear. He can risk 2 points to above the range, trying to make 6 points.<p>Since it is Breakout Mode, isn’t the probability 50%? If so, that is a great trade for both the bulls and the bears. If either takes it 10 times, he loses 10 points (5 losses out of 10 trades for 2 points each) and makes 30 points (5 wins of 6 points). Why not either buy or sell in the middle of the range?<h3 id=\"4-what-did-i-not-say-about-breakout-mode\">What did I not say about Breakout Mode?</h3><p>The answer is that you did not read my words carefully enough. Traders believe that a Breakout Mode pattern has about a 50% chance of reaching approximately a measured move up or down, which is true. However, there is one other point that I always make, but I did not make yet. That point changes the math.<p>Here it is… there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail. Therefore, if a bull buys, there is a 50% chance he will get stopped out only to have the market continue in the range, or resume back up without him. If a bear sells, he has a 50% chance of being stopped out on a failed bull breakout, and then watching the market either continue sideways, or break to the downside. There are often two or more failed breakouts before one succeeds (reaches a measured move target).<p>Therefore, traders do not believe it is as simple as taking a bet with 1:3 risk/reward and 50% probability. It could not be that way for both the bulls and bears, and therefore it is not that way for either. That would be close to a perfect trade. No one would take the other side, and, consequently, the trade cannot exist.<h3 id=\"5-breakout-mode-means-traders-want-more-information\">Breakout Mode means traders want more information</h3><p>Once there is a consensus about direction, the market races in that direction. Why isn’t the bond market crashing after selling off since the March high? Because traders believe it is neutral. The math is about the same for the bulls and bears.<p>Everyone expects a breakout soon, but experienced traders know there is a 50% chance that the breakout will reverse. Those traders will watch the breakout. If it looks strong, they will trade in that direction. If it looks like it might reverse, they will be prepared to enter in the opposite direction.<h2 id=\"6-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"7-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-in-bull-trend-but-might-be-starting-minor-reversal-down-from-nested-wedge-top\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart is in bull trend, but might be starting minor reversal down from nested wedge top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-nested-wedge-top-buy-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-2-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart in nested wedge top buy climax.png\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart formed an outside down bar this week, and it had a bear body. However, it closed above last week’s low and far above the low of the week. Consequently, it is less bearish than it could have been. However, since there is a nested wedge top, which I will discuss below, the EURUSD has probably begun a pullback. Traders should expect it to trade sideways to down for several weeks.<p>The EURUSD rallied strongly from the November 4 low. That rally is the 3rd leg up from the March low. Once a bull channel has 3 legs up, traders start to look to take profits. It does not matter that the rally does not have a textbook wedge shape. Three pushes up in a bull channel behaves like a wedge, and traders think of it as a wedge variation.<p>I said that the 2-month rally was the 3rd leg up in a wedge bull channel. If you look closely, the rally also had 3 pushes up. It is therefore a small wedge. When a 2-month wedge is the 3rd leg up of a bigger wedge, there is a nested wedge. That is more climactic, and it has a higher probability of leading to a reversal. This week is a good candidate for the start of a reversal down.<p>However, if next week is a bull bar closing on its high, it would be a buy signal bar. Traders would expect a little more sideways to up trading before the test down to the November 4 low.<h3 id=\"8-the-1st-reversal-down-will-probably-be-minor\">The 1st reversal down will probably be minor</h3><p>A reversal does not mean a bear trend. That would be a major trend reversal. When a tight bull channel reverses, the reversal is typically minor. That means it has becomes a bull flag or a trading range.<p>When there is a reversal after a buy climax, traders want to see at least a couple legs down. They want to be sure that the reversal will not become major (a bear trend) before buying again. They like to see the bears try at least twice and fail. At that point, the bulls will look for a buy setup.<p>Two clear legs typically require about 10 bars, and often more. Therefore, the odds favor at least a month or two of sideways to down trading, and it might have begun this week. If the bears get a 3rd consecutive bear bar next week, especially if it closes near its low, traders will conclude that the pullback is underway.<p>In addition to looking for a couple legs down, traders expect a test of support. The most common support is the start of the final leg up. Traders want to seek if the bulls will buy again at that price. That is the November 4 low at around 1.16.<h3 id=\"9-expect-a-test-of-125-but-not-in-january\">Expect a test of 1.25, but not in January</h3><p>Can the bull channel continue up to the next resistance before the bulls take profits? Of course. A strong bull trend often goes much further than what appears likely.<p>The next resistance is the top of the bull channel that was created by the March 9 and September 1 highs. That is currently around 1.24.<p>A more important target is the February 2018 high, just above 1.25. This rally should get there this year, but it will probably pull back first.<h2 id=\"10-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"11-yearly-emini-chart-has-big-outside-up-bar\"><em>Yearly</em>Emini Chart has big outside up bar</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SP500-cash-index-year-candlestick-chart-has-huge-outside-up-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-2-2.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 cash index year candlestick chart has huge outside up bar\"></a></figure><p>The yearly S&amp;P500 Emini futures candlestick chart (each bar is one year) has a big outside up bar for 2020. I showed the cash index chart above because the Emini only goes back 24 years, but the two charts are almost identical since Emini began in 1997. This year closed on its high at a new all-time high, and far above last year’s high. This is a sign of very eager bulls, and it makes at least slightly higher prices likely in 2021.<p>The bulls hope that it is the start of a new, stronger leg up. But when an especially strong bull bar comes late in a bull trend, it often attracts profit takers within a couple bars (years). Therefore, it has an increased chance of being an exhaustive buy climax. That typically leads to about 10 bars and 2 legs of sideways to down trading. Consequently, while this is an extremely strong bull trend, it probably is getting too strong. It will probably lead to a decade-long trading range beginning within a year or two.<p>There was about a 10-year trading range after the 1965 buy climax, and again after the 2000 buy climax. Each had at least a couple pullbacks of 40 to 70%.<p>On the yearly chart, a 10-year sideways to down move of 50% is still just a pullback, because the stock market will continue to be in a bull trend on the yearly chart for at least another century. There is no sign of a top, and the Emini should go at least a little higher. However, this rally will probably lead to a prolonged trading range beginning within a couple years, like after 1965 and 2000.<h3 id=\"12-possible-gap-up-on-yearly-chart\">Possible gap up on yearly chart</h3><p>I have said many times over the past several weeks that the bulls would try to get the year to close on its high, and then create a gap up in 2021. The year closed on its high. There is a 50% chance of a gap up on Monday when 2021 begins.<p>If there is a gap up, it will be small on the yearly chart. A small gap is usually insignificant and it typically closes before the bar closes. But the yearly bar that starts on Monday closes a year from now. The Emini could rally a lot on the daily chart before closing the gap on the yearly chart.<p>What about the other 50%? Yes, a 50% chance of a gap up, but 50% chance of not a gap up. It is common to see an inside bar after a big outside bar. Therefore, rather than gapping up and creating a possible low of the year, the Emini could open below the 2020 high and create an early high of the year. There is a 20% chance of this happening.<p>If the Emini opens below this year’s high on Monday, it will probably break above the 2020 high within a couple weeks. Traders would expect it early next week.<h2 id=\"13-monthly-emini-chart-has-follow-through-buying-after-november-strong-breakout\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has follow-through buying after November strong breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-monthly-futures-candlestick-chart-has-good-follow-through-buying-after-November-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-2-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly futures candlestick chart has good follow-through buying after November breakout. Emini closed 2020 on high.\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart in December formed a bull bar closing near its high after a big bull breakout bar in November. This is strong follow-through buying, and it increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices in January.<p>As I have been saying for several weeks, the bulls want a gap up in January. That gap to a new all-time high would be present on the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly charts. While I have not checked, I suspect this has never happened in the history of the stock market. It would be a sign of aggressive buying.<p>If there is a gap up, the bulls will want it to stay open. However, the gap will probably be small on the monthly and yearly charts. Small gaps tend to be insignificant. Most close before the bar closes or shortly afterwards. That means a gap up on the monthly chart would likely close in January or February. If gap closes on the monthly chart, it will close on the yearly chart.<p>There is no sign of a top and this rally could continue much higher. Just look at 1995 to see how far a bull breakout can last.<p>However, there are some problems that could result in a pullback starting in January. A pullback does not mean a bear trend. For example, there was a 1-month pullback in September, and the bull trend resumed up in October. If January begins to pull back, traders will expect 1- 3 months of sideways to down trading.<p>The bears would need several strong down months before traders would wonder if a bear trend was beginning. That is currently unlikely.<h2 id=\"14-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-in-small-pullback-bull-trend-but-possible-micro-wedge-and-minor-reversal-down-soon\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart in Small Pullback Bull Trend, but possible micro wedge and minor reversal down soon</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-weekly-futures-candlestick-chart-in-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-2-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly futures candlestick chart in small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied in a bull channel since the March low. It is now in the middle of the channel. Can the rally reach the top of the channel without a pullback to the October 12 high?<p>While it is possible, it is more likely that there will be a 2- to 3-week pullback beginning in January. The 1st support is that October 12 high, which is the neck line of the September/October double bottom bull flag. Markets often come back to test the breakout point before continuing up to the measured move target. That target is 3876.<p>With this week closing on its high, traders expect at least slightly higher prices for a week or two. But it is important to notice that about half of the bars for 4 months have had bear bodies. This means that the bears keep coming back, and that increases the chance of a pullback beginning in January.<p>What happens if the bulls keep getting bull bars closing on their highs? It would increase the chance that the rally will reach the top of the bull channel by some time in February. Bull trends can go a long way before pulling back, and there is no sign of even a minor top yet.<h2 id=\"15-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-in-small-pullback-bull-trend-but-late-in-bull-channel\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart in Small Pullback Bull Trend, but Late in Bull Channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-daily-futures-candlestick-chart-in-bull-channel-in-Spike-and-channel-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-2-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily futures candlestick chart in bull channel in Spike and channel bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a strong rally in early November (a spike up), and then entered a bull channel with the pullback on November 10. This is a Spike and Channel Bull Trend.<p>The Emini has had several thrusts up in the channel, and it is now at the top of the bull channel. Traders should think of a bull channel as a bear flag. This is because there is a 75% chance of a break below the channel, and only a 25% chance of a<em>successful</em>breakout above the channel.<p>By successful, I mean restarting the market cycle. Instead of the channel evolving into a trading range, there would be a new breakout. That breakout would eventually have a pullback and then transition into a bull channel. After that, traders would again look for a break below the bottom of the channel (the bull trend line), and an evolution into a trading range.<h3 id=\"16-will-the-breakout-above-the-bull-channel-fail\">Will the breakout above the bull channel fail?</h3><p>The bulls began a small breakout above the bull channel this week. If the breakout is going to fail, it typically does so by around the 5th bar. There is often a very strong rally for several days before the bulls take profits and the buy climax reverses.<p>Traders will continue to buy until they see the reversal. Once it begins, the profit taking should last for a couple legs and about 10 bars.<p>Also, it should reach support. The most common target is the start of the bull channel. That is the November 10 low. Traders will wonder if the bulls will buy again there, like they did in November.<p>There is another reason for the Emini to test that level. It is also at the October 10 high, which is the neck line of the September/October double bottom that I mentioned in the section on the weekly chart. Finally, that is around the 3500 Big Round Number, which is a psychological magnet.<p>So, traders should expect higher prices and possibly a very strong rally above the bull channel for about a week. Then, look for a possible reversal down to below the channel on the daily chart. This is more likely than a continuation up to the top of the channel on the weekly chart.<h2 id=\"17-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

More importantly, the Emini closed at a new all-time high. The bulls hope for an Emini gap up above Thursday’s high today, which it probably will. That would form a gap up to a new high on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts, which might not have ever happened before in the history of the stock market. It would increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices this week.<p>However, the daily chart is in the channel phase of a Spike and Channel Bull Trend. Traders should expect a test down to the start of the channel by the end of January. That is around 3500. It is important to note that there is no top yet and the bull trend is strong. Traders will continue to bet on higher prices until there is a clear reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 14 points in the Globex session.

It reversed down for 2 days last week after a small wedge top.<p>However, today so far is a big bull day after a big bear day, and today’s open is near the top of Friday’s bear body. This is a special type of bear trap, and it usually leads to higher prices if the bull bar closes near its high. It would be even better for the bulls if today can close 20 or more pips above last week’s high.<p>If it does not, the bears still might get a double top with last week’s high and a reversal down. Today would then be a bull trap after Friday’s bear trap.<p>There is a measured move target at 1.2409, which is based on the height of the August through November trading range. A more important target is the February 2018 high of 1.2555 (not shown). There is a 50% chance that this rally will get there without more than a 5-day pullback.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market opened near Friday’s open, which is the top of Friday’s bear body on the daily chart. It then rallied in a Small Pullback bull trend overnight. Traders have only been buying.<p>The EURUSD is now back again at the top of its 3-week trading range. Because of the bear trap on the daily chart, traders expect higher prices this week. But if the bulls cannot break above the 3-week trading range, traders will then expect another leg down in the range.<p>The overnight rally was a Trending Trading Range type of bull trend. There was an early tight trading range, a breakout, and then a 2nd trading range. The height of the trading ranges is small. Therefore, day traders have only been buying.<p>But because the range is so small, day traders have had a difficult time making even only 10 pips over the past 4 hours. They will continue to only look to buy until the bears can create at least a 20-pip leg down. They will also sell if there is a breakout above the range that reverses down, or a 30-pip bear breakout below the range.<p>The bulls will be satisfied if today closes around where it is now. There would then be a strong bear trap on the daily chart. The bears want to weaken this buy signal by creating a conspicuous tail on top of today’s candlestick. They will need the day to close at least 20 pips down from the high.<p>Can today reverse down? Since the EURUSD is at the top of a 3-week trading range, a reversal down can come at any time. But the bear trap makes it more likely that the EURUSD will close near the high of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-outside-down-bear-trend-and-midday-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down bear trend and midday reversal up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from today.

In fact, it traded below Thursday’s low and last week’s low. Thursday was outside up and today was outside down. This week is also now an outside down week. There was a midday reversal up and the day closed just below the middle.<p>Consecutive outside days is an OO (outside-outside), which is a Breakout Mode pattern. Today is both a buy and sell signal bar on the daily charts. With it being a big bear day and with the Emini being late in a bull channel on the daily chart, it is more likely that the sell signal will trigger this week. But the big tail on the bottom of day’s candlestick creates uncertainty. That increases the chance of the Emini going sideways tomorrow. If the bears get more bear bars, traders will look for a test of the start of the bull channel, which is the November 10 low around 3500.<p>What happens if tomorrow is a bull inside bar? It would be a buy signal for an IOI pattern. The OO pattern will still be in effect, with sellers below today’s low and buyers above today’s high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

In fact, this week is already an outside down week. Since Thursday was an outside up day, there are consecutive outside bars on the daily chart. This is an OO (outside-outside) setup, which is a Breakout mode pattern. Yesterday is both a buy and sell signal bar. If the Emini trades below yesterday’s low within the next few days, it would trigger the sell signal. However, yesterday had a big tail below. That creates uncertainty and increases the chance that today will be sideways.<p>Since there is a Spike and Channel Bull Trend on the daily chart, traders expect a test of the start of the bear channel. That is the November 10 low just below 3500. Yesterday might have been the start of a move down to 3500. The bears need a break below yesterday’s low to trigger the sell signal. They also need bear bars closing near their lows.<p>If the OO buy signal triggers this week, it would be coming late in a bull trend. The OO would probably be a Final Bull Flag, which means the rally would likely not go far before the Emini reversed down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 12 points in the Globex session. While the selling was strong yesterday, the Emini actually rallied for the entire 2nd half of the day, and it was basically in a trading range for 5 hours. Today is going to open within that range.<p>I have been saying for several weeks that the Emini might wait for the results of the Georgia senate races before making its next move. Those results might not be available until the end of the week.<p>Yesterday’s exhaustive sell climax led to a trading range. There is an increased chance of the Emini continuing yesterday’s trading range and staying within yesterday’s range today. Also, the big tail on the bottom of yesterday’s candlestick on the daily chart means that there might be buyers below yesterday’s low. That is true even though a break below yesterday’s low would trigger a sell signal on the daily chart.<p>Today will open around yesterday’s close and within yesterday’s trading range. Also, the Emini is in the middle of a 6-week trading range. Finally, there is uncertainty regarding the Georgia election. These factors increase the chance of more trading range trading. However, with yesterday’s range as big as it was, there will probably be swing trades up and down today, even if it is a trading range day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-outside-down-bear-trend-and-midday-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-5.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down bear trend and midday reversal up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-micro-double-top-with-wedge-top-in-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-5-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex micro double top with wedge top in bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been in a strong bull trend and there is room to a measured move target above. Also, the February 2018 high above 1.25 is another magnet.<p>However, the Small Pullback Bull Trend from the November 4 low has lasted about 50 bars, which is a long time. Traders are wondering if there will be a deeper pullback before the rally continues up to 1.25.<p>There was a wedge top last week and then a big 2-day selloff to the start of the wedge. The EURUSD is now testing the top of the wedge. The bears want a 2nd reversal down from a small double top. However, the bulls hope that the 2-day selloff was just a test of support, and that the bull trend is resuming.<p>With the EURUSD in a trading range between 1.20 and 1.23, it is in Breakout Mode. Traders believe there is a 50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout.<p>Once there is a successful breakout, they will look for a 300-pip measured move. For the bulls, that would be far above their 1.25 target. For the bears, a 300-pip selloff would be a test of the bottom of the August/October trading range.<p>I have been saying that Forex markets often make big moves in early January. That may happen here. But until there is a breakout, traders will bet on reversals. They are buying low, selling high, and taking profits every few days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied a little early in the overnight session, but has been in a 30-pip trading range since then. Day traders are scalping. Today so far is a small inside day, which is neutral. I have been saying that financial markets might be waiting for the results of the Georgia senate races. Those results might not come until the end of the week.<p>While a breakout can come at any time, markets have inertia. They tend to continue to do what they have been doing. Day traders will continue to scalp until there is a breakout.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-5-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

One way is to have the week close above last week’s low. The Emini then formed a higher trading range. Today was a Bull Trending Trading Range Day.<p>Today was a bull inside day after yesterday was a 2nd consecutive outside day (OO, outside-outside, Breakout Mode). It is therefore an ioi bull flag buy signal bar. However, the OO is more important.<p>Also, the Emini is back in last week’s trading range. That increases the chance that it will go more sideways ahead of the Georgia election results.

It is therefore an ioi buy signal bar for today (inside-outside-inside).<p>But, remember, Thursday and Monday were consecutive outside bars. That is an OO Breakout Mode pattern (outside-outside), which is a more important setup. Monday is therefore both a buy signal bar, and a sell signal bar.<p>Also, there is a Spike and Channel Bull Trend on the daily chart. Traders should expect a break below the bottom of the channel at some point in January, and then a test down to the start of the channel. That is the November 10 low at around 3500. Monday may be the start of a couple weeks down to 3500. We need to see follow-through selling over the next few days.<p>With both buy and sell signals, there is confusion. That typically results in some sideways trading. Traders might be waiting for the results of the Georgia elections, which will probably come by the end of the week.<p>It is important to understand that sometimes when a market triggers a higher time frame buy signal, it immediately reverses down sharply. That happened this week on the yearly, monthly, and weekly charts. However, when that happens, the market often resumes up and triggers the signal again before deciding if the signal will fail or succeed.<p>This might be happening with the Emini. Traders should know that there is a 50% chance that the Emini will go back above last year’s high, before there is a 2nd leg down. The odds still favor a move down to 3500 before the Emini goes much above last year’s high, if it does go above last year’s high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 11 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was an inside day. Today will open in the middle of yesterday’s range. Markets sometimes form consecutive inside days. Traders will therefore watch for reversals today on tests of yesterday’s high and low.<p>With the Emini in the middle of a 2-week trading range and with reversals every couple days, there is an increased chance of more trading range trading today. However, because it will probably begin to test down to 3500 this month, there is an increased chance of some bear trend days, like Monday.<p>That also increases the chance of bears being squeezed, which can lead to a series of strong bull trend days. Most likely, the Emini will have another quiet day. But, traders should be ready for several bear trend days coming at any time.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day and OO breakout mode\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It sold off sharply for 2 days last week, but reversed back up to a new high. This is a reminder that a bull channel can quickly become a bear trend at any time. However, the selloff turned out to be a breakout test of the September 1, and it became a bear trap.<p>It is important to note that trends constantly try to reverse, but most reversal attempts fail. Markets have inertia. That means they resist change and they tend to continue to do what they have been doing.<p>The next targets for the bulls are a measured move projection just above 1.24 and, more importantly, the February 2018 major lower high, just above 1.25.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market formed a trading range early in the session, rallied to a new high, and then has been sideways again for several hours. This is a Bull Trending Trading Range Day. While it is a bull trend, it is a weak bull trend because most of the trading is within trading ranges. Day traders are willing to sell for scalps, but because it is a bull trend, it is still easier to make money as a bull. There is a 25% chance that there will be a reversal down. More likely, it will stay sideways or go a little higher.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-buy-climax-and-midday-reversal-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-6-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It also made a new all-time high. However, after a truncated wedge bull channel and triangle top, the Emini quickly sold off 50%. It closed just above the midpoint and above yesterday’s high, which is good for the bulls. But the big tail on top and the failure at the top of the 6-day tight range increase the chance of a reversal down beginning soon.<p>Remember, I said that Monday triggered a buy signal on the yearly chart by going above last year’s high. Last year was an outside up bar. I also said that when a higher time frame signal triggers, there is often an immediate reversal down, like on Monday. Finally, I mentioned that the Emini will rally back to trigger the buy signal a second time within a week or two. That happened today.<p>Today also triggered the OO buy signal on the daily chart. Traders will now decide if this is a double top with Monday’s high or the start of a new leg up. The 2nd leg up in a double top is often a buy climax, like the Emini had today. Traders expect a test of 3500. However, the Emini could rally a little more before the reversal down begins<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This often happens with higher time frame signals. When a buy signal bar is big, many bulls do not want to risk to below the bottom of the buy signal bar. Therefore, there is a relative lack of buyers above the buy signal bar, and the chart often quickly reverses down after triggering the buy signal. However, the bulls who did not buy often buy a sharp selloff, like they did yesterday.<p>Half of the time, the Emini rallies again and triggers the signal a 2nd time, which it did yesterday. Yesterday also triggered the OO (outside-outside) buy signal on the daily chart. But an OO late in a bull trend frequently becomes the Final Bull Flag. There is an increased chance of a reversal down within about 5 days.<p>Yesterday’s Emini climactic test rally was extremely strong, but there was a late reversal down. The bears are hoping that yesterday formed a double top with Monday’s high. It is important to note that the 2nd leg up in a double top is sometimes an extreme buy climax, like yesterday. However, the selloff was weak and it is more likely a bull flag.<p>As I have been discussing over the past month, there are issues with the daily, weekly, and monthly charts that make a pullback to 3500 likely to begin this month. Therefore, the Emini will probably not go much higher before pulling back. It sometimes will go sideways for many days at a key price, before breaking out in either direction. That might happen here.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. The bulls hope that yesterday’s late selloff was just a bull flag.<p>Today will gap above the top of yesterday’s bear channel. The bulls want the rally to resume and for the Emini to close at the high of the week tomorrow.<p>At the moment, it is going sideways around the high and close of last year, and the open of the week.<p>This might continue through the end of the week. Because yesterday’s reversal up was so strong, there is an increased chance of trend resumption up today. However, because the Emini might be stuck at those magnets, it is slightly more likely that the week will end around here when it closes tomorrow.<p>So far the week is a big outside doji bar on the weekly chart. That is neutral and it increases the chance of the sideways trading continuing through tomorrow. However, the swings up and down have been big. Day traders will expect at least one leg up and one leg down again to day, like over the past several days.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-buy-climax-and-midday-reversal-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-7.png\" alt=\"Emini climactic test of last year's high and buy climax.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-weak-bull-channel-and-possible-bull-leg-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-7-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weak bull channel and possible bull leg in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been in a bull trend since November 4. Today reversed down after 3 bull days. Most reversal attempts in bull trends fail, and become pullbacks (bull flags), and therefore that is what is likely here.<p>However, when a bull trend begins to have lots of big bear bears, the odds are that the channel will soon have a bear breakout. Most bull channels have a break below the bull trend line and then the bull trend converts into a trading range. That is likely here. However, most attempts to end a bull trend fail.<p>Today is the 5th attempt since December 4. Traders should expect the bull channel to be followed by a 2-week swing down soon. However, until there is a clear top or a sustained reversal down, traders will keep buying 2- to 3- selloffs, knowing that most reversal attempts fail.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down strongly overnight from near yesterday’s high, to below yesterday’s low. But yesterday was the 3rd consecutive bull day in a bull channel. There probably will be buyers around yesterday’s low. Therefore, even though day traders have only been selling overnight, the bears might soon begin to take profits, fearful that the bulls will buy around yesterday’s low.<p>The EURUSD has bounced 30-pips over the past 2 hours. Traders know that the 1st leg up after a strong selloff is minor. It typically becomes a bear flag or a leg in a developing trading range. However, it is enough buying for bull traders to look to buy a reversal up from a test down to the low.<p>Can this 1st leg up continue to reverse the selloff, become a bull trend, and create a V-bottom? That happens 30% of the time. It is more likely that there will be test down and an evolution into a trading range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-Bull-trend-From-The-Open-and-breakout-above-3800-Big-Round-Number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Bull trend From The Open and breakout above 3800 Big Round Number\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, it is a minor target since most computers will not see it.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.

While it is overbought, traders will keep buying until there is a clear top, or a strong reversal down. There is a measured move target above at 3807.50, based on a measuring gap on the 60 minute chart. That is a magnet above and today should get there.<p>Today is Friday and the end of a reasonably strong 1st week in 2021. Weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. This week is an Emini outside up week. Therefore this week’s open and last week’s high are important. The bulls want today to close above both, and they want the week to close on the high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>For the bears, last year’s high and close are magnets below, as is the 3800 Big Round Number. Both are near the open of this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 16 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open around the measured move target of 3807.50 on the 60 minute chart. That might lead to some profit-taking today, especially after 3 strong bull days. Also, the Emini is breaking above the top of the bull channel that began with the November 9 high. That is another resistance level. But until there is a clear top, traders will be more interested in buying.<p>Yesterday spent most of the day in a trading range. A trading range late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. Consequently, if there is an early rally today, there could be a reversal down. Day traders will look for a sell setup for a swing down.<p>Can today be a strong bull trend day? After a 3-day rally, that is unlikely. If today is a bull trend day, it will probably be a weaker bull trend, like a Trending Trading Range Day. Also, if there is a rally, there is an increased chance of a midday reversal down.<p>What about a big bear trend day? With the Emini overbought and at the resistance of the measured move target, and the top of the daily channel, the bears could get a bear trend day today. If today starts to reverse, day traders will look for tests of the magnets below. The most important are the open of the week and last week’s high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-Bull-trend-From-The-Open-and-breakout-above-3800-Big-Round-Number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-8.png\" alt=\"Emini Bull trend From The Open and breakout above 3800 Big Round Number.

Last week’s sharp 2-day selloff was a sign that it has also been in a trading range since early December. Traders are deciding if the rally will continue up to the measured move target at 1.2409 and then 1.25 at the February 2018 high, or sell off for several weeks first.<p>The longer the EURUSD stalls, the higher the probability that it will fall below last week’s low before reaching 1.25. The bulls have stopped buying aggressively. If they become disappointed, they will take profits. That would lead to a swing down.<p>The past 2 days have reversed down. But they came after 3 bull days, and the 2 bear days are not particularly strong. They are more likely a pullback from the 3-day rally, than the start of a 3-week selloff.<p>However, with the EURUSD reversing every few days in a tight trading range for several weeks, there is no sense of urgency. Traders think that the price is about right. They have been buying selloffs and selling rallies, betting on reversals.<p>Everyone is waiting for a strong breakout up or down. There is no sign that one is about to begin. But Forex markets often reverse at the start of a year. That increases the chance of a swing down starting soon.<p>Also, the rally from the November low is a bull channel. Since most bull channels have bear breakouts, there should be a bear breakout at some point. It probably will come before the EURUSD reaches 1.25.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market fell below yesterday’s low, but then reversed up. In fact, there have been several reversals overnight. Day traders have been scalping for 10 to 20 pips.<p>What is left for the day is the decision about how the day and week will close. The bulls want bull bodies on the candlesticks on the daily and weekly charts. They will buy near the low of the week and the low of the session. So far, they are not buying relentlessly enough to create a bull trend.<p>The bears want bear bodies on both the daily and weekly charts. They have a better chance on the daily chart, but after reversing up twice overnight from below yesterday’s low, today has probably put in the low. The bulls have a better chance of a swing up, than the bears have of a swing down. If today has a bull body on the daily chart, today will be a good High 1 buy signal bar.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-8-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear breakout below triangle and then bull trend reversal\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After a 3 hour trading range, there was a sharp selloff to the 60-minute EMA and then a strong reversal up. The day and week closed on the high.

But it is breaking above bull channels on the daily and monthly charts, and any breakout above bull channel typically fails by about 5 bars.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market is breaking below a 9-month triangle and a bull trend line. If there is follow-through selling next week, traders will expect a measured move down.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is stalling at the top of a 6-year trading range.

While I have been saying that the bond market will be lower 5 and 10 years from now, it had been neutral for 9 months. Not any more. The odds favor lower prices.<p>But what happens next week will affect those odds. Next week is the follow-through bar. At a minimum, the bears want at least a small bear body. That would further increase the chance of lower prices over the following several weeks. Traders will begin to look for a 12-point measured move down to around 158 based on the height of the 9-month trading range. That is just above the January 2, 2020 low, which is the bottom of last year’s 3-month buy climax. It is therefore an important magnet. The bigger the bear follow-through bar and the more it closes on its low, the stronger the bear trend. That means bonds would probably fall lower and faster.<p>If next week reverses up and closes on its high, like it did after the June 5 bear breakout, traders will conclude that the breakout has failed. They will expect higher prices over the next few weeks, and possibly a break above the bear trend line and a test of the August high. With this week’s close, the bulls currently have a 25% chance of that happening over the next few months.<p>What if next week is a small bull or bear bar that closes in the middle? That would be disappointing for the bears, but they would still be in control. Traders would then look for either follow-through selling, or a reversal up on the following week, to give a clue about the direction for the next couple months. At the moment, traders expect lower prices.<h2 id=\"3-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"4-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-a-wedge-rally-to-top-of-6-year-trading-range\">EURUSD<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart has a wedge rally to top of 6-year trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-is-wedge-rally-to-top-of-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-9-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD monthly chart has rallied since March. However, as strong as the rally has been on the weekly and daily charts, the rally on the monthly chart is still just a bull leg in a 6-year trading range. The bulls need a couple closes far above the February 2018 high, before traders will conclude that the monthly chart has converted to a bull trend. If it does, and it probably will either this year or next, traders will conclude that the bull trend that ended in July 2008 is resuming.<p>If the bulls get their strong breakout, traders will look for a measured move up based on the height of the 6-year range. That would be above the May 2014 high.<p>But it is important to understand that most attempts to break out of a trading range fail. Consequently, it is more likely that the EURUSD will reverse down for a least a couple months, before breaking strongly above the February 2018 high. If it does, it will be from a wedge rally to a double top. That is a reliable topping pattern. It could lead to a couple legs down. On the monthly chart, that could last several months.<p>Can the EURUSD break below the 2017 low? That is the neck line of the double top. If it did, traders will look for a measured move down to the October 2000 low. It is more likely that a reversal down will just prolong the trading range. It has gone on for 6 years. Traders should not be surprised if it continued for another couple years.<p>The bear channel from the July 2008 high is probably a bull flag. The selloff has held above the October 2000 bottom of the bull trend. The EURUSD has broken above the 12-year bear channel this year. That converted the bear channel into a trading range.<p>If the bulls can continue the rally, the trading range will convert into a bull trend. But as I said, there will probably be a pullback for several months beginning soon. However, because of the break above the 12-year bear channel, the odds favor a breakout above the February 2018 high at some point this year.<h2 id=\"5-eurusd-daily-chart-has-a-weak-rally-which-might-be-the-start-of-a-trading-range\">EURUSD<strong><em>daily</em></strong>chart has a weak rally, which might be the start of a trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-has-weak-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-9-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart has weak Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD daily chart has been in a bull trend since March. However, the rally from the December 9 low has been weak. Furthermore, the big 2-day selloff on December 31 and January 1 created confusion.<p>Yes, the EURUSD made a new 20-month high this week. But it has been unable to break strongly above 1.23, despite 5 attempts since mid-December.<p>Also, as I mentioned above, the EURUSD is near the top of a 6-year trading range. There is a 50% chance that the EURUSD will test down again to 1.20 at the bottom of the month-long trading range before continuing up to 1.25. Consecutive bull bars closing above this week’s high would shift the probability in favor of a test of 1.25 within a month.<h2 id=\"6-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"7-the-emini-on-monthly-chart-is-breaking-above-bull-channel\">The Emini on<strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>chart is breaking above bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SP500-Emini-futures-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-11-year-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-9-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini futures candlestick chart breakout above bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke to a new all-time high this week. This month’s candlestick is currently a bull bar. It is the 3rd consecutive bull bar after the October High 1 bull flag. But since September and October were both bear bars coming late in the strong reversal up from the pandemic low, the buy setup was weaker. A rally from a weak bull flag in a buy climax usually stalls after a couple bars. January is the 3rd bar. That increases the chance of a pullback in January.<p>Can the rally continue up for 10 consecutive bull bars? Why not? Look back at the S&amp;P in 1995 (not shown). The market tripled in the next 5 years. But that kind of acceleration up happens only 25% of a time. Each bull bar that gets added increases the chance of higher prices. Also, it makes traders more eager to buy a pullback.<p>The bulls will continue to buy as long as the chart keeps creating strong bull bars. Furthermore, the rally from the March 2020 low has only had one pullback and it lasted only one bar (September). That is very strong. Traders will therefore buy any 1- to 3- bar (month) pullback in 2021. They might get their chance in January or February.<h2 id=\"8-the-emini-on-weekly-chart-is-in-a-small-pullback-bull-trend\">The Emini on<strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SP500-Emini-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-small-pullback-bull-trend-near-measured-move-target.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-9-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini futures weekly candlestick chart in small pullback bull trend near measured move target\"></a></figure><p>The S&amp;P500 Emini futures on the weekly chart has been in a strong bull trend since March. This week was an outside bar. The Emini traded below last week’s low and then above last week’s high. It also closed on its high and at an all-time high. Additionally, this is the 4th consecutive week closing near the high of the bar.<p>The rally from the October low is accelerating, and next week might gap up. It does not matter that the rally is extreme and that an extreme rally increases the chance of a strong reversal down. A buy climax can go much higher and last much longer than what you might think is reasonable. Until there is a credible top or a strong reversal down, traders will continue to expect higher prices.<h2 id=\"9-the-emini-on-daily-chart-is-breaking-above-bull-channel-but-the-breakout-will-probably-fail\">The Emini on<strong><em>Daily</em></strong>chart is breaking above bull channel, but the breakout will probably fail</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SP500-Emini-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-9-5.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini futures daily candlestick chart breakout above bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart rallied strongly after Monday’s big selloff. It is breaking above the top of the bull channel that began on November 9.<p>While that is a sign of strong bulls, traders must understand that only 25% of breakouts above bull channels result in a stronger bull trend. Instead, there is a 75% chance of a reversal down within about 5 bars. Therefore, as strong as the bull trend has been, traders should be ready for a possible reversal down next week.<p>If there is a reversal down, how far will it go? The first target is the bottom of the bull channel, which is the bull trend line. Because the bull channel is tight, that is only a small correction down to around 3700. If there is a blow-off top and a reversal down, it will probably last a few weeks and drop lower than what traders might expect.<p>For example, a reversal down from a bull channel often reaches the start of the channel. That is the November 10 low at around 3500. But as long as the bull trend continues to form bull bars closing near their highs, traders will buy. However, if there is a reversal down, it could be fast, like after the September 2 blow-off top. The market fell 10% over the next 3 weeks.<h2 id=\"10-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There is a 75% chance that the breakout will reverse down within about 5 bars. But with Friday and last week closing on the highs, the buy climax might continue higher early this week as buy climax is accelerating. Remember, a buy climax can go much further than what might seem reasonable. Traders will continue to buy until there is a top or a big reversal down.<p>However, I have been saying that there is an increased chance of a reversal down after January 6. With the Emini trying to break above its bull channel, that further increases the chance of a reversal down starting this week. If the bears can create two or three consecutive bear days, or one huge bear day that closes on its low, traders will expect a couple legs down over the next 2 weeks. The 1st target is the November 10 low, which was the start of the bull channel.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 32 points in the Globex session. Because Friday was a strong buy climax, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour today. There is only a 25% chance of a strong bull trend today.<p>Also, several factors increase the chance of a series of bear days beginning this week. The Emini is in a buy climax on the daily chart. It is breaking above the top of a bull channel on the daily and monthly charts. It is in a window when a reversal down is increasingly likely. And bull trends often end with an extremely strong rally on the 5-minute chart, like we had on Friday.<p>Does today have to be a big bear trend day? Not at all. In fact, a trading range is always the most likely thing every day. But because there is an increased chance of a reversal down on the daily chart starting this week, day traders should be ready for an increased chance of bear trends on the 5-minute chart this week.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bear-breakout-below-triangle-and-then-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-11.png\" alt=\"Emini bear breakout below triangle and then bull trend reversal.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-reversing-down-from-buy-climax-at-top-of-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-11-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex reversing down from buy climax at top of trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has 3 consecutive big bear bars closing on their lows. This is coming after a strong rally since the November 4 low, and a trading range since December 4.<p>I have been saying that there would be an increased chance of a reversal down for several weeks beginning in early January. If today closes on its low, there will be an increased chance of 2 or 3 legs down.<p>The first target is the bottom of the trading range at the December 9 low. If the bears get a couple closes below that, traders will wonder if the selloff will continue down to the November 4 low.<p>What could change the outlook? If today closes in the middle or top of its range, or if tomorrow is a strong bull bar, the bulls will have a chance of resuming the 3-month bull trend. But if today closes in the bottom third of its range, traders will expect a test down to at least the December 9 low. Also, they will expect at least a couple legs down, and for the selloff to last 2 to 3 weeks at a minimum.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been trading down for 3 days in a bear channel. While this is good for the bears, bear channels usually do not last more than 3 days. Traders should expect a transition today.<p>There is a 25% chance of a collapse and an acceleration down into a much stronger bear trend. More likely, the EURUSD will start to go sideways. If the bulls can stop the selling for a day or two, they will then try to reverse the selloff.<p>However, because of the wedge top at resistance on the weekly chart, traders will sell the 1st bounce on the daily chart. The odds currently favor lower prices.<p>But the bear channel on the 5-minute chart will attract buyers today or tomorrow for a 1- to 2-day bounce. Day traders know this and will look for reversals up from the low for scalps up. They will continue to look to sell rallies unless the bulls can create a very strong reversal up on the daily chart and resume the bull trend. The odds favor lower prices in the EURUSD Forex market for a few weeks.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-inside-day-and-midday-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini inside day and midday reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then sold off from a wedge rally exactly at the middle of the day (bar 41) for a midday reversal. It did not break above yesterday’s high so today was an inside day.<p>Today had a bull body and it is a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart for tomorrow. But the day was a doji bar and that is a weak buy signal.<p>Today was also the 5th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart, which is becoming extreme. A bull streak increases the chance of a bear day tomorrow or soon.<p>Additionally, this is the 3rd day above the bull channel on the daily chart. A bull breakout above a buy channel typically fails by around the 5th bar. That increases the chance of s 2-week reversal down beginning this week.<p>But it is important to remember that trends can last a long time.

There is a 75% chance that the breakout will reverse down within about 5 bars. But with Friday and last week closing on the highs, the buy climax might continue higher early this week as buy climax is accelerating. Remember, a buy climax can go much further than what might seem reasonable. Traders will continue to buy until there is a top or a big reversal down.<p>However, I have been saying that there is an increased chance of a reversal down after January 6. With the Emini trying to break above its bull channel, that further increases the chance of a reversal down starting this week. If the bears can create two or three consecutive bear days, or one huge bear day that closes on its low, traders will expect a couple legs down over the next 2 weeks. The 1st target is the November 10 low, which was the start of the bull channel.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 32 points in the Globex session. Because Friday was a strong buy climax, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour today. There is only a 25% chance of a strong bull trend today.<p>Also, several factors increase the chance of a series of bear days beginning this week. The Emini is in a buy climax on the daily chart. It is breaking above the top of a bull channel on the daily and monthly charts. It is in a window when a reversal down is increasingly likely. And bull trends often end with an extremely strong rally on the 5-minute chart, like we had on Friday.<p>Does today have to be a big bear trend day? Not at all. In fact, a trading range is always the most likely thing every day. But because there is an increased chance of a reversal down on the daily chart starting this week, day traders should be ready for an increased chance of bear trends on the 5-minute chart this week.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bear-breakout-below-triangle-and-then-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-11.png\" alt=\"Emini bear breakout below triangle and then bull trend reversal.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-reversing-down-from-buy-climax-at-top-of-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-11-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex reversing down from buy climax at top of trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has 3 consecutive big bear bars closing on their lows. This is coming after a strong rally since the November 4 low, and a trading range since December 4.<p>I have been saying that there would be an increased chance of a reversal down for several weeks beginning in early January. If today closes on its low, there will be an increased chance of 2 or 3 legs down.<p>The first target is the bottom of the trading range at the December 9 low. If the bears get a couple closes below that, traders will wonder if the selloff will continue down to the November 4 low.<p>What could change the outlook? If today closes in the middle or top of its range, or if tomorrow is a strong bull bar, the bulls will have a chance of resuming the 3-month bull trend. But if today closes in the bottom third of its range, traders will expect a test down to at least the December 9 low. Also, they will expect at least a couple legs down, and for the selloff to last 2 to 3 weeks at a minimum.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been trading down for 3 days in a bear channel. While this is good for the bears, bear channels usually do not last more than 3 days. Traders should expect a transition today.<p>There is a 25% chance of a collapse and an acceleration down into a much stronger bear trend. More likely, the EURUSD will start to go sideways. If the bulls can stop the selling for a day or two, they will then try to reverse the selloff.<p>However, because of the wedge top at resistance on the weekly chart, traders will sell the 1st bounce on the daily chart. The odds currently favor lower prices.<p>But the bear channel on the 5-minute chart will attract buyers today or tomorrow for a 1- to 2-day bounce. Day traders know this and will look for reversals up from the low for scalps up. They will continue to look to sell rallies unless the bulls can create a very strong reversal up on the daily chart and resume the bull trend. The odds favor lower prices in the EURUSD Forex market for a few weeks.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-inside-day-and-midday-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini inside day and midday reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then sold off from a wedge rally exactly at the middle of the day (bar 41) for a midday reversal. It did not break above yesterday’s high so today was an inside day.<p>Today had a bull body and it is a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart for tomorrow. But the day was a doji bar and that is a weak buy signal.<p>Today was also the 5th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart, which is becoming extreme. A bull streak increases the chance of a bear day tomorrow or soon.<p>Additionally, this is the 3rd day above the bull channel on the daily chart. A bull breakout above a buy channel typically fails by around the 5th bar. That increases the chance of s 2-week reversal down beginning this week.<p>But it is important to remember that trends can last a long time. As long as the bulls keep getting bull bars, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Since that is extreme, it increases the chance of a bear day today or tomorrow. But unless there is a strong reversal down, the bulls will continue to buy pullbacks on the daily chart.<p>Yesterday’s high was below Friday’s high, and therefore yesterday was a pullback. Because it was a bull inside day, it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. However, the body was small, and a doji bar is a weak buy signal.<p>It is important to note that yesterday was the 3rd day above the bull channel on the daily chart. Most breakouts above bull channels fail within about 5 days. There is therefore an increased chance of a reversal down for a couple weeks beginning this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 5 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a trading range day, and today will open within yesterday’s range. That increases the chance of another trading range day today.<p>It is important to note what I mentioned above about 5 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart. That is becoming unusual, and the streak increases the chance of a bear day today. Therefore, if the Emini is above the open in the final hour, but within 20 points of it, traders should look for a possible quick move down to below the open.<p>Monday’s rally was extreme, and the bulls who bought the close of the day never had a chance to exit without a loss. When that happens, the bulls buy more lower, expecting a test of that high close. This would allow them to exit without a loss. But their escaping at that prior high often leads to a double top and then a reversal down.<p>Sometimes, their scaling in creates a bounce, but it does not reach the old high and they give up. That happened at the October 12 high. With the Emini being above the bull channel on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of a reversal down this week, and it could begin with after a test of Monday’s high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-inside-day-and-midday-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-12.png\" alt=\"Emini inside day and midday reversal. 5 consecutive bull bars on daily chart\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The selloff was strong enough so that traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to down. Therefore, they will sell the 1st 1- to 3-day rally.<p>The 1st target for the bears on the daily chart is the December 9 low, which was the start of the bull channel. If the selloff continues to be strong, traders will look for targets on the weekly chart where there is a wedge top. The 1st target on the weekly chart is the most recent higher low, which is the November 4 low.<p>There have been many strong reversals down, like this one, since the bull trend began in March. Each became a bull flag or a trading range. Traders expect that again here. What they are deciding is whether this one will be bigger. The wedge top on the weekly chart increases the chance that there will be a selloff that begins early this year and lasts a few months.<p>If the bulls get a big bull bar today, and strong follow-through buying over the next week, traders will expect a breakout above last week’s high. The bulls want the rally to reach the February 2018 high of 1.2555 before there is more than a 2-week pullback. That is unlikely, but if the bull trend resumes strongly within a couple weeks, the odds will shift back in favor of the bulls.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a trading range overnight. I said yesterday that the bear channel had lasted 3 days and that most channels on the 5-minute chart end by the end of the 3rd day. What typically happens is that the channel evolves into a trading range, and there is then a profit-taking reversal for a day or two. The EURUSD is attempting that process today.<p>Can the trading range become a bear flag and have a big bear breakout today? While that is possible, a trading range leading to a bounce tomorrow is more likely. So far, day traders have been looking for reversals and 10-pip scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-2nd-Leg-Trap-and-doji-trading-range-day-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini 2nd Leg Trap and doji trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up from a 2nd Leg Bear Trap that broke below the 60 minute EMA and the open of the week. But it was unable to get much above the 3800 Big Round Number and the open of the day. It closed just below the open to be the 1st bear day in 5 days.<p>There is now a 2-day pullback from Friday’s all-time high. Today is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.

Since that is extreme, it increases the chance of a bear day today or tomorrow. But unless there is a strong reversal down, the bulls will continue to buy pullbacks on the daily chart.<p>Yesterday’s high was below Friday’s high, and therefore yesterday was a pullback. Because it was a bull inside day, it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. However, the body was small, and a doji bar is a weak buy signal.<p>It is important to note that yesterday was the 3rd day above the bull channel on the daily chart. Most breakouts above bull channels fail within about 5 days. There is therefore an increased chance of a reversal down for a couple weeks beginning this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 5 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a trading range day, and today will open within yesterday’s range. That increases the chance of another trading range day today.<p>It is important to note what I mentioned above about 5 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart. That is becoming unusual, and the streak increases the chance of a bear day today. Therefore, if the Emini is above the open in the final hour, but within 20 points of it, traders should look for a possible quick move down to below the open.<p>Monday’s rally was extreme, and the bulls who bought the close of the day never had a chance to exit without a loss. When that happens, the bulls buy more lower, expecting a test of that high close. This would allow them to exit without a loss. But their escaping at that prior high often leads to a double top and then a reversal down.<p>Sometimes, their scaling in creates a bounce, but it does not reach the old high and they give up. That happened at the October 12 high. With the Emini being above the bull channel on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of a reversal down this week, and it could begin with after a test of Monday’s high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-inside-day-and-midday-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-12.png\" alt=\"Emini inside day and midday reversal. 5 consecutive bull bars on daily chart\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The selloff was strong enough so that traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to down. Therefore, they will sell the 1st 1- to 3-day rally.<p>The 1st target for the bears on the daily chart is the December 9 low, which was the start of the bull channel. If the selloff continues to be strong, traders will look for targets on the weekly chart where there is a wedge top. The 1st target on the weekly chart is the most recent higher low, which is the November 4 low.<p>There have been many strong reversals down, like this one, since the bull trend began in March. Each became a bull flag or a trading range. Traders expect that again here. What they are deciding is whether this one will be bigger. The wedge top on the weekly chart increases the chance that there will be a selloff that begins early this year and lasts a few months.<p>If the bulls get a big bull bar today, and strong follow-through buying over the next week, traders will expect a breakout above last week’s high. The bulls want the rally to reach the February 2018 high of 1.2555 before there is more than a 2-week pullback. That is unlikely, but if the bull trend resumes strongly within a couple weeks, the odds will shift back in favor of the bulls.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a trading range overnight. I said yesterday that the bear channel had lasted 3 days and that most channels on the 5-minute chart end by the end of the 3rd day. What typically happens is that the channel evolves into a trading range, and there is then a profit-taking reversal for a day or two. The EURUSD is attempting that process today.<p>Can the trading range become a bear flag and have a big bear breakout today? While that is possible, a trading range leading to a bounce tomorrow is more likely. So far, day traders have been looking for reversals and 10-pip scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-2nd-Leg-Trap-and-doji-trading-range-day-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini 2nd Leg Trap and doji trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It came after 5 consecutive bull bars. It is a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for a 2-day pullback from Friday’s all-time high. But a doji is a weak buy set-up. That means the probability of a big move above yesterday’s high is small. It makes it more likely that today will be a 4th consecutive sideways day.<p>The bull trend has lasted a long time on all time-frames. That increases the chance of a correction coming at any time. I have been saying that there was an increased risk after January 6. We are now in that window.<p>Even though there is an increased risk of a reversal down in January, Friday closed on its high. The bulls who bought that high have not been able to get out without a loss. If enough buy this 2-day pullback, the Emini will test that all-time high. Then, if many disappointed bulls who bought Friday decide to exit, their selling could create a small double top. But as long as the Emini continues in its bull trend, it is easier to make money buying.<p>I keep making the point that picking the exact top or bottom is a low probability trade. My 80% Rule says “80% of trend reversal attempts fail.” While the buy climaxes on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts increase the chance of a reversal, the odds still favor higher prices. However, the risk is greater over the next week or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 8 points in the Globex session. There has not been a bear day for 6 days. That is unusual and it therefore increases the chance of a close below the open today. The open could be a magnet in the final hour if the Emini is within 10 points of it.<p>The open of the week has been a magnet all week. It might be a magnet in the final hour on Friday when the weekly candlestick closes.<p>After 3 consecutive sideways days, day traders expect another trading range day. That means at least one swing up and one swing down, and either can come first. With the daily chart in a bull trend, traders expect the bull trend to resume. However, with an increased risk of a correction beginning over the next few weeks, traders are aware that a series of bear days can begin at any time.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-2nd-Leg-Trap-and-doji-trading-range-day-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-13.png\" alt=\"Emini 2nd Leg Trap and doji trading range day.

The bears hope that yesterday was just a pause in an early bear trend. But the bulls want a micro double bottom and a higher low. They want the 3-month bull trend to continue.<p>It is important to note that the daily chart has been sideways for 3 months. It is now in the middle of that trading range. A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. In general, traders assume that there is a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout.<p>The probabilities shift a little, depending on the recent bars. After 3 big bear bars, it is slightly more likely that the bears will win. But if there is a big bull bar tomorrow, the odds will then favor the bulls.<p>Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will continue to look for reversals every few days. Once there is a breakout, traders will look for at least a couple legs and a measured move, based on the 300-pip height of the range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high on today’s open, which triggered a buy signal for a higher low on the daily chart. But there were sellers above, and the EURUSD trended down on the 5-minute chart.<p>Remember, 2 days ago I said that there was a 3-day bear channel on the 5-minute chart, and that bear channels typically end by the 3rd day. Furthermore, I said that the bulls would get a 1- to 3- day bounce. Today’s open met the minimum expectation. The bears now hope that the 3-day bear trend is resuming.<p>But the EURUSD has now been sideways for 3 days. It might go sideways more before deciding on the direction of the next move.<p>The overnight selloff has been strong. Day traders have only been selling. However, with the EURUSD now in the middle of a 3-day trading range, the overnight bear trend will probably convert into a trading range soon.<p>Until there is a 30-pip bounce, day traders will only sell. But once there has been a 30-pip bounce, day traders will assume that the bear trend has evolved into a trading range. They will then be willing to buy as well as sell. If the EURUSD enters a trading range for an hour or more, the bulls will have a 30% chance of a reversal day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It came after 5 consecutive bull bars. It is a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for a 2-day pullback from Friday’s all-time high. But a doji is a weak buy set-up. That means the probability of a big move above yesterday’s high is small. It makes it more likely that today will be a 4th consecutive sideways day.<p>The bull trend has lasted a long time on all time-frames. That increases the chance of a correction coming at any time. I have been saying that there was an increased risk after January 6. We are now in that window.<p>Even though there is an increased risk of a reversal down in January, Friday closed on its high. The bulls who bought that high have not been able to get out without a loss. If enough buy this 2-day pullback, the Emini will test that all-time high. Then, if many disappointed bulls who bought Friday decide to exit, their selling could create a small double top. But as long as the Emini continues in its bull trend, it is easier to make money buying.<p>I keep making the point that picking the exact top or bottom is a low probability trade. My 80% Rule says “80% of trend reversal attempts fail.” While the buy climaxes on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts increase the chance of a reversal, the odds still favor higher prices. However, the risk is greater over the next week or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 8 points in the Globex session. There has not been a bear day for 6 days. That is unusual and it therefore increases the chance of a close below the open today. The open could be a magnet in the final hour if the Emini is within 10 points of it.<p>The open of the week has been a magnet all week. It might be a magnet in the final hour on Friday when the weekly candlestick closes.<p>After 3 consecutive sideways days, day traders expect another trading range day. That means at least one swing up and one swing down, and either can come first. With the daily chart in a bull trend, traders expect the bull trend to resume. However, with an increased risk of a correction beginning over the next few weeks, traders are aware that a series of bear days can begin at any time.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-2nd-Leg-Trap-and-doji-trading-range-day-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-13.png\" alt=\"Emini 2nd Leg Trap and doji trading range day.

The bears hope that yesterday was just a pause in an early bear trend. But the bulls want a micro double bottom and a higher low. They want the 3-month bull trend to continue.<p>It is important to note that the daily chart has been sideways for 3 months. It is now in the middle of that trading range. A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. In general, traders assume that there is a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout.<p>The probabilities shift a little, depending on the recent bars. After 3 big bear bars, it is slightly more likely that the bears will win. But if there is a big bull bar tomorrow, the odds will then favor the bulls.<p>Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will continue to look for reversals every few days. Once there is a breakout, traders will look for at least a couple legs and a measured move, based on the 300-pip height of the range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high on today’s open, which triggered a buy signal for a higher low on the daily chart. But there were sellers above, and the EURUSD trended down on the 5-minute chart.<p>Remember, 2 days ago I said that there was a 3-day bear channel on the 5-minute chart, and that bear channels typically end by the 3rd day. Furthermore, I said that the bulls would get a 1- to 3- day bounce. Today’s open met the minimum expectation. The bears now hope that the 3-day bear trend is resuming.<p>But the EURUSD has now been sideways for 3 days. It might go sideways more before deciding on the direction of the next move.<p>The overnight selloff has been strong. Day traders have only been selling. However, with the EURUSD now in the middle of a 3-day trading range, the overnight bear trend will probably convert into a trading range soon.<p>Until there is a 30-pip bounce, day traders will only sell. But once there has been a 30-pip bounce, day traders will assume that the bear trend has evolved into a trading range. They will then be willing to buy as well as sell. If the EURUSD enters a trading range for an hour or more, the bulls will have a 30% chance of a reversal day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But Tuesday was a doji bar and that is a weak buy signal bar. Yesterday barely closed above the buy signal bar high.<p>The bulls want the rally to test Friday’s high and close. That would allow those Buy The Close bulls from Friday to exit without a loss. If enough exit, it could create a double top and begin a correction down.<p>Unless the Emini breaks strongly above last week’s high, traders should still expect a reversal down to 3500 to begin this month. However, the bears need a good sell signal bar, or a surprisingly big reversal down before traders will conclude that the profit taking is underway. Until then, traders will continue to expect higher prices.<p>Yesterday was the 7th consecutive day without a bear body. That is unusual and therefore unsustainable. This streak is therefore a type of buy climax. It increases the chance of a bear day today. If today is within about 10 points of today’s open in the final hour, it could get drawn there by the end of the day.<p>What about impeachment, with the buy climax ignoring impeachment? The market already factored that in, and it does not care. But if there is unacceptable violence within the next couple weeks, it could be the catalyst for a pullback to 3500. In the meantime, traders continue to buy, knowing that a buy climax can go a long way before there is a reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open in the middle of its 5-day trading range. That increases the chance of more trading range trading today. However, today will probably have a bear body. Consequently, if there is a rally for several hours, traders will look for a midday reversal back down to below the open.<p>Suppose today sells off on the open. After 7 days without a bear body, day traders will look for a reversal back up to the open later in the day. However, since today will probably close below the open, if it is above the open late in the day, day traders will look for a reversal back down to the open.<p>What about a strong trend day up or down? That can happen at any time, but markets have inertia. That means they tend to continue to do what they’ve been doing. After going sideways for 5 days and opening in the middle of the range, it is more likely that today will be another mostly sideways day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel - with January buy climax ignoring impeachment\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is now near the bottom of the 2-month trading range. The bears want 2 closes below the January low. If they get that, they will look for a bear trend down to the November 4 low.<p>The bulls hope that this will be like every other strong selloff since March. They want it to form a higher low, and for the bull trend to resume, like it did after the late October selloff.<p>What is different now is that there is a wedge rally on the weekly chart and the EURUSD is near the resistance of the February 2018 high on the monthly chart. This increases the chance of a test down to the November low over the next couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market was sideways for most of the overnight session, but it broke strongly to the downside over the past 3 hours. When there is a break below a trading range that lasts several hours, the breakout usually is relatively brief, and then the EURUSD goes sideways again.<p>That is a Bear Trending Trading Range Day. The bears want the day to accelerate down, and the bulls want it to reverse back up to the initial trading range. But the most common outcome is two or three quick legs down in a sell climax, and then exhaustion followed by another trading range.<p>When the EURUSD is in a strong bear breakout, as it is at the moment, day traders are only selling. But if there is a 30-pip bounce, which is likely within a couple hours, they will begin to bet on a trading range. The bulls will look to buy reversals back up from new legs down, betting on a trading range. There is a 20% chance that a reversal up will continue back up to the high of the day. The bears will switch to selling rallies instead of selling at the market.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But Tuesday was a doji bar and that is a weak buy signal bar. Yesterday barely closed above the buy signal bar high.<p>The bulls want the rally to test Friday’s high and close. That would allow those Buy The Close bulls from Friday to exit without a loss. If enough exit, it could create a double top and begin a correction down.<p>Unless the Emini breaks strongly above last week’s high, traders should still expect a reversal down to 3500 to begin this month. However, the bears need a good sell signal bar, or a surprisingly big reversal down before traders will conclude that the profit taking is underway. Until then, traders will continue to expect higher prices.<p>Yesterday was the 7th consecutive day without a bear body. That is unusual and therefore unsustainable. This streak is therefore a type of buy climax. It increases the chance of a bear day today. If today is within about 10 points of today’s open in the final hour, it could get drawn there by the end of the day.<p>What about impeachment, with the buy climax ignoring impeachment? The market already factored that in, and it does not care. But if there is unacceptable violence within the next couple weeks, it could be the catalyst for a pullback to 3500. In the meantime, traders continue to buy, knowing that a buy climax can go a long way before there is a reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open in the middle of its 5-day trading range. That increases the chance of more trading range trading today. However, today will probably have a bear body. Consequently, if there is a rally for several hours, traders will look for a midday reversal back down to below the open.<p>Suppose today sells off on the open. After 7 days without a bear body, day traders will look for a reversal back up to the open later in the day. However, since today will probably close below the open, if it is above the open late in the day, day traders will look for a reversal back down to the open.<p>What about a strong trend day up or down? That can happen at any time, but markets have inertia. That means they tend to continue to do what they’ve been doing. After going sideways for 5 days and opening in the middle of the range, it is more likely that today will be another mostly sideways day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel - with January buy climax ignoring impeachment\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is now near the bottom of the 2-month trading range. The bears want 2 closes below the January low. If they get that, they will look for a bear trend down to the November 4 low.<p>The bulls hope that this will be like every other strong selloff since March. They want it to form a higher low, and for the bull trend to resume, like it did after the late October selloff.<p>What is different now is that there is a wedge rally on the weekly chart and the EURUSD is near the resistance of the February 2018 high on the monthly chart. This increases the chance of a test down to the November low over the next couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market was sideways for most of the overnight session, but it broke strongly to the downside over the past 3 hours. When there is a break below a trading range that lasts several hours, the breakout usually is relatively brief, and then the EURUSD goes sideways again.<p>That is a Bear Trending Trading Range Day. The bears want the day to accelerate down, and the bulls want it to reverse back up to the initial trading range. But the most common outcome is two or three quick legs down in a sell climax, and then exhaustion followed by another trading range.<p>When the EURUSD is in a strong bear breakout, as it is at the moment, day traders are only selling. But if there is a 30-pip bounce, which is likely within a couple hours, they will begin to bet on a trading range. The bulls will look to buy reversals back up from new legs down, betting on a trading range. There is a 20% chance that a reversal up will continue back up to the high of the day. The bears will switch to selling rallies instead of selling at the market.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was an outside down bar, and it is a sell signal bar for today for a reversal down from above the 2-month bull channel. A breakout above bull trend channel that might be failing.<p>It is important to note that most reversal attempts in a bull trend simply become pullbacks. The bulls will continue to buy reversals until there are consecutive big bear days. At that point, traders will begin to believe that a correction is underway.<p>I have been saying that traders should look for a reversal to begin in January, but after January 6. We are now in that window. That increases the chance of a strong bear trend day coming at any time. With yesterday being a sell signal bar, there is an increased chance of a strong bear trend day today.<p>Can today be a strong bull day instead? Of course it can, but if today is going to be a big trend day, down is more likely than up.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. This week so far is a small inside bar on the weekly chart. The bears would like the week to close below the open of the week. The bears would then have their 1st bear bar on the weekly chart in 5 weeks. If the week closes on the low, it would be an ioi sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 16 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap down below yesterday’s low and below the open of the week. Since the open of the week is a key price this week, even if the Emini gaps below it, traders should expect a bounce up to test it in the 1st hour.<p>The bulls hope that the bounce will grow into a bull trend day. The bears want a reversal down from a test of the open of the week, and for the selloff to continue all day.<p>Which is more likely? Well, neither. After 5 sideways days trading in a small range, there is an increased chance of today being another trading range day. That means at least one swing up and one swing down. And then, in the final hour, traders will decide if the week will close above or below the open of the week. As I said, a 5th consecutive bull bar on the weekly chart is getting unusual. That increases the chance of the week closing below the open.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-15.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then bear channel.

Today is Friday, and if the bears can get today to close near the low of the week, they would increase their chance of lower prices next week. They want consecutive closes below the January 1 low. That would make a traders begin to look for a 300-pip measured move down, based on the height of the trading range.<p>Most trading range breakouts fail. Therefore, the bulls will try to get a reversal up from around the January low. It could come from a higher low, or from a breakout below that quickly reverses up. But the bulls need consecutive closes above the January 6 top of the range, before traders will look for a 300-pip measured move up. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Trading ranges can last a long time.<p>There is a wedge top on the weekly chart (I post it in my weekend updates), and the January high is near the top of a 6-year trading range on the monthly chart (I sometimes post that as well). Therefore, as relentless as the rally has been since March, there is an increased chance of a selloff over the next couple months. The bears still need to do more before traders will conclude that it is underway.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has drifted down in a weak bear channel overnight. But it is still above yesterday’s low. The bulls want a 2nd consecutive reversal up, like yesterday. That would increase the chance of a rally next week.<p>The bears do not need the selloff to continue any lower today. Their focus is the weekly chart. They want the week to close near its low. If the EURUSD simply stays sideways, there would be a strong bear bar on the weekly chart. That would make traders expect lower prices next week.<p>The overnight selloff had many little reversals on the way down and it lacked sustained selling. Furthermore, the EURUSD has been sideways for 5 hours. Despite the selloff, day traders are willing to buy as well as sell. They have been scalping for 10 pips for several hours.<p>The bulls want a trend reversal up to the high of the day. But just as the bears have not had a series of consecutive big bear bars on the way down, so far the bulls have been unable to get a strong reversal up. And even if they do, they simply want the day to close around the open, which is only 20 pips above the current price.<p>With neither the bulls nor the bears needing a big move from here, and with the chart beginning to go sideways, day traders will continue to scalp in both directions.

It was an outside down bar, and it is a sell signal bar for today for a reversal down from above the 2-month bull channel. A breakout above bull trend channel that might be failing.<p>It is important to note that most reversal attempts in a bull trend simply become pullbacks. The bulls will continue to buy reversals until there are consecutive big bear days. At that point, traders will begin to believe that a correction is underway.<p>I have been saying that traders should look for a reversal to begin in January, but after January 6. We are now in that window. That increases the chance of a strong bear trend day coming at any time. With yesterday being a sell signal bar, there is an increased chance of a strong bear trend day today.<p>Can today be a strong bull day instead? Of course it can, but if today is going to be a big trend day, down is more likely than up.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. This week so far is a small inside bar on the weekly chart. The bears would like the week to close below the open of the week. The bears would then have their 1st bear bar on the weekly chart in 5 weeks. If the week closes on the low, it would be an ioi sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 16 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap down below yesterday’s low and below the open of the week. Since the open of the week is a key price this week, even if the Emini gaps below it, traders should expect a bounce up to test it in the 1st hour.<p>The bulls hope that the bounce will grow into a bull trend day. The bears want a reversal down from a test of the open of the week, and for the selloff to continue all day.<p>Which is more likely? Well, neither. After 5 sideways days trading in a small range, there is an increased chance of today being another trading range day. That means at least one swing up and one swing down. And then, in the final hour, traders will decide if the week will close above or below the open of the week. As I said, a 5th consecutive bull bar on the weekly chart is getting unusual. That increases the chance of the week closing below the open.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-15.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then bear channel.

Today is Friday, and if the bears can get today to close near the low of the week, they would increase their chance of lower prices next week. They want consecutive closes below the January 1 low. That would make a traders begin to look for a 300-pip measured move down, based on the height of the trading range.<p>Most trading range breakouts fail. Therefore, the bulls will try to get a reversal up from around the January low. It could come from a higher low, or from a breakout below that quickly reverses up. But the bulls need consecutive closes above the January 6 top of the range, before traders will look for a 300-pip measured move up. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Trading ranges can last a long time.<p>There is a wedge top on the weekly chart (I post it in my weekend updates), and the January high is near the top of a 6-year trading range on the monthly chart (I sometimes post that as well). Therefore, as relentless as the rally has been since March, there is an increased chance of a selloff over the next couple months. The bears still need to do more before traders will conclude that it is underway.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has drifted down in a weak bear channel overnight. But it is still above yesterday’s low. The bulls want a 2nd consecutive reversal up, like yesterday. That would increase the chance of a rally next week.<p>The bears do not need the selloff to continue any lower today. Their focus is the weekly chart. They want the week to close near its low. If the EURUSD simply stays sideways, there would be a strong bear bar on the weekly chart. That would make traders expect lower prices next week.<p>The overnight selloff had many little reversals on the way down and it lacked sustained selling. Furthermore, the EURUSD has been sideways for 5 hours. Despite the selloff, day traders are willing to buy as well as sell. They have been scalping for 10 pips for several hours.<p>The bulls want a trend reversal up to the high of the day. But just as the bears have not had a series of consecutive big bear bars on the way down, so far the bulls have been unable to get a strong reversal up. And even if they do, they simply want the day to close around the open, which is only 20 pips above the current price.<p>With neither the bulls nor the bears needing a big move from here, and with the chart beginning to go sideways, day traders will continue to scalp in both directions.

If there is follow-through selling this week, the selloff could continue down to the November 4 low at around 1.16.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-weekly-chart-had-weak-follow-through-after-last-weeks-bear-breakout\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart had weak follow-through after last week’s bear breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-possible-failed-bear-breakout-below-bull-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-16.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has possible failed bear breakout below bull trend line\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures formed a big bear bar last week, and it closed far below the bottom of its 9-month trading range. This week was the follow-through bar, but it was disappointing for the bears.<p>If this week was a big bear bar closing on its low, traders would be expecting a quick selloff to the March low. But this week was a bull doji bar. That is a bad follow-through bar. However, its small body makes it a low probability buy setup after last week’s big bear breakout.<p>So if it is bad follow-through and a weak reversal setup, what should traders expect? Confusion typically results in sideways trading. Therefore, there is an increased chance of the bond market going sideways for a week or two. Traders wanted a clear sign that the breakout would succeed or fail. They did not get it. They now need more information, which means more bars.<p>Even though this week was a bull bar, its body was small compared to the body of last week’s bear breakout bar. Therefore, the chart is still slightly bearish.<p>But if next week forms a big bull bar, it will erase last week’s bear bar. Traders would then conclude that the breakout failed.<p>Alternatively, if next week is a big bear bar, traders will conclude that this week was just a pause in a bear trend. They will again expect a test of the March low and possibly the January 2, 2020 low.<h2 id=\"3-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"4-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-reversing-down-from-a-nested-wedge-top\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart is reversing down from a nested wedge top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-reversal-down-from-nested-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has reversal down from nested wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market this week on the weekly chart, formed a big bear bar that closed near its low. This is the 2nd reversal down from a nested wedge top, and it is therefore a higher probability sell signal. The odds favor lower prices. The bears want a 2nd big bear bar next week to confirm the reversal. That would increase the chance of a trend reversal down.<p>When a wedge reverses, traders look for certain things. They expect at least a couple legs sideways to down. Also, the correction often has about half as many bars as the wedge rally.<p>The rally lasted 9 months. Will the selloff continue for 4 months? While it might, it probably will only be 2 or 3 months, assuming this is the start of a correction. Why? Because a reversal from a wedge top often stops at the bottom of the pullback after the 2nd leg up. That is the trading range from August through early November, and the low is around 1.16. It won’t take 4 months to get there, if this is the start of a correction.<p>What happens if next week forms a big bull bar, and totally reverses this week’s selloff? Traders would then think that the move up to 1.25 was still intact. But after a clear wedge top and a strong reversal down, more sideways to down trading is likely.<p>The 9-month bull channel on the weekly chart is a sign of strong bulls. But it is important to remember that the entire rally is just a leg up in a 6-year trading range on the monthly chart.<a aria-label=\"I showed that last week (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-breakout-above-bull-channel/#4-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-a-wedge-rally-to-top-of-6-year-trading-range\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">I showed that last week</a>. Therefore, traders should expect a pullback from a wedge rally to the top of that range.<p>Can the EURUSD reverse all the way down to below the 6 year range? It probably will not. If you look at that monthly chart, the entire selloff from the 2008 high looks more like a bull flag than a bear trend. This year’s reversal up was a double bottom. The odds are that the EURUSD will be sideways to up for at least another year. But, it is now likely starting to pull back for at least a couple months.<h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"6-monthly-emini-chart-has-only-a-doji-bar-in-its-breakout-above-top-of-nested-bull-channels\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has only a doji bar in its breakout above top of nested bull channels</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-is-stalling-at-top-of-nested-bull-channels.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart is stalling at top of nested bull channels\"></a></figure><p>The candlestick on the monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart so far in January is a small bull doji bar, which is neutral. This follows 2 big bull bars, and it is a sign of a loss of momentum. Emini January rally stalling.<p>I have mentioned that the November/December strong rally follow a bad High 1 bull flag. September and October were bear bars, and they therefore created a weak buy setup. Additionally, the bad bull flag came late in a bull trend. That combination usually leads to a minor breakout. There is typically a 2nd reversal down after about a couple months.<p>The less bullish January is when the month closes, the more likely the Emini will begin to pull back in February. If January were to close on its low, it would be a strong sell signal bar for a reversal down from above a bad bull flag. That would probably result in a pullback for at least a month.<p>Alternatively, if January closes near its high, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in February. The bigger the bull body in January, the stronger the bull trend.<p>What happens if January ends up with a small bull or bear body? It would reduce the chance of higher prices in February. However, it would be a weak sell signal bar. Traders would therefore expect February to be mostly sideways.<p>It is important to remember that the monthly chart is breaking above the top of nested bull channels. A breakout above a bull channel typically reverses down within about 5 bars. January is the 2nd bar. That reduces the chance of the Emini going much higher from here.<p>A nested pattern means there is one or more ways to draw the pattern. Here, there are 3 ways to draw the bull channel. A nested pattern has a higher probability of reversing.<h2 id=\"7-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-an-ioi-breakout-mode-pattern\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has an ioi Breakout Mode pattern</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-ioi-sell-signal-bar-in-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-16-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has ioi sell signal bar in buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart this week closed with a small bear body. Also, this week’s high was below last week’s high, and this week’s low was above last week’s low.<p>I wrote last week that there was an increased chance of an inside bar this week, after last week was a big outside up bar late in a bull trend. Well, this week ended inside. There is now an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern on the weekly chart. That is a Breakout Mode pattern. This week is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for next week.<p>What happens if the buy signal triggers next week? Last week was an extreme buy climax bar, in a climactic rally from the October low. When there is trend resumption up after an extreme buy climax, it typically only lasts for a bar or two. There is then typically some profit taking, and at least a couple small legs sideways to down. Also, because this week had a bear body, it is a less reliable buy signal bar. There might be more sellers than buyers above its high.<p>But what if next week breaks below this week’s low? That would trigger the sell signal. Because the 9-week bull channel is tight, the reversal would probably be minor. An obvious target is the start of the channel, which is the November 10 low at around 3500. Traders should expect some profit taking soon. I have been saying that it would probably begin in January, but after January 6. That is still likely.<h2 id=\"8-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-is-stalling-at-top-of-bull-channel\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is stalling at top of bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-micro-double-top-in-spike-and-channel-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-16-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has micro double top in spike and channel bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a bull channel since November 10. This followed a strong breakout in early November (a bull spike). A Spike and Channel bull trend typically evolves into a trading range. Traders expect a break below the bull trend line (the bottom of the channel), and then at least a couple legs down. The selloff usually tests down to near the start of the channel. That November 10 low is around 3500, which is therefore a magnet below.<p>But channels can go a long way before reversing. However, the Emini is now breaking above the top of the channel. A breakout above a bull channel usually reverses down within about 5 bars. This week’s sideways trading might be the start of the reversal down.<p>Friday was the first bear day that traded below a bear day, since the strong rally began on October 30. Is that a sign that a correction has begun? No, but it is something that increases the chance that a correction might begin soon.<p>It is important to note that Friday was not a big bear bar closing on its low. The tail on the low of the bar makes it less bearish.<p>You might notice that the close on the intraday chart is different from the close on the daily chart. On the 5-minute chart, the Emini closed at 3750.50 in the day session and 3746.25 in the Globex session on Friday. The CME uses an algorithm to calculate the close on the daily chart, and it can be very different from the close on the intraday chart. Today’s daily chart closed at 3762.25, which is 16 points above the close on the<a aria-label=\"5-minute chart on the CME's website (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500_quotes_globex.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">5-minute chart on the CME’s website</a>.<p>Until the bears get a couple consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows on the daily chart, traders will continue to buy every selloff. They know that most selloffs will be minor (bull flags), and that the bull trend will soon resume. While a reversal down to 3500 is likely to begin soon, there is no clear sign that the bull trend has ended.<p>There is one other noteworthy event this week. Friday collapsed, but reversed up strongly. It was simply a test of last year’s close. The market usually tests last year’s close at least a couple times.<p>It also occasionally tests other significant prices. For example, the 2020 pandemic crash was also just a test of the January 19, 2017 close. That was the price when President Trump took office. The selloff erased his entire bull trend, but the incredibly strong reversal up erased the entire selloff, and restored all of the gains and then some!<h2 id=\"9-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

I’m Al Brooks. Thank you so much for your attention. At the end of every day, I look at charts to try to get an idea about what to expect for tomorrow. I do the same at the end of the week, the end of the month, and now at the end of the year. This is the New Year’s Day weekend, and I made a series of charts to create videos to give my thoughts about what to expect for major markets in 2021. I made six different videos – Emini, the bond market, the Euro versus the dollar Forex market, gold, crude oil, and Bitcoin.<p>Now, I want to add a disclaimer up front: with every additional tick that we see, the outlook changes. I’m giving you my perspective as of right now, the start of 2021. I hope that you find the information useful.<h2>EURUSD Forex market outlook for 2021</h2><p>I’m going to talk about the euro versus the dollar in this video and my outlook for 2021. This is as of January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021. Every new tick, every little move up or down that the euro does from here on gives new information. This report that I’m doing today is as of January 1<sup>st</sup>.<h2>EURUSD Forex monthly chart</h2><p>This is a monthly chart of the euro versus the dollar. We had a very strong bull trend from 2000 to 2008, and we’ve been in a bear channel since then. We had a bear breakout and then a second attempt at a bottom. This low is above that low, so it’s still more likely that this is a bull flag, a pullback from this bull trend, even though the pullback has gone on for 12 years. You can draw a Triangle or you can just call this a bear channel. A bear channel usually gets a bull breakout, and therefore you treat it like a bull flag. You expect the market to go higher.<p>We broke above the bear trend line this year, and the bulls are hoping that this is the start of a move up that gets us up here or all the way back up here. It’s too early to tell. The bulls first have to get above this Lower High, and we currently have a Wedge rally. So it’s not as strong as what people on television make it sound.<h3>A six-year Trading Range</h3><p>Also, this is a 6-year Trading Range and we’re at the top of the range. We have not yet broken out. If we do break out, the bulls will look at this as a Double Bottom – this low, that low. This is the neckline, and they’ll want a Measured Move up, which gets us back into this Trading Range from 2008 to 2014. Bears, they want a Double Top. They see this as a Trading Range and this as a bull leg in the range. We have a Double Bottom here; they want a Double Top here, and if it reverses down, we could stay in the range for another several years before we break out either to the upside or the downside. Right now we’re getting the bull breakout, but we also have to break strongly above this Lower High.<p>Here’s what I mean by a 6-year Trading Range, and we’re testing the top of the range now. Until there’s a breakout, there is no breakout, and we do not have the breakout yet. We have a breakout above the bear trend line, but not above the Trading Range. We still have a Lower High, and this still could be part of a bear channel. The bulls need to break above the Lower High to end the series of Lower Highs. A bear trend means Lower Highs. If you stop getting Lower Highs, you’re no longer in a bear trend. You could be in a Trading Range, but you could also be in a bull trend.<p>Most attempts to break out of a Trading Range fail, and Trading Ranges can last a long time. But the two things that I think are most important is even though we sold off for a lot of years, we’re still forming a Higher Low, so this still is more likely a bull flag, and we’re breaking above the top of the bear channel, so this is the start of a breakout above a bull flag. We next have to break strongly above that, and if we do that, then we could go quite a bit higher. Maybe a Measured Move up to here.<h2>EURUSD Forex weekly chart</h2><p>This is a weekly chart, and you can see three pushes up – one, pause, two, pause, three. So we have a Wedge rally here and there’s also a Wedge here – one, two, and three. We’re not quite up to that line, but if this is the start of a reversal down, I would redraw the line and say this is Point 1, that’s Point 2, and Point 3 is right there. We have an Outside Down bar. We went above the high of that bar and then below the low of that bar. But this week did not close below that bar, and it had a fairly conspicuous tail below, so this is not nearly as bearish as it could be. It still could go sideways and then up.<p>Nested Wedge. We have a smaller Wedge, and it’s the third leg up in a bigger Wedge. But unless we get a strong downside breakout, it’s still in a bull channel and the odds still favor higher prices.<h2>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h2><p>Here’s the daily chart, and at the end of the year, January 1<sup>st</sup>, we had 2 very big bear bars. We have a spike up and a channel. Three legs – one, two, three – and we’re breaking below the bull trend line. I don’t have it drawn in. But look at the low of this bar. We have a very big tail, a very big bounce. It could be simply a breakout test of that breakout point. We were in a Trading Range for a long time, and we broke above it, and this could be simply a test of that breakout point.<p>Also, when you have a spike pullback channel, the market typically comes down to the start of the channel and bounces. The bulls hope it’s a Double Bottom, we break above the neckline and go up for a Measured Move. The bears hope that we bounce to a Lower High or a Double Top and break below the neckline of the Double Top – so that high and maybe this high – and then go down here. If we do go down, the bears really need to drive it down strongly, down here, to make traders think that the bulls have lost control. Right now it’s still more likely that the best the bears get will be a Trading Range. Might get a couple legs down – one, bounce, two – maybe three legs down – one, bounce, two, bounce, three. But chances are whatever selloff we get here will be a bull flag and it will try to go higher.<h3>A breakout test of support or bounce?</h3><p>A bull breakout, so a spike up and then a channel. Three pushes. You expect a break below the bull channel and a test of the start of the channel and then a bounce. So we’ve done all of that. Now we’ll decide: is this just a breakout test of support, and will we go up, Double Bottom here? Or will we bounce and continue sideways? Or will we form a Lower High and get another second or a third leg down?<p>The bears would like a second or third leg down. They’d like to get a Major Trend Reversal. But this is a pretty Tight Bull Channel, and the weekly and monthly charts look pretty good for the bulls. So chances are this is not going to be a reversal into a bear trend. Chances are we’ll either go sideways or a little bit down and then we’ll try to continue higher. The bears are hoping that this is a big enough bear surprise so that we’ll get at least a second leg down. And we might. Sometimes it’ll even come all the way back up here or go a little bit above the top of the spike and then have a second leg down.<h2>Concluding comments</h2><p>In any case, whether or not we get a second leg down, at the moment it looks like we’ll probably go higher. It looks like we’re going to get a second leg down. This is a very big bear surprise. Even if we get back up here or even a little bit above, I still think the odds are we’re going to get a second leg down.<p>Again, this is my take on the euro versus the dollar for the coming year.<h3>Close</h3><p>Again, I’m Al Brooks. Thank you so much for your attention. I hope that you found some of this information useful. I want to wish you the best for the coming year as a trader, and I also want to wish you and your family a very wonderful 2021.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"></div></article>"

A bear bar is a bad buy signal bar for an Emini weak High 2 bull flag. That reduces the chance that the overnight rally will lead to a strong bull trend. It might instead simply add another bar or two to the 7-day tight trading range.<p>Friday was the 1st time since the October 30 low that the Emini had consecutive bear bars where the 2nd bear bar was lower than the first. This subtle increase in selling pressure increases the chance that the Small Pullback Bull Trend might end soon.<p>There is a bear ioi pattern on the weekly chart. For the bulls, last week is a pullback in a tight bull channel. It is a High 1 buy signal bar. But it had a bear body, and that increases the chance that there might be more sellers than buyers above its high.<p>If this week falls below last week’s low on the weekly chart, it will trigger an ioi sell signal. That will increase the chance that a move down to 3500 is underway. But with the weekly chart in a tight bull channel, the reversal down would probably be minor. A reasonable target would be the start of the channel at around 3500.<p>The bulls want this week to close on its high to erase last week’s bear bar. That would make traders look for at least slightly higher prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 26 points in the Globex session. It therefore will probably gap above Friday’s high, which would trigger a High 2 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. But if the gap is small, it probably will close in the 1st hour and become unimportant.<p>The Emini will open within the trading range of the past 6 days. The top of the range is 3820, which is only about 30 points above the current Globex price. Additionally, the all-time high is just a few points above that range, and it is an important magnet. Also, the Emini has made many new all-time highs in the past couple months. This increases the chance of a bull trend day today, but not necessarily a huge bull trend.<p>The bears want a lower high or double top on the daily chart. They hope that the January 8 all-time high is the start of a selloff down to the November 10 low at around 3500.<p>With most of the days over the past month having at least one reversal, traders will expect at least one reversal today. But if the Emini forms an early Small Pullback Bull Trend that lasts at least a couple hours, day traders would continue to only buy.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-then-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-19.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and then bear trend resumption.

However, yesterday was a bear bar, and that is a weak buy signal bar. Also, the selloff was strong. That makes it likely that the 1st leg up will be minor.<p>For example, it might stall at the January 13 high. The bears will try to create a double top with that high. If there is a lower high, the bears will hope that it is the start of a lower high major trend reversal. It would also be a head and shoulders top. A major reversal has a 40% chance of actually leading to a reversal into a bear trend. More often, the market continues sideways.<p>Don’t forget the January 6 wedge top. A reversal down from a wedge top usually has a couple legs. While there is a 2nd leg down that began on January 13, when the 2nd leg begins within a tight bear channel, the entire channel is usually just a complex 1st leg down. Consequently, unless this rally becomes very strong this week, traders will expect at least a test of yesterday’s low after a test of the January 13 minor lower high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly overnight. Day traders have only been buying.<p>Since the day’s range is almost as big as most of the big days of the past month, there is probably not too much left to the rally today. If the EURUSD starts to go sideways, day traders will switch to scalping.<p>If the trading range is about 30-pips tall, day traders will also begin to sell for scalps. There is only a 20% chance that today will reverse back down to the low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

While the odds always favor a new high when the market is in a bull channel, after a channel has lasted 50 bars, the odds of a reversal down increase.

A bear bar is a bad buy signal bar for an Emini weak High 2 bull flag. That reduces the chance that the overnight rally will lead to a strong bull trend. It might instead simply add another bar or two to the 7-day tight trading range.<p>Friday was the 1st time since the October 30 low that the Emini had consecutive bear bars where the 2nd bear bar was lower than the first. This subtle increase in selling pressure increases the chance that the Small Pullback Bull Trend might end soon.<p>There is a bear ioi pattern on the weekly chart. For the bulls, last week is a pullback in a tight bull channel. It is a High 1 buy signal bar. But it had a bear body, and that increases the chance that there might be more sellers than buyers above its high.<p>If this week falls below last week’s low on the weekly chart, it will trigger an ioi sell signal. That will increase the chance that a move down to 3500 is underway. But with the weekly chart in a tight bull channel, the reversal down would probably be minor. A reasonable target would be the start of the channel at around 3500.<p>The bulls want this week to close on its high to erase last week’s bear bar. That would make traders look for at least slightly higher prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 26 points in the Globex session. It therefore will probably gap above Friday’s high, which would trigger a High 2 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. But if the gap is small, it probably will close in the 1st hour and become unimportant.<p>The Emini will open within the trading range of the past 6 days. The top of the range is 3820, which is only about 30 points above the current Globex price. Additionally, the all-time high is just a few points above that range, and it is an important magnet. Also, the Emini has made many new all-time highs in the past couple months. This increases the chance of a bull trend day today, but not necessarily a huge bull trend.<p>The bears want a lower high or double top on the daily chart. They hope that the January 8 all-time high is the start of a selloff down to the November 10 low at around 3500.<p>With most of the days over the past month having at least one reversal, traders will expect at least one reversal today. But if the Emini forms an early Small Pullback Bull Trend that lasts at least a couple hours, day traders would continue to only buy.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-then-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-19.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and then bear trend resumption.

It has been in a tight trading range for 9 days, and in a bull channel for more than 2 months, with Biden’s inauguration today. Traders expect a break below the bull trend line and a test of the start of the channel. That is the November 10 low at around 3500.<p>However, channels can last a long time before the bulls take profits. Additionally, there has not been a big bear day in 11 days, and there is no top yet. But because this channel has lasted about 50 bars, which is unusually long, traders should get a reversal down within a few weeks.<p>While the bull trend is intact and there is a measured move target above at 3895, the bulls only have a 25% chance of a successful breakout above the bull channel, and the evolution into a stronger bull trend.<h3>The importance of the close of January 19, 2021</h3><p>Yesterday’s close will be important for the next 4 years. Why? Because it is the final close before Biden takes office. Traders will refer to it to determine how the stock market performed under Biden.<p>For example, during the pandemic low last year, I pointed out that the selloff fell below the January 19, 2017 low, which was the close on the day before Trump took office. That meant that all of the gains of his presidency were completely erased. However, the strong reversal back up more than made up for the loss.<p>The point is that the January 19, 2017 close was tested several times during his presidency, even in the final year. Whether the stock market goes up or down over the next few years, yesterday’s close will be a magnet, and it probably will be tested several times.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 19 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above yesterday’s high. It is only about 14 points below the all-time high, and it is in a strong bull trend channel on the daily chart.<p>Traders expect a test of the all-time high today. With the gap up in a bull trend just below the all-time high, there is an increased chance of a bull trend today. But if there is a bull trend, there is an increased chance of a reversal down in the middle of the day from around the old high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-20.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day.

Today so far is a bear bar. It is also a 2-day pullback in the selloff. That makes it a Low 1 sell signal bar.<p>However, a Low 1 bear flag at the bottom of a trading range is a low probability sell setup because most attempts to break out of a trading range fail. Furthermore, a break below today’s low would be a 3rd leg down. A third leg down typically attracts profit taking. That means at least a minor reversal up from a wedge bottom.<p>The bears will have a better chance of a successful breakout if today closes on its low. However, the selloff has lost momentum over the past 6 days. That increases the chance that the EURUSD will bounce back to the middle of the range if it sells off in the next few days, down to the January 1 low at the bottom of the range.<p>The bears want consecutive closes below that January 1 low. If they get them, traders will look for a measured move down to the next support. That is the November 4 low.<p>What is more likely, a breakout above or below the range? The wedge top on the weekly chart (not shown) makes the bear breakout more likely. However, a trading range can last a long time before there is a breakout, and most breakout attempts fail. Consequently, traders expect a reversal up within a week to the middle of the range.<p>But if that bounce reverses down again, traders would begin to see a head and shoulders top on the daily chart, in addition to the wedge top on the weekly chart. The odds of a bear breakout would go up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied early in the overnight session, but then sold off in a tight bear channel to the low of the day. Because the selloff has been strong, day traders have only been selling. But if the bulls get a 20- to 30-pip bounce, day traders will begin to buy as well.<p>At the moment, the bulls only have a 20% chance of a reversal back to the high of the day. However, they would like today to bounce back up to near the open. Today would then be a doji bar on the daily chart. It would be a weaker sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The bears do not need the bear trend to continue all day. If today closes where it is now, the bears would have a good sell signal bar on the daily chart. Their goal at this point is to have the day close near its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow.<p>Since they do not need the bear trend on the 5-minute chart to continue, they will probably soon begin to sell rallies instead of at the market. That will convert the strong bear trend into a trading range.<p>Once that happens, bull day traders will begin to buy reversals up from the low for scalps. However, unless there is a strong bull trend reversal, which currently is unlikely, bear traders will look to sell all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It has been in a tight trading range for 9 days, and in a bull channel for more than 2 months, with Biden’s inauguration today. Traders expect a break below the bull trend line and a test of the start of the channel. That is the November 10 low at around 3500.<p>However, channels can last a long time before the bulls take profits. Additionally, there has not been a big bear day in 11 days, and there is no top yet. But because this channel has lasted about 50 bars, which is unusually long, traders should get a reversal down within a few weeks.<p>While the bull trend is intact and there is a measured move target above at 3895, the bulls only have a 25% chance of a successful breakout above the bull channel, and the evolution into a stronger bull trend.<h3>The importance of the close of January 19, 2021</h3><p>Yesterday’s close will be important for the next 4 years. Why? Because it is the final close before Biden takes office. Traders will refer to it to determine how the stock market performed under Biden.<p>For example, during the pandemic low last year, I pointed out that the selloff fell below the January 19, 2017 low, which was the close on the day before Trump took office. That meant that all of the gains of his presidency were completely erased. However, the strong reversal back up more than made up for the loss.<p>The point is that the January 19, 2017 close was tested several times during his presidency, even in the final year. Whether the stock market goes up or down over the next few years, yesterday’s close will be a magnet, and it probably will be tested several times.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 19 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above yesterday’s high. It is only about 14 points below the all-time high, and it is in a strong bull trend channel on the daily chart.<p>Traders expect a test of the all-time high today. With the gap up in a bull trend just below the all-time high, there is an increased chance of a bull trend today. But if there is a bull trend, there is an increased chance of a reversal down in the middle of the day from around the old high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-20.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day.

I’m Al Brooks. Thank you so much for your attention. At the end of every day, I look at charts to try to get an idea about what to expect for tomorrow. I do the same at the end of the week, the end of the month, and now at the end of the year.<p>This is the New Year’s Day weekend, and I made a series of charts to create videos to give my thoughts about what to expect for major markets in 2021. I made six different videos – Emini, the bond market, the Euro versus the dollar Forex market, gold, crude oil, and Bitcoin.<p>Now, I want to add a disclaimer up front: with every additional tick that we see, the outlook changes. I’m giving you my perspective as of right now, the start of 2021. I hope that you find the information useful.<h2>Bitcoin crytocurrency market outlook for 2021</h2><p>In this video, I want to talk about one of the most interesting markets currently, and that’s Bitcoin. This is my outlook for Bitcoin for the coming year.<h3>Weekly chart for Bitcoin</h3><p>At the end of 2020, this is what the weekly chart looked like. Extremely strong bull trend. We had a good rally here, a better one here, and an even stronger one here. The bears hoped for a Double Top back here in early December, but instead of reversing down, we broke strongly to the upside. We’re almost to a Measured Move up based upon the height of this initial top. If we get there, which I’m sure we will, there might be some profit-taking. We may hesitate, pull back.<p>We have 3 big bull bars here. We had 5 big bull bars here, and this is what followed. We had a huge reversal down.<p>Is this going to be like this, and will we drop down and retrace almost the entire bull trend? I don’t think so. What’s different? Well, a lot of it is fundamental. You have a lot more institutional participation, and then additionally, this trend I think is stronger than that trend.<h3>Measured Move target</h3><p>Room to the Measured Move target, but it’s a minor target because most computers will not realize it’s there. I realize it’s there. We tried to top out here, and instead of reversing down or stalling, we accelerated up. That is a common situation that results in a Measured Move target and profit-taking around that target.<p>Also, we have some shrinking bodies. This body is bigger than this one. This one is bigger than that one. So there is some loss of momentum. And then you look at unusually big bull bars like that; they typically attract some profit-taking exhaustion, so those factors increase the chances that we’ll pause, pull back, go sideways, maybe down a little bit, starting soon.<p>There’s no top yet, and this rally is so incredibly strong. Even if we were to come all the way down here, the best the bears would get would be a Trading Range. When you look at this, odds are we’re going higher. We don’t know the path. It could be straight up, or we could go sideways and then up, or we could go down and then up, but chances are we’re going up.<h3>Extreme Buy Climax</h3><p>Huge bars means an extreme Buy Climax, and that typically attracts profit-takers. If you’re a bull, your stop is way down here and you don’t want to risk 60%, 70% of your investment. The easiest way to reduce risk is to take some profits to reduce your position size. So when you get an extremely strong rally, you tend to get some profit-taking.<p>The profit-taking may initially be only a bar or two. If it is, it’ll probably be a High 1 bull flag, a 1 or 2 bar pause, and then we’ll go a little bit higher. But if we do have a 1 or 2 bar pause and we go higher, chances are the next leg up will only be a bar or two and we’ll get more of a pullback.<p>So the trend resumption will be brief. If we have a 1 or a 2 bar pullback and then the bull trend resumes, it probably will be brief, and then we’ll probably get more of a pullback, more bars and maybe a couple legs sideways to down.<h2>Example of accelerated Buy Climax</h2><p>This is an example of an accelerated Buy Climax. We tried to top out here, and then instead we accelerated upward, similar to what we have in Bitcoin. This is from my Brooks Encyclopedia. I have a collection of a couple thousand slides. I use them in my chatroom to illustrate points.<p>As strong as this was, it was a bull trap, and we had a big reversal down, a couple legs down here – one, two – and it grew into a bigger two-legged pattern – one, pullback, two. I don’t think we’re going to retrace this much of the Bitcoin rally, but we might get down to the bottom of the Buy Climax. If the bears get a big bear bar closing on its low, or near its low like this, bulls will exit and we’ll probably get at least a small couple legs down.<h3>Bitcoin accelerated up</h3><p>This is, again, Bitcoin. We tried to pause or top out here, and instead accelerated up, like in the example that I just showed. Will we reverse down all the way to here or here, like in that example? I don’t think we’ll go here, but it’s possible over the next few months we may work back down here.<p>This is so strongly up, I think initially if we pull back, we might get 5 or 10 bars sideways to down. I doubt that we’re going to go straight down. When a bull trend looks like that, usually the first reversal is minor and all you get is a Trading Range. And even if we were to get a Trading Range, that Trading Range would need 20 or more bars before there would be close to a 50% chance that we would get a reversal down.<h2>Concluding comments</h2><p>Buy Climax. No top yet, but probably will attract profit-taking within the next few bars, next few weeks.<p>Again, that’s my take on Bitcoin for the coming year.<h3>Close</h3><p>Again, I’m Al Brooks. Thank you so much for your attention. I hope that you found some of this information useful. I want to wish you the best for the coming year as a trader, and I also want to wish you and your family a very wonderful 2021.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"></div></article>"

Traders will refer to it to determine how the stock market performed under Biden.<p>For example, during the pandemic low last year, I pointed out that the selloff fell below the January 19, 2017 low, which was the close on the day before Trump took office. That meant that all of the gains of his presidency were completely erased. However, the strong reversal back up more than made up for the loss.<p>The point is that the January 19, 2017 close was tested several times during his presidency, even in the final year. Whether the stock market goes up or down over the next few years, yesterday’s close will be a magnet, and it probably will be tested several times.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 19 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above yesterday’s high. It is only about 14 points below the all-time high, and it is in a strong bull trend channel on the daily chart.<p>Traders expect a test of the all-time high today. With the gap up in a bull trend just below the all-time high, there is an increased chance of a bull trend today. But if there is a bull trend, there is an increased chance of a reversal down in the middle of the day from around the old high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-20.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day.

Today so far is a bear bar. It is also a 2-day pullback in the selloff. That makes it a Low 1 sell signal bar.<p>However, a Low 1 bear flag at the bottom of a trading range is a low probability sell setup because most attempts to break out of a trading range fail. Furthermore, a break below today’s low would be a 3rd leg down. A third leg down typically attracts profit taking. That means at least a minor reversal up from a wedge bottom.<p>The bears will have a better chance of a successful breakout if today closes on its low. However, the selloff has lost momentum over the past 6 days. That increases the chance that the EURUSD will bounce back to the middle of the range if it sells off in the next few days, down to the January 1 low at the bottom of the range.<p>The bears want consecutive closes below that January 1 low. If they get them, traders will look for a measured move down to the next support. That is the November 4 low.<p>What is more likely, a breakout above or below the range? The wedge top on the weekly chart (not shown) makes the bear breakout more likely. However, a trading range can last a long time before there is a breakout, and most breakout attempts fail. Consequently, traders expect a reversal up within a week to the middle of the range.<p>But if that bounce reverses down again, traders would begin to see a head and shoulders top on the daily chart, in addition to the wedge top on the weekly chart. The odds of a bear breakout would go up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied early in the overnight session, but then sold off in a tight bear channel to the low of the day. Because the selloff has been strong, day traders have only been selling. But if the bulls get a 20- to 30-pip bounce, day traders will begin to buy as well.<p>At the moment, the bulls only have a 20% chance of a reversal back to the high of the day. However, they would like today to bounce back up to near the open. Today would then be a doji bar on the daily chart. It would be a weaker sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The bears do not need the bear trend to continue all day. If today closes where it is now, the bears would have a good sell signal bar on the daily chart. Their goal at this point is to have the day close near its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow.<p>Since they do not need the bear trend on the 5-minute chart to continue, they will probably soon begin to sell rallies instead of at the market. That will convert the strong bear trend into a trading range.<p>Once that happens, bull day traders will begin to buy reversals up from the low for scalps. However, unless there is a strong bull trend reversal, which currently is unlikely, bear traders will look to sell all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After a 3-bar pullback at the end of the 2nd hour, the rally resumed as a Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>After 11 am PST, there was a pullback to the EMA. When the Emini stays above the EMA for 50 bars, there is a 99.5% chance that there will be at least 3 bars with lows below the EMA, which happened today. The bulls then typically try for trend resumption up to a new high.<p>Today was a buy climax. There is only a 25% chance of a 2nd strong bull trend day tomorrow. Additionally, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday’s close will probably be tested several times over the next couple years. For example, the close of President Trump’s 1st day was tested in his 2nd and 4th years.<p>What is more important for Biden, the close of the 19th or 20th? It probably is different for different firms. I usually pay attention to the close of the 20th.<p>There is a magnet above at the measured move target of 3875.75, based on the September 24/October 30 double bottom. However, the day after a strong bull trend day has only a 25% chance of being another strong bull trend. If today is a bull trend day, it will probably be weaker, like a Trending Trading Range Day or a Broad Bull Channel.<p>Since yesterday’s rally was climactic, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading, beginning by the end of the 2nd hour.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. The final 3 hours yesterday, and the Globex session, have been testing the 3850 Big Round Number.<p>Buy climaxes like yesterday typically attract profit takers. Traders often refer to it as exhaustion, or an exhaustive buy climax. Most climaxes lead to trading ranges and not trend reversals. Consequently, day traders will look for a trading range today. That means at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>The 2-month bull channel on the daily chart has had many reversals after big trend days up and down. There is therefore a slightly higher probability of a big bear day today. But day traders are expecting a lot of trading range price action today. They will switch to trend trading if there is a strong series of trend bars in either direction.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-21.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open.

Trading ranges can last a long time. Most breakout attempts fail.<p>The EURUSD has been reversing up for several days after testing the bottom. This 3-day rally is a test of the January 13 lower high. If the bulls can break strongly above it, traders will expect another attempt to break above the top of the range.<p>The bears will try to form a double top with that high. If the EURUSD reverses down from there, traders would look for another test of the bottom of the range. The rally would be a lower high major trend reversal, and the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top. That would be a sell setup.<p>While that sounds great for the bears, there is only a 40% chance that any major trend reversal will actually lead to a major trend reversal. The bears would still need consecutive closes below the bottom of the range (the January 1 low) before traders will conclude that the trading range had broken out into a bear trend.<p>While a trading range is neutral, the probability fluctuates a little within it. It depends on the strength of the legs up and down, and on the ever-changing patterns.<p>There is currently better than a 50% chance that the bears will win. However, if this 3-day rally breaks strongly above the January 13 high, the odds will shift to being slightly in favor of the bulls. What happens around that January 13 high over the next week will be important. It will give traders a clue about what to expect over the next couple weeks and maybe over the next couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight. It is now above yesterday’s high. Traders expect a test of the January 13 lower high over the next few days.<p>The overnight rally has been in a bull channel. That is a weak trend. It usually evolves into a trading range. But until there is a 20-pip pullback, day traders will focus on buying. Once it transforms into a trading range, day traders will also sell for scalps.<p>Can today accelerate up and break above the January 13 lower high? Probably not. The 3-day rally has had a lot of overlap on the daily chart. It looks more like a weak leg up in the 2-month trading range on the daily chart, rather than the start of a bull trend.<p>What about a reversal down today? It is trading just above yesterday’s high, and yesterday was a bear day on the daily chart. That is not a good buy signal bar. It could reverse down, but traders really want to see what will happen at the January 13 high. Therefore, if today reverses down, it will probably be minor. There is still about 50 pips of room left to that magnet above, and the EURUSD will probably get there within a few days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-trading-range-day-with-wedge-tops-and-bottoms.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-21-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. This is especially true in the final hour. With this week being a big bull bar at a new all-time high, the bulls would like the week to close on its high. The bears would like it to close below last week’s high, but that is more than 30 points below today’s close and it might be out of reach tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

I’m Al Brooks. Thank you so much for your attention. At the end of every day, I look at charts to try to get an idea about what to expect for tomorrow.<p>I do the same at the end of the week, the end of the month, and now at the end of the year. This is the New Year’s Day weekend, and I made a series of charts to create videos to give my thoughts about what to expect for major markets in 2021. I made six different videos – Emini, the bond market, the Euro versus the dollar Forex market, gold, crude oil, and Bitcoin.<p>Now, I want to add a disclaimer up front: with every additional tick that we see, the outlook changes. I’m giving you my perspective as of right now, the start of 2021. I hope that you find the information useful.<p>In this video, I’m going to be talking about what I think crude oil futures will likely do over the coming years.<h2>Monthly chart for crude oil futures</h2><p>This is a monthly chart of crude oil. There was a sharp selloff here, a spike down. That typically will result in three legs down – one, two, and three – and then it typically gets a couple legs up – one, pullback, two. You can argue it’s already having two legs up – one, pullback, two – but normally the two legs up will have about half as many bars as the entire Wedge channel, and the entire Wedge channel is over 10 years, so we’ll probably be tending to drift up for at least a few years. This one, pullback, two is probably part of a complex first leg up, and it’s strong enough so I think we’ll probably get a third leg up to the channel. So it’s one, pullback, two, pullback, three or one, pullback, two, and then a test down to a Double Bottom and then three. But we should get above the top of that channel.<p>When we get there – somewhere there, somewhere above it, maybe the top of this Sell Climax – we’ll then get a test down, and I think the entire move up will be one and then pullback and then two, up here. The bulls would like to get back to the start of the channel, which is all the way up here, but I suspect it will take many years to get there, if ever. That’s about $150.<h3>Extreme Sell Climax</h3><p>This was an extreme Sell Climax. It doesn’t look like much compared to what we had over here, but it really was extreme. We went from basically about $100 down to about zero dollars in just a matter of months, and then we reversed up sharply.<p>Big down, big up creates big confusion, and confusion is a hallmark of a Trading Range. Typically after an extreme Sell Climax like that with a pretty good reversal like this, the market’s going to go sideways. We’re probably going to be sideways within the 6-year Trading Range for several years. Remember I said that we’re going to get two complex legs up. It might take a year or two or three to complete the first leg, and then a leg down might take a year or two down, and then another couple years up. So the entire process of testing up here could take several years.<p>You can see that this Trading Range is similar to this one in terms of length and in terms of height, and here’s that strong reversal up. It could be one, pullback, two, but it’s more likely that we’re going to go up for a lot more bars than just this after a 10-year bear trend or 11-year bear trend. This is not enough bars to correct a bear trend that lasted that long.<p>Third leg down – one, two, three. Typically you look for two legs up. One of my defaults is I look for the two legs up to have about half as many bars as there were in the Wedge down. So one, two, three over the course of maybe 11 or 12 years. Do I think we’re going to go up for 5 years? I don’t know, but I think we’re going up for a lot more than 1 year. I think it’ll probably take 2 or 3 years to get up here. And as I said, the bulls would like to come all the way up here.<p>The first target when you get a climactic reversal is a couple legs up to the top of the channel and to the top of the most recent Sell Climax. Probably up to the top of this Trading Range, so I think we’ll be somewhere in this area within a year or two.<h3>Crude oil market fair price</h3><p>The market thought this was a fair price for 6 years. When we get back into it, the market will be back in that fair price again. If we’re below it, the market thinks it’s cheap, we get back up to it, and if we try to get above it, the market will think it’s expensive and we’ll tend to come back to it. Therefore, I think this Trading Range is probably going to continue for at least another 2 or 3 years.<h3>Impact of world moving away from fossil fuels</h3><p>I know the argument the world is moving away from fossil fuels. I drive a Tesla. Lots of people will be driving electric cars. Will that prevent crude oil ever from rallying much again? Not necessarily. At a minimum we should get back up here. Technically, the charts after a Wedge Bottom – one, pullback, two, pullback, three – the market technically tends to test the top of that pullback from the second leg down, and if it can get above it, it would then try to test the top of the first pullback. So first selloff, first pullback, second selloff, second pullback, and then third selloff. This is probably going to be the low for many years. If the market does dip below it, there’ll be buyers below.<p>Now, for the bulls to get up here, they’ll probably need a couple closes. This is the monthly chart, so a couple bars closing above this high. If they get it, then we’ll probably test the next resistance, which is the top of that Trading Range. And again, if we get there, it’ll probably take many years.<p>Can the market stay sideways forever? Is the bull trend over forever? I think it’s a mistake to say that. The market has a Wedge Bottom – one, pullback, two, pullback, three. We should get a couple legs up over the next several years. We may stay sideways for another 5 or 10 years. We can’t go down much because this is getting near zero, and how far up can we go? Well, we have this resistance. I think we’ll be back up here, but not in the next 5 years or so.<h3>Affect of inflation on crude oil price</h3><p>And why is that? Because of inflation. At some point we’re going to get inflation again. $100 crude oil might seem expensive today, but if inflation gets up to 5% or 10% for a few years, all of a sudden $100 crude oil is not that expensive and the market getting back up to $150 would not be unreasonable. So I do think eventually we’ll get up here, but it might take a decade or more to get there. It might take many years of inflation that’s much greater than what we have now.<p>If you’ve only been trading for 3 or 4 years, your life experience is that inflation is virtually zero and that interest rates are virtually zero, but that’s not going to be the way it’ll always be. When I started trading back in the 1980s, inflation was crazy. It was very, very high. When Jimmy Carter was president, inflation was well over 10%.<p>But unless we get a dramatic increase in inflation, the best the bulls probably can get for the next 3 or 4 or 5 years is a test of the top of this range. At some point I think we’ll get there, but it might take 10 or more years, and it would take several years of inflation that is much higher than what we have right now.<h2>Weekly chart for crude oil futures</h2><p>Let me move on to the weekly chart. Obviously there was a big gap down here during that Sell Climax, and we’ve had two legs up – one, pullback, two. Both legs, this and this, are really strong. When the second leg is strong after a strong first leg, you typically get a third leg. So one, sideways, two, a pullback sideways or down, and then three. And here’s the top of that channel, so we should get there. This is the top of that Sell Climax, so we should get there.<p>As I said earlier, I don’t know if we have a pullback to a Higher Low and then we go up there, or if we come down here and form a Double Bottom and then go up there, or if we come down here and form a Higher Low Major Trend Reversal. But of all the things that can happen, the one that is most certain is at some point in the next couple years, we’ll be at this trend line or a little bit above it, and at some point in the next several years, we’ll be back up here.<p>And once we’re there, what will we do? Well, we’re in a Trading Range, and if the market goes up, you then expect it to go down. When it goes down, you expect it to go up. So bears will sell up here and bulls will buy down here.<h3>Testing Measuring Gap</h3><p>Obviously testing a gap, and it’s a Measuring Gap. I don’t have it drawn in, but the height of this Trading Range led to a Measured Move down to here, and we’re testing the top of that gap. We closed it over here. We might get some profit-taking. As I said, we may come all the way down here. I don’t think that we will; I think we may go down a little bit, maybe sideways, and it could be sideways for many months. But this is where the market is headed.<p>So, sideways or down a little bit and then we’ll go up there. Maybe higher. I think we’ll probably go up here at some point in the next few years. This will probably remain the low for many, many years, maybe decades. If the market were to drop below that low, I think traders would buy it aggressively, betting that the market would do this again. There’s not much room between this low and zero. Crude oil is always going to have some value, at least for many, many decades. There’s going to be a demand for it.<h3>In a bull trend</h3><p>We’re currently in a bull trend – a big bull trend. We went from basically zero to $50 over the course of 6 months, and that obviously is a very strong rally. But it’s probably a bull leg in a Trading Range, and the top of the range is probably around this Sell Climax high and somewhere not far above the bear channel, bear trend line.<p>As I said, in a Trading Range the bulls will look to buy low, maybe a test of the buy signal bar. What happened when the market was at this price? Well, traders bought. We went up. So the market might want to test that price to see if the bulls will buy again. The buy zone is probably somewhere below this Higher Low and somewhere down to here, possibly all the way down to the buy signal bar low. And where’s the sell zone? I’ve been talking about it. The top of that 6-year Trading Range, which is around the top of this Sell Climax and somewhere above this.<h2>Concluding comments</h2><p>So right now we’re trending up. If we come down here, we’ll go up. We should get above this and up to this area at some point in the next couple of years, and when we do, we may go sideways, but at some point we’ll go down before we go much above.<p>And those are my thoughts about the monthly and weekly charts of crude oil for 2021 and beyond.<h3>Close</h3><p>Again, I’m Al Brooks. Thank you so much for your attention. I hope that you found some of this information useful. I want to wish you the best for the coming year as a trader, and I also want to wish you and your family a very wonderful 2021.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"></div></article>"

Yesterday’s close will probably be tested several times over the next couple years. For example, the close of President Trump’s 1st day was tested in his 2nd and 4th years.<p>What is more important for Biden, the close of the 19th or 20th? It probably is different for different firms. I usually pay attention to the close of the 20th.<p>There is a magnet above at the measured move target of 3875.75, based on the September 24/October 30 double bottom. However, the day after a strong bull trend day has only a 25% chance of being another strong bull trend. If today is a bull trend day, it will probably be weaker, like a Trending Trading Range Day or a Broad Bull Channel.<p>Since yesterday’s rally was climactic, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading, beginning by the end of the 2nd hour.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. The final 3 hours yesterday, and the Globex session, have been testing the 3850 Big Round Number.<p>Buy climaxes like yesterday typically attract profit takers. Traders often refer to it as exhaustion, or an exhaustive buy climax. Most climaxes lead to trading ranges and not trend reversals. Consequently, day traders will look for a trading range today. That means at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>The 2-month bull channel on the daily chart has had many reversals after big trend days up and down. There is therefore a slightly higher probability of a big bear day today. But day traders are expecting a lot of trading range price action today. They will switch to trend trading if there is a strong series of trend bars in either direction.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-21.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-double-bottom-at-bottom-of-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-21-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double bottom at bottom of trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been in a trading range for 2 months. Trading ranges can last a long time. Most breakout attempts fail.<p>The EURUSD has been reversing up for several days after testing the bottom. This 3-day rally is a test of the January 13 lower high. If the bulls can break strongly above it, traders will expect another attempt to break above the top of the range.<p>The bears will try to form a double top with that high. If the EURUSD reverses down from there, traders would look for another test of the bottom of the range. The rally would be a lower high major trend reversal, and the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top. That would be a sell setup.<p>While that sounds great for the bears, there is only a 40% chance that any major trend reversal will actually lead to a major trend reversal. The bears would still need consecutive closes below the bottom of the range (the January 1 low) before traders will conclude that the trading range had broken out into a bear trend.<p>While a trading range is neutral, the probability fluctuates a little within it. It depends on the strength of the legs up and down, and on the ever-changing patterns.<p>There is currently better than a 50% chance that the bears will win. However, if this 3-day rally breaks strongly above the January 13 high, the odds will shift to being slightly in favor of the bulls. What happens around that January 13 high over the next week will be important. It will give traders a clue about what to expect over the next couple weeks and maybe over the next couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight. It is now above yesterday’s high. Traders expect a test of the January 13 lower high over the next few days.<p>The overnight rally has been in a bull channel. That is a weak trend. It usually evolves into a trading range. But until there is a 20-pip pullback, day traders will focus on buying. Once it transforms into a trading range, day traders will also sell for scalps.<p>Can today accelerate up and break above the January 13 lower high? Probably not. The 3-day rally has had a lot of overlap on the daily chart. It looks more like a weak leg up in the 2-month trading range on the daily chart, rather than the start of a bull trend.<p>What about a reversal down today? It is trading just above yesterday’s high, and yesterday was a bear day on the daily chart. That is not a good buy signal bar. It could reverse down, but traders really want to see what will happen at the January 13 high. Therefore, if today reverses down, it will probably be minor. There is still about 50 pips of room left to that magnet above, and the EURUSD will probably get there within a few days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-trading-range-day-with-wedge-tops-and-bottoms.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-21-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It had a couple legs up and down, and it closed just below the open. Since it was not a strong bear bar on the daily chart, it was a reasonable follow-through bar for the bulls. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. This is especially true in the final hour. With this week being a big bull bar at a new all-time high, the bulls would like the week to close on its high. The bears would like it to close below last week’s high, but that is more than 30 points below today’s close and it might be out of reach tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is also a weak sell signal bar, and it therefore increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week. Emini near measured move target at 3875.75 based on the September/October double bottom. The Emini might have to get there before the bears will attempt a reversal down.<p>Because today is Friday, there is an increased chance of a big move in either direction in the final hour. This week has been very strong. The bulls want the week to close on its high, at a new all-time high, and at the measured move target. The bears would like today to reverse down, and close below last week’s high. Both targets are 30 points away, which might be too far for today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 27 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap below yesterday’s low. That would trigger a sell signal for a reversal down from the top of the channel on the daily chart.<p>But there have been many reversals down over the past 2 months, and the bulls bought every one within a few days. They will continue to do that until there are consecutive big down days on the daily chart.<p>If today’s gap down is small, it will probably close within the 1st hour. The bulls would like a rally to close the gap and then continue to above yesterday’s high. Today would then be an outside up day, and the week would close at a new all-time high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>If the gap down is 10 or more points, the bears would have an increased chance of a bear trend day today. It could even reverse all of Wednesday’s rally.<p>What is most likely? After a day and a half of sideways trading, traders expect more sideways trading. But because the Emini is in a buy climax, and with Emini near measured move target, traders know that there could be a big trend in either direction. If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the first hour, day traders will look for a trend day. However, if the day begins with lots of small reversals, and many bars with big tails, like yesterday, they will expect another trading range day.<p>Because today is Friday, there is an increased chance of a big move in either direction in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-trading-range-day-with-wedge-tops-and-bottoms.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-22.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with wedge tops and bottoms.

The bulls hope that this is the resumption of the 10-month bull trend. But so far, the rally lacks consecutive strong bull trend bars. It looks more like another small leg in the range. The bulls need a strong break above the January 13 high, and then above the top of the range, before traders will conclude that the bull trend is resuming.<p>Trading ranges are neutral, but there are times when they are slightly more bullish or bearish. At the moment, this trading range is slightly more bearish. But a couple strong bull days would shift the probabilities in favor of the bulls.<p>The bears want a lower high. If today closes near its low, it would be a sell signal bar for a lower high major trend reversal. There would also be a head and shoulders top. However, the January 13 high is an important magnet, and there is still room to that target. Consequently, there might be one more brief push up next week, before the bears try to break below the bottom of the trading range. If the bears succeed, they will look for a measured move down to the November 4 low at 1.16.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight on the 5-minute chart and then reversed down. The range has been small and there have been many reversals. Day traders have been scalping up and down for 10 pips.<p>The bulls want the day and week to close near the high of the day. That will increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>The bears need more than the day closing on the low. They need it to close at least 20 pips below the open so that today will be a strong sell signal bar for next week.<p>With today’s range being small and with room to the January 13 high above, the EURUSD will probably go at least a little higher next week. That reduces the chance that it will trend down strongly to far below the open of the day. Today more likely will remain sideways. Then, next week, traders will decide if the EURUSD has to get closer to the January 13 high before again testing the bottom of the 2-month trading range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-double-bottom-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-22-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It is also a weak sell signal bar, and it therefore increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week. Emini near measured move target at 3875.75 based on the September/October double bottom. The Emini might have to get there before the bears will attempt a reversal down.<p>Because today is Friday, there is an increased chance of a big move in either direction in the final hour. This week has been very strong. The bulls want the week to close on its high, at a new all-time high, and at the measured move target. The bears would like today to reverse down, and close below last week’s high. Both targets are 30 points away, which might be too far for today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 27 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap below yesterday’s low. That would trigger a sell signal for a reversal down from the top of the channel on the daily chart.<p>But there have been many reversals down over the past 2 months, and the bulls bought every one within a few days. They will continue to do that until there are consecutive big down days on the daily chart.<p>If today’s gap down is small, it will probably close within the 1st hour. The bulls would like a rally to close the gap and then continue to above yesterday’s high. Today would then be an outside up day, and the week would close at a new all-time high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>If the gap down is 10 or more points, the bears would have an increased chance of a bear trend day today. It could even reverse all of Wednesday’s rally.<p>What is most likely? After a day and a half of sideways trading, traders expect more sideways trading. But because the Emini is in a buy climax, and with Emini near measured move target, traders know that there could be a big trend in either direction. If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the first hour, day traders will look for a trend day. However, if the day begins with lots of small reversals, and many bars with big tails, like yesterday, they will expect another trading range day.<p>Because today is Friday, there is an increased chance of a big move in either direction in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-trading-range-day-with-wedge-tops-and-bottoms.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-22.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with wedge tops and bottoms.

The bulls hope that this is the resumption of the 10-month bull trend. But so far, the rally lacks consecutive strong bull trend bars. It looks more like another small leg in the range. The bulls need a strong break above the January 13 high, and then above the top of the range, before traders will conclude that the bull trend is resuming.<p>Trading ranges are neutral, but there are times when they are slightly more bullish or bearish. At the moment, this trading range is slightly more bearish. But a couple strong bull days would shift the probabilities in favor of the bulls.<p>The bears want a lower high. If today closes near its low, it would be a sell signal bar for a lower high major trend reversal. There would also be a head and shoulders top. However, the January 13 high is an important magnet, and there is still room to that target. Consequently, there might be one more brief push up next week, before the bears try to break below the bottom of the trading range.

Traders are deciding if the wedge top will lead to a test of the November 4 low at around 1.16, or if the bull trend will continue up to the 2018 high at 1.2555. Despite the strong bull trend, the odds still slightly favor more of a reversal down from the wedge.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h3 id=\"2-bond-futures-on-weekly-chart-are-pausing-after-break-below-the-2020-trading-range\">Bond futures on<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart are pausing after break below the 2020 trading range</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-breakout-below-triangle-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-23.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has weak breakout below triangle trading range\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures formed an inside bar this week. I said that last week’s bull doji after the bear breakout could lead to a week or more of sideways trading. The bears wanted a big bear after after the break below the 2020 trading range. The bulls wanted a strong bull bar as a sign that the breakout was failing. Instead, we got a neutral bar. When that happens, traders need more information, which typically means one or more additional sideways bars.<p>Because this week was a bear inside bar after the bear breakout, it is a Low 1 bear flag sell signal bar. I have been saying for a year that bonds will go down for a decade or more. But I have also said that there will be rallies along the way that could last many months or even a year.<p>The point is that the bond market can rally strongly even when it is in a bear trend. That is what is causing the hesitation now. The bears are not quite as confident as they would like to be. They are concerned that the market has gone sideways after the breakout instead of strongly down. That increases the chance that the breakout still could fail. The bears could suddenly give up and aggressively buy their shorts. That could lead to a reversal up<p>I said that the sell setup is not strong. But the buy setup is even worse. Most traders do not want to buy above a bear bar just after a bear breakout. This is because they know that there will probably be more sellers than buyers above this week’s high. They expect that a reversal attempt will fail and the bear trend will resume.<p>However, if next week is a big bull bar closing back above the June low, the bulls will begin to believe that the bear breakout failed. If there are a couple consecutive big bull bars, traders will look for a move up to the August high over the next few months.<p>That is “if.” It is still more likely that the breakout will succeed, but the bonds might have to go sideways a little longer for traders to conclude that the reversal attempt was failing. If they do, they will sell, and bonds will have another leg down.<h2 id=\"3-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h3 id=\"4-eurusd-on-monthly-chart-is-testing-the-2018-lower-high\">EURUSD on<em><strong>monthly</strong></em>chart is testing the 2018 lower high</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-rally-to-top-of-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-23-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has wedge rally to top of trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market has rallied for 10 months on the monthly chart. The bulls want the rally to continue to above the February 2018 high. That was the top of the most recent leg up in a 12-year bear trend.<p>So far, January is a bear doji bar, which is fairly neutral. But if the month ends up with a bull body, traders will expect sideways to up trading in February. A bear body would increase the chance of sideways to down trading.<p>A bear trend has a series of lower highs. The trend on the monthly chart is still down as long as the lower high holds. But if this rally breaks strongly above that lower high, traders will conclude that the bear trend on the monthly chart has ended.<p>It is a mistake to assume that the EURUSD going above that high will mean that the monthly chart is in a bull trend. Remember, the monthly chart has been in a trading range for 6 years. That February 2018 high is the top of the range. Failed breakouts above and below trading ranges are common. The bulls need a couple monthly closes above that high to make traders believe that the breakout will be successful, and that the EURUSD is in a bull trend.<p>If they get their breakout, traders will say that the bull trend begun at the 2017 low. If there is instead a strong reversal down, traders will conclude that the 6-year trading range is still in effect, and that the 10-year bear trend might be resuming.<p>What is more likely, a 6-year pause in a 12-year bear trend or the start of a bull trend? The selloff down to the March 2020 low was not as strong as either the rally to the 2018 high or the 2020 rally. Also, the 2020 low stayed above the 2017 low and it could be the 1st higher low in a new bull trend. These factors make it more likely that the monthly chart is in the early stage of a bull trend. But the bulls need a strong break above that 2018 high. Otherwise, it is still in its 6-year trading range.<h3 id=\"5-eurusd-on-weekly-chart-formed-a-high-1-buy-signal-bar-this-week\">EURUSD on<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart formed a High 1 buy signal bar this week</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-high-1-bull-flag-after-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-23-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has high 1 bull flag after wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart reversed up strongly this week after last week’s reversal down. This week was a bull bar that closed near its high. It is a High 1 buy signal bar for a pullback in the bull trend that began in March. The bulls hope that next week will break strongly above, and then continue up to above the 2018 high.<p>However, the weekly chart has been sideways for 6 weeks. Buying at the top of a tight trading range has a lower probability of success.<p>More importantly, the EURUSD turned down 2 weeks ago from a wedge top. It is important to note that even though the EURUSD reversed down twice in the past 4 weeks, neither sell signal bar was a strong bear bar. That reduces the chance that the reversal will be successful.<p>Additionally, that wedge formed a lower high double top with the 2018 high. The sell signal is still in effect unless the EURUSD breaks above the top of the wedge.<p>And even if it does, half of breakouts above wedge tops fail, and the market then reverses down a second time. With that in mind, even with this week being a buy signal, it is still slightly more likely that the EURUSD will reverse down, than successfully break to the upside. However, it would only take a couple strong bull bars to flip the odds in favor of the bulls.<p>If the bulls get their breakout above the January high, but then the EURUSD reverses down again, traders would redraw the wedge. They would conclude that the summer rally was so strong that the leg count started over. The September 1 high would be the new 1st leg up, and the January 6 high would be the 2nd. The breakout above that high would then be the 3rd.<p>For the bears, they want the reversal down from the wedge top to test the most recent higher low. That is the November 4 low of 1.1603. However, they have not been able to create consecutive strong bear bars since March. A lack of sustained selling is a sign of a strong bull trend. Even if the bears get a reversal down to 1.16 over the next couple months, traders will buy it. The odds currently favor an eventual break above the 2018 high of 1.2555.<h2 id=\"6-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h3 id=\"7-emini-on-monthly-chart-is-forming-its-3rd-consecutive-strong-bull-bar\">Emini on<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart is forming its 3rd consecutive strong bull bar</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SP500-Emini-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-is-breaking-above-bull-channels.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-23-3.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini futures monthly candlestick chart is breaking above bull channels\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is forming its 3rd consecutive bull bar closing on its high. It is coming in a very strong rally from the March low, and this is occurring in a 10-year bull trend. If this month closes on its high, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in February.<p>But what about the 2 bear bars in September and October? They formed a High 1 bull flag, but a break above bear bars late in a bull trend usually fails within a couple bars. This is now the 3rd bar and there is no sign of failure.<p>There is still time for the Emini to trade back to below the open of the month, by the end of the month. But unless the month closes well below the open, the month will only be neutral and not bearish. However, if there is a sharp reversal down to near the low of the month, traders will expect lower prices in February.<p>The bears currently have only a 20% chance of achieving that objective. More likely, the best they can hope to get is a close around the middle of the month. That would make February more likely to be sideways instead of down.<h3 id=\"8-sampp500-emini-futures-market-weekly-chart-just-below-measured-move-target-from-septemberoctober-double-bottom\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures market<em><strong>weekly</strong></em>chart just below measured move target from September/October double bottom</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SP500-Emini-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-tight-bull-channel-nead-measured-move-target-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-23-4.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini rallying strongly. Weekly chart in tight bull channel near measured move target\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since the March pandemic low. The rally since the November 9 bear bar has been in a very tight bull channel.<p>However, the Emini has gone sideways for several bars 3 times in the current rally. This is the 3rd leg up from the March low, and it is slightly weaker than the 1st two. But there is no sign of a top, and therefore traders continue to bet on at least slightly higher prices.<p>The Emini this week poked above the top of the channel created by the May 1, 2019 and February 19, 2020 highs. However, the September/October double bottom has a measured move target at 3875.75. That is a magnet and it is just above this week’s high. The Emini might have to get there before there is more than a 2-week pullback.<p>The bulls want the rally to break above the 4,000 Big Round Number before there is more than a 2-week pullback. However, the buy climax is already extended. There will therefore probably be a pullback before the rally reaches that target.<p>And even once there is a reversal down, the 1st selloff from a tight bull channel typically is minor. That means it would more likely lead to a trading range, like in September and October, than a bear trend. Bulls will buy the selloff.<h3 id=\"9-sampp500-emini-futures-market-daily-chart-is-testing-top-of-bull-channel\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures market<em><strong>daily</strong></em>chart is testing top of bull channel</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SP500-Emini-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-in-spike-and-channel-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-23-5.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini futures daily candlestick chart in spike and channel bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is in a Spike and Channel bull trend. The breakout up to the November 9 high was the spike, and the channel began with the November 10 pullback.<p>Bull channels usually transition into trading ranges soon after they last 50 bars. The current rally has gone on about that long. Also, this week is testing the top of the channel. Most attempts to break above a bull channel fail within 5 bars of breaking out. Therefore, the current rally should end next week or in early February.<p>But will a reversal down break below the bottom of the channel? While it typically retraces down so the start of the channel, which is the November 10 low at around 3500, it sometimes simply goes sideways for 20 or more bars, and then the bull trend resumes.<p>There is always a bull case. The obvious one is that traders have bought every 2- to 3-day reversal for 3 months. Traders therefore know that another new high is always more likely that a correction.<p>Also, while most attempts to break above a bull channel fail, they succeed 25% of the time. Success means a strong breakout and an acceleration of the bull trend. This means that the market cycle starts over. At some point, there will be a pullback. That would convert the breakout phase into another bull channel, which is a weaker bull trend. Then, the market would likely break below the bull trend line. The bull trend should then evolve into a trading range.<p>What is likely next week? It is always better to bet on higher prices when a market is in a bull trend. But the channel has lasted a long time and the Emini is at the top of the channel. These factors make a swing down likely to begin soon.<h2 id=\"10-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Because it had a bull body, it is a High 1 late in bull channel buy signal bar. But Friday had a prominent tail on top, and the Emini is at the top of channels on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. This makes it a weaker buy signal, and it increases the chance of more sideways trading again today.<p>The bull channel has lasted more than 50 bars on the daily chart, which is a long time. That increases the chance of a break below the bull trend line and then a transition into a trading range. However, traders keep buying pullbacks, and they keep getting new highs. They will continue to buy until there is a credible top, or a surprisingly big reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 1 point in the Globex session. It will probably open within the middle of yesterday’s range. Yesterday (Friday) was a trading range day, as were most days over the past 2 weeks. That increases the change of another trading range day today.<p>This is the final week of January. Traders are starting to think about how January will look on the monthly chart. Everyone knows that the bull trend has been extremely strong on the weekly and monthly charts. That makes traders wary of a possible profit taking selloff coming at any time.<p>However, with most recent days having both at least one swing up and one swing down, traders will expect another mostly sideways day today. But if there is an early series of strong trend bars in either direction, they will look for a possible trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-double-bottom-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-25.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and then trading range.

A trading range always has both a credible buy and sell setup. The bulls want the 5-day rally to be a resumption of the bull trend. However, the rally lacks consecutive strong bull bars. It looks more like another leg in the trading range instead of the start of a bull trend.<p>The bears see the rally as a pullback from the selloff from the January high. They expect it to soon fail, and for another move down to begin. The lower high could be the start of a major trend reversal. It would be the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top.<p>In a trading range, it is easy to only see one argument. But it is important to understand that a market can only be in a trading range if the bulls and bears are equally strong. They simply take turns at attempts to create a trend. Most attempts fail.<p>While the current setup is slightly better for the bears, until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. The bears need big bear bars, consecutive big bear bars, and consecutive closes below the January 1 low, which is the bottom of the range. If they get that, traders will look for a measured move down to the November 4 low at 1.16. Until then, traders will continue to take quick profits every few days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off sharply to below Friday’s low. Friday is a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a head and shoulders top. However, it had a bull body and Thursday was a big bull bar. This lowers the chance that today will be the start of a bear trend down to 1.16. As I said, most breakout attempts within a trading range fail.<p>There was a 25 pip bounce a couple hours ago. It was strong enough so that bears will consider buying a reversal up from a test of the overnight low. They hope that the remainder of the day is sideways instead of down.<p>The selloff was strong enough to make a trend reversal back up unlikely. Therefore, the bears will sell rallies.<p>Because the bounce was strong, there is a Big Down, Big Up, Big Confusion pattern. That makes a trading range most likely, at least for a couple hours. However, if there is going to be a trend from here, down is more likely than up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-outside-up-day-after-sell-climax-and-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day after sell climax and outside down day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It collapsed to below Friday’s low, making today an outside down day. It reversed up strongly from a sell climax and a measured move down, based on Friday’s range. It got back above Friday’s high at the end of the day, making today an outside up day after starting out as an outside down day.<p>Today could not get back above the early high and it closed just above the open. It was a bull doji day, which is only slightly bullish.<p>Today’s high is just below the all-time high. The bulls have been continually making new highs for a couple months, and are trying again. They will probably succeed tomorrow.<p>It is important to note that the bull channel on the daily chart has lasted more than 50 bars, which is unusual. That increases the chance of a break below the channel coming soon.<p>This is the final week of January, and there is plenty of time remaining for a reversal down, especially with an FOMC meeting on Wednesday. If the bears get a selloff later this week, it would increase the chance of lower prices in February.<p>But the Emini is in a strong bull trend on all higher time frames. Traders have been buying every 1- to 3- day selloff for 3 months. They will continue to do this until it no longer works.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It looks more like another leg in the trading range instead of the start of a bull trend.<p>The bears see the rally as a pullback from the selloff from the January high. They expect it to soon fail, and for another move down to begin. The lower high could be the start of a major trend reversal. It would be the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top.<p>In a trading range, it is easy to only see one argument. But it is important to understand that a market can only be in a trading range if the bulls and bears are equally strong. They simply take turns at attempts to create a trend. Most attempts fail.<p>While the current setup is slightly better for the bears, until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. The bears need big bear bars, consecutive big bear bars, and consecutive closes below the January 1 low, which is the bottom of the range. If they get that, traders will look for a measured move down to the November 4 low at 1.16. Until then, traders will continue to take quick profits every few days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off sharply to below Friday’s low. Friday is a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a head and shoulders top. However, it had a bull body and Thursday was a big bull bar. This lowers the chance that today will be the start of a bear trend down to 1.16. As I said, most breakout attempts within a trading range fail.<p>There was a 25 pip bounce a couple hours ago. It was strong enough so that bears will consider buying a reversal up from a test of the overnight low. They hope that the remainder of the day is sideways instead of down.<p>The selloff was strong enough to make a trend reversal back up unlikely. Therefore, the bears will sell rallies.<p>Because the bounce was strong, there is a Big Down, Big Up, Big Confusion pattern. That makes a trading range most likely, at least for a couple hours. However, if there is going to be a trend from here, down is more likely than up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-outside-up-day-after-sell-climax-and-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day after sell climax and outside down day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It collapsed to below Friday’s low, making today an outside down day. It reversed up strongly from a sell climax and a measured move down, based on Friday’s range. It got back above Friday’s high at the end of the day, making today an outside up day after starting out as an outside down day.<p>Today could not get back above the early high and it closed just above the open. It was a bull doji day, which is only slightly bullish.<p>Today’s high is just below the all-time high. The bulls have been continually making new highs for a couple months, and are trying again. They will probably succeed tomorrow.<p>It is important to note that the bull channel on the daily chart has lasted more than 50 bars, which is unusual. That increases the chance of a break below the channel coming soon.<p>This is the final week of January, and there is plenty of time remaining for a reversal down, especially with an FOMC meeting on Wednesday. If the bears get a selloff later this week, it would increase the chance of lower prices in February.<p>But the Emini is in a strong bull trend on all higher time frames. Traders have been buying every 1- to 3- day selloff for 3 months. They will continue to do this until it no longer works.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Because it had a bull body, it is a High 1 late in bull channel buy signal bar. But Friday had a prominent tail on top, and the Emini is at the top of channels on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. This makes it a weaker buy signal, and it increases the chance of more sideways trading again today.<p>The bull channel has lasted more than 50 bars on the daily chart, which is a long time. That increases the chance of a break below the bull trend line and then a transition into a trading range. However, traders keep buying pullbacks, and they keep getting new highs. They will continue to buy until there is a credible top, or a surprisingly big reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 1 point in the Globex session. It will probably open within the middle of yesterday’s range. Yesterday (Friday) was a trading range day, as were most days over the past 2 weeks. That increases the change of another trading range day today.<p>This is the final week of January. Traders are starting to think about how January will look on the monthly chart. Everyone knows that the bull trend has been extremely strong on the weekly and monthly charts. That makes traders wary of a possible profit taking selloff coming at any time.<p>However, with most recent days having both at least one swing up and one swing down, traders will expect another mostly sideways day today. But if there is an early series of strong trend bars in either direction, they will look for a possible trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-double-bottom-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-25.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and then trading range.

The bull trend is strong on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. Traders will continue to buy every 1- to 3-day selloff until there are consecutive big bear days. Then, traders will look for a couple legs sideways to down over the following few weeks.<p>This is the final week of the month. The bulls want a 3rd consecutive bull bar closing near its high on the monthly chart. That would make higher prices likely in February.<p>However, the bears will try to get the month to close below the open. That would make traders expect a sideways to down February. At the moment, the open of the month is far below, and therefore it is unlikely that January will close below the open. If this month were to close near its low, the bears expect a selloff in February.<p>What is likely today? The Emini has been sideways for 4 days. That increases the chance of more sideways trading today. However, the bulls keep getting new highs, and yesterday was a bull reversal day. Therefore, the odds favor another new all-time high today or tomorrow.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 9 points in the Globex session. It might gap up to a new all-time high. If it does, the gap will be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>The bulls want a continuation of their strong rally from yesterday. Additionally, the 4 sideways days in a bull trend is a bull flag. Today is trying to break above the bull flag. A breakout in a bull trend after several sideways days has an increased chance of leading to a bull trend day. But if the Emini reverses down early, it will probably continue the 4-day trading range.<p>Despite the strong 3-month rally, most days have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Traders will look for that again today, especially with an FOMC report tomorrow.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-outside-up-day-after-sell-climax-and-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-26.png\" alt=\"Emini outside bar, outside up day after sell climax and outside down day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is Breakout Mode.<p>The bulls hope that the trading range is a bull flag. They want a breakout above, and then a rally to above the February 2018 high of 1.2555.<p>However, the bears want a lower high, and then a breakout below. They would look for a measured move down to the November 4 low at 1.16. The January 22 lower high had a bull body, which is a weak sell signal bar, and the 2-day selloff has been weak. This is not yet a credible lower high major trend reversal (here, it would also be the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top).<p>The EURUSD is still balanced. There is a 50% chance that the successful breakout will be up, and a 50% chance it will be down. Until there are consecutive closes above or below the range, traders will continue to look for reversals.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to below yesterday’s low, but then reversed up to above the open. Both the selloff and rally were unimpressive. They look like legs in a trading range day. Day traders have only been buying since the reversal up. The bulls want today to go above yesterday’s high. It would then be an outside up day, which would increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow.<p>The rally had an initial spike, but has been in a wedge bull channel for several hours. A wedge rally usually transitions into a trading range.<p>If that happens today, day traders will begin to sell reversals down for scalps. A reversal back down to the low is unlikely. Consequently, bull day traders will continue to buy all day. But if the day evolves into a trading range, which it probably will, the bulls will wait to buy pullbacks instead of buying breakouts.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-Low-2-top-then-midday-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 top then midday bull trend reversal from wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Because it had a bear body, it is a sell signal bar for tomorrow. However, with the daily chart in a Small Pullback Bull Trend, traders have been buying below the low of the prior day and every 1- to 3-day pullback. This is therefore a weak sell setup.<p>There is an FOMC announcement at 11 am PST tomorrow.

The bull trend is strong on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. Traders will continue to buy every 1- to 3-day selloff until there are consecutive big bear days. Then, traders will look for a couple legs sideways to down over the following few weeks.<p>This is the final week of the month. The bulls want a 3rd consecutive bull bar closing near its high on the monthly chart. That would make higher prices likely in February.<p>However, the bears will try to get the month to close below the open. That would make traders expect a sideways to down February. At the moment, the open of the month is far below, and therefore it is unlikely that January will close below the open. If this month were to close near its low, the bears expect a selloff in February.<p>What is likely today? The Emini has been sideways for 4 days. That increases the chance of more sideways trading today. However, the bulls keep getting new highs, and yesterday was a bull reversal day. Therefore, the odds favor another new all-time high today or tomorrow.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 9 points in the Globex session. It might gap up to a new all-time high. If it does, the gap will be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>The bulls want a continuation of their strong rally from yesterday. Additionally, the 4 sideways days in a bull trend is a bull flag. Today is trying to break above the bull flag. A breakout in a bull trend after several sideways days has an increased chance of leading to a bull trend day. But if the Emini reverses down early, it will probably continue the 4-day trading range.<p>Despite the strong 3-month rally, most days have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Traders will look for that again today, especially with an FOMC report tomorrow.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-outside-up-day-after-sell-climax-and-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-26.png\" alt=\"Emini outside bar, outside up day after sell climax and outside down day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But yesterday was a small bar on the daily chart, and it had a bear body.

If the Emini simply goes sideways for the remainder of the week, they will have achieved their goal. Traders would then expect higher prices in February.<p>The bears want to undo some of the bullishness. They would like the month to close in the middle of its range, and preferably below the open. Traders would then look for sideways to down trading in February.<p>There is a FOMC announcement today at 11:00 pm PST. It can be a catalyst for a big move in either direction. This will be the first FOMC meeting with Biden as president. However, the Fed many months ago said it was not planning any changes in its policy for at least a couple years.

However, day traders should exit their positions ahead of the FOMC report. There is usually a fast move up and down after the report.

It will therefore break far below yesterday’s low, which will trigger the sell signal on the daily chart. It will also be far below the open of the week. Remember, the bears want a bear bar on the weekly chart.<p>Also, markets often change the appearance of bars just before they close. So far, January has been a big bull bar on the monthly chart. Therefore, there is an increased chance that the Emini could sell off down to the open of the month by the end of this week.<p>Because the buy climax on the daily chart is extreme, there is an increased chance of big bear days coming at any time. When there is a big gap down, there is an increased chance of a trend day up or down. But if there is a trend, down is more likely.<p>Will today have both a swing up and a swing down today, like most days in January? We’ll see.

While the probability currently is slightly greater for the bears, a single big bull bar could flip it back in favor of the bulls.<p>There is a FOMC report today at 11 am PST, which can affect all financial markets. Day traders should exit their positions ahead of the report, and wait at least 10 minutes before resuming trading.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off in a tight bear channel overnight. Yesterday was a buy signal bar on the daily chart, yet today is breaking below the low of the bar, instead of above the top.<p>The bears hope that this is a resumption of the bear trend that began on January 6. If it is, there will many, many bear trend days over the next couple weeks.<p>The overnight selling has been in a tight bear channel. Day traders have only been selling.<p>All financial markets typically enter a trading range an hour or more before the 11 am PST FOMC announcement. If there is a trading range ahead of the report, day traders will look to buy reversals up from the bottom, in addition to continuing to sell.<p>Can today reverse up into a bull trend? When a selloff has been relentless like this, the bulls only have a 30% chance. There is a 70% chance that today will be sideways to down all day. However, since the FOMC can be a catalyst for a big move up or down, traders will look for a possible reversal up after the report, even though it is unlikely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-triangle-and-then-bear-trend-after-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle and then bear trend after FOMC announcement\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then sold off to below the open of the month. It closed at the bottom of its 3-month bull channel and it broke far below the 3-week bull trend line. At the moment, it is more likely than not that a 1-% correction down to 3500 has begun. But if tomorrow is a strong bull day, then traders will wonder if there will be another new high before there is a correction.<p>I have been saying for several weeks that this month’s open could be important at the end of the month. The bulls want a 3rd consecutive bull bar on the monthly chart and the bears want a bear bar. The Emini might oscillate around the open of the month through the end of the month on Friday. However, unless there is a strong reversal up in the next few days, traders will expect lower prices.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But yesterday was a small bar on the daily chart, and it had a bear body. It is therefore a sell signal bar for today.<p>While the risk of a 10% correction is growing with the bull channel on the daily chart lasting a long time, traders will keep buying every 1- to 3- day pullback until there are consecutive big bear days. Then, they will look for a 2nd leg down and a 10% correction over 2- to 3- weeks.<p>The bulls want January to be the 3rd consecutive bull bar closing on its high on the monthly chart. If the Emini simply goes sideways for the remainder of the week, they will have achieved their goal. Traders would then expect higher prices in February.<p>The bears want to undo some of the bullishness. They would like the month to close in the middle of its range, and preferably below the open. Traders would then look for sideways to down trading in February.<p>There is a FOMC announcement today at 11:00 pm PST. It can be a catalyst for a big move in either direction. This will be the first FOMC meeting with Biden as president. However, the Fed many months ago said it was not planning any changes in its policy for at least a couple years. That reduces the chance of any surprises, and of a big trend after the report.<p>With most days over the past two months having at least one swing up and one swing down, traders will expect that again today. However, day traders should exit their positions ahead of the FOMC report. There is usually a fast move up and down after the report. Traders should wait at least 10 minutes to see if a trend might be starting.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 42 points in the Globex session. It will therefore break far below yesterday’s low, which will trigger the sell signal on the daily chart. It will also be far below the open of the week. Remember, the bears want a bear bar on the weekly chart.<p>Also, markets often change the appearance of bars just before they close. So far, January has been a big bull bar on the monthly chart. Therefore, there is an increased chance that the Emini could sell off down to the open of the month by the end of this week.<p>Because the buy climax on the daily chart is extreme, there is an increased chance of big bear days coming at any time. When there is a big gap down, there is an increased chance of a trend day up or down. But if there is a trend, down is more likely.<p>Will today have both a swing up and a swing down today, like most days in January? We’ll see. If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down on the open, today will more likely be a trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-Low-2-top-then-midday-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-27.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 top then midday bull trend reversal from wedge bottom.

The Emini formed a big bear day yesterday on the daily chart. It poked just below the bottom of the 3-month bull channel and the 50-day MA, and fell below the open of January and close of 2020.<p>More importantly, it broke far below the 3-week bull trend line, and far below the bull trend line drawn from the January 4 to January 15 lows. This was the biggest break below any bull trend line since the bull channel began on November 10. It therefore represents a significant change in behavior.<p>If today is a 2nd consecutive big bear day, traders will conclude that the Emini is finally transitioning from a bull channel into a trading range. The bottom of the range might be at the start of the bull channel. That is the November 10 low at around 3500, which is about a 10% correction.<p>There have been many big bear days over the past 3 months. Each was followed by a bull day, and then by a new high. Therefore today is important. If it is a strong bull day, the odds will again favor the bulls. But if it is a bear day, the odds will favor the bears, like it did in early September and again mid-October.<p>I have been saying all month that this month’s close would be important. If it is a 3rd consecutive bull bar, traders will expect higher prices in February. If it closes in the middle, they will expect sideways to down in February. If it closes near the low, it will be a good sell signal bar on the monthly chart, and they will expect a pullback in February. The Emini might wait until the final hour on Friday to decide how January will look on the monthly chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 40+ points in the Globex session. Since yesterday was a sell climax day, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading beginning by the 2nd hour.<p>Every big bear trend day since late October has been followed by a bull day. Traders have been looking at the big bear days as buying opportunities. That makes it likely that many bulls will buy today.<p>But will they get the day to close above today’s open, like they did on the day after every other big day? If they do, traders will assume that the bull trend is intact.<p>But if today closes below the open, traders will conclude that something has changed. That would increase the chance of lower prices over the next few weeks. This is especially true if today closes far below the open. Therefore the open will be important today, which increases the chance of today oscillating around it. That would create a trading range day.<p>Tomorrow is the final trading day of the month. The open of the month will therefore be important through tomorrow’s close.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-triangle-and-then-bear-trend-after-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-28.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle and then bear trend after FOMC announcement.

This is a Breakout Mode pattern, and it is within a 2-month trading range, which is a bigger Breakout Mode pattern. Traders looking for a trend just have to wait.<p>Most traders are looking for reversals every few days, and they are taking quick profits. Everyone knows that the trading range has lasted a long time. They expect it to end soon. But until there is a clear breakout, traders will continue to look for small reversals.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways overnight and its range is small. The low is above yesterday’s low, and the high is below yesterday’s high. Today therefore so far is a small inside day. The range is so small that it has been difficult for scalpers to make even 10 pips on a trade. However, unless there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, day traders will continue to look for small reversals to scalp.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-had-midday-Higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini had midday Higher high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It broke above yesterday’s high, the 3800 Big Round Number, and the 60-minute EMA, but then went sideways for 2 hours. The Emini then sold off from a higher high major trend reversal and small Expanding Triangle top.<p>It trended down for the rest of the day and closed in the middle of the day’s range. While it was a bull bar on the daily chart and it reversed yesterday’s selloff, if closed near the open. It is back in the mid-January trading range.<p>The bulls are hoping that yesterday was a bear trap and that today was a resumption of the bull trend. However, the bears want a lower high on the daily chart, which would be a lower high major trend reversal and the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top. Today’s reversal up was strong enough to undo the bearishness of yesterday, but it was not enough to convince traders that the bull trend is resuming. Traders will watch the next few days to see if there is a strong move up or down.<p>Tomorrow if the last day of January. Monthly support and resistance could be important, especially in the final hour. The open of the month is the most important price. It January has a small bear body, it will reduce the chance of higher prices in February. If it has a big bear body, traders will look for lower prices in February.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders have been looking at the big bear days as buying opportunities. That makes it likely that many bulls will buy today.<p>But will they get the day to close above today’s open, like they did on the day after every other big day? If they do, traders will assume that the bull trend is intact.<p>But if today closes below the open, traders will conclude that something has changed. That would increase the chance of lower prices over the next few weeks. This is especially true if today closes far below the open. Therefore the open will be important today, which increases the chance of today oscillating around it. That would create a trading range day.<p>Tomorrow is the final trading day of the month. The open of the month will therefore be important through tomorrow’s close.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-triangle-and-then-bear-trend-after-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-28.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle and then bear trend after FOMC announcement.

The Emini formed a big bear day yesterday on the daily chart. It poked just below the bottom of the 3-month bull channel and the 50-day MA, and fell below the open of January and close of 2020.<p>More importantly, it broke far below the 3-week bull trend line, and far below the bull trend line drawn from the January 4 to January 15 lows. This was the biggest break below any bull trend line since the bull channel began on November 10. It therefore represents a significant change in behavior.<p>If today is a 2nd consecutive big bear day, traders will conclude that the Emini is finally transitioning from a bull channel into a trading range. The bottom of the range might be at the start of the bull channel. That is the November 10 low at around 3500, which is about a 10% correction.<p>There have been many big bear days over the past 3 months. Each was followed by a bull day, and then by a new high. Therefore today is important. If it is a strong bull day, the odds will again favor the bulls. But if it is a bear day, the odds will favor the bears, like it did in early September and again mid-October.<p>I have been saying all month that this month’s close would be important. If it is a 3rd consecutive bull bar, traders will expect higher prices in February. If it closes in the middle, they will expect sideways to down in February. If it closes near the low, it will be a good sell signal bar on the monthly chart, and they will expect a pullback in February. The Emini might wait until the final hour on Friday to decide how January will look on the monthly chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 40+ points in the Globex session.

While yesterday traded above Wednesday’s high, it closed below the middle of the range, and near the open. Big Down, Big Up, Big Down creates Big Confusion. Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range.<p>The Emini has been sideways for 3 weeks. While yesterday’s reversal up was good for the bulls, the Emini is still in a 4-week trading range. The bulls need follow-through buying today to convince traders that the bull trend is resuming. If instead it goes sideways, traders will wonder if it will reverse down from a lower high major trend reversal, and head and shoulders top.<p>The next few days will be important. If they are bull days closing near their highs, traders will expect higher prices in February. But if the Emini goes sideways for a few days and then sells off, traders will look for a test of 3,500 in February.<p>The odds always at least slightly favor a resumption of a trend, until there is a reversal with follow-through selling. Wednesday was a reversal down, but yesterday provided no follow-through selling. The bears need a couple consecutive big bear days to make traders conclude that a 10% selloff has begun. Until then, traders will bet on higher prices.<p>Today is Friday, so weekly support and resistance can be important. It is also the final trading day of January so monthly support and resistance can be important as well. This is especially true in the final hour. The bears want January to close below the open of the month. January would then have a bear body on the monthly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices in February.<p>The bulls want the month to close above the open. They would prefer it to close at the high. The more bullish the month is, the more likely that the Emini will go higher in February.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 20 points in the Globex session. This is just a couple points above the open of the month. With the big swings up and down over the past 2 days, the Emini might be forming a triangle. If so, it might be waiting for February to decide on the direction of the next trend on the daily chart. This reduces the chance of a trend day today.<p>The past 2 days had huge ranges. The range will probably be smaller, but still bigger than average. Because it has been oscillating around the open of the month for the past 2 days, and today is the last trading day of the month, the Emini might stay here all day today, and wait for the final hour to decide whether January will have a bull or bear body on the monthly chart.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-had-midday-Higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-29.png\" alt=\"Emini had midday Higher high major trend reversal.

The bulls want trend resumption up to above the January high. The bears want a breakout below. Both expect a 300-pip measured move, based on the height of the 2-month trading range.<p>When a chart is in Breakout Mode, there is a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout, and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout. The chart is slightly bullish for a few days, and then slightly bearish. But traders take quick profits because they can see that the market reverses every few days.<p>Since the EURUSD is at the bottom of the 2-month range, and yesterday had a bull body, traders expect a bounce. Yesterday was a bull inside day, and a buy signal bar for the 4-week double bottom. The EURUSD went above yesterday’s high overnight, which triggered the buy signal. But will today race up to above the January 22 high? Probably not.<p>Today is the last trading day of the week and of the month. Weekly and monthly support and resistance can be important, especially at the end of the day. So far, this week and this month have small bear bodies. The bulls want today to rally enough so that both will have bull bodies by the close.<p>However, the open of the week and the open of the month, are probably too far above for the bulls to achieve their goals. But if the bear bodies remain small, which is likely, they only slightly increase the chance of lower prices next week. The chart will still be relatively neutral.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off and then reversed up overnight, but the range is small. So far, this is not the start of a strong bull trend.<p>However, by going above yesterday’s high, the EURUSD triggered a minor buy signal on the daily chart. If the overnight bull trend continues up to above the January 22 lower high, the bulls will look for continuation up next week. But with the EURUSD being in a small trading range for 4 weeks, today will probably not be a big bull day.<p>Since the overnight rally has been in a tight bull channel, day traders have only been buying. They will probably look to buy all day today. But a weak rally typically converts into a trading range.<p>Once there is a 20- to 30-pip pullback, traders will conclude that the bull trend evolved into a trading range. At that point, day traders will also look to sell. Since a strong reversal down is unlikely after the reversal up, the bears will only scalp. If the chart evolves into a trading range, the bulls will switch to buying 20-pip pullbacks, instead of buying High 1 and High 2 bull flags near the high.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-wedge-rally-to-double-top-then-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge rally to double top then bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If they are bull days closing near their highs, traders will expect higher prices in February. But if the Emini goes sideways for a few days and then sells off, traders will look for a test of 3,500 in February.<p>The odds always at least slightly favor a resumption of a trend, until there is a reversal with follow-through selling. Wednesday was a reversal down, but yesterday provided no follow-through selling. The bears need a couple consecutive big bear days to make traders conclude that a 10% selloff has begun. Until then, traders will bet on higher prices.<p>Today is Friday, so weekly support and resistance can be important. It is also the final trading day of January so monthly support and resistance can be important as well. This is especially true in the final hour. The bears want January to close below the open of the month. January would then have a bear body on the monthly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices in February.<p>The bulls want the month to close above the open. They would prefer it to close at the high. The more bullish the month is, the more likely that the Emini will go higher in February.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 20 points in the Globex session. This is just a couple points above the open of the month. With the big swings up and down over the past 2 days, the Emini might be forming a triangle. If so, it might be waiting for February to decide on the direction of the next trend on the daily chart. This reduces the chance of a trend day today.<p>The past 2 days had huge ranges. The range will probably be smaller, but still bigger than average. Because it has been oscillating around the open of the month for the past 2 days, and today is the last trading day of the month, the Emini might stay here all day today, and wait for the final hour to decide whether January will have a bull or bear body on the monthly chart.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-had-midday-Higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-29.png\" alt=\"Emini had midday Higher high major trend reversal.

The bulls want trend resumption up to above the January high. The bears want a breakout below. Both expect a 300-pip measured move, based on the height of the 2-month trading range.<p>When a chart is in Breakout Mode, there is a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout, and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout. The chart is slightly bullish for a few days, and then slightly bearish. But traders take quick profits because they can see that the market reverses every few days.<p>Since the EURUSD is at the bottom of the 2-month range, and yesterday had a bull body, traders expect a bounce. Yesterday was a bull inside day, and a buy signal bar for the 4-week double bottom. The EURUSD went above yesterday’s high overnight, which triggered the buy signal. But will today race up to above the January 22 high? Probably not.<p>Today is the last trading day of the week and of the month. Weekly and monthly support and resistance can be important, especially at the end of the day. So far, this week and this month have small bear bodies. The bulls want today to rally enough so that both will have bull bodies by the close.<p>However, the open of the week and the open of the month, are probably too far above for the bulls to achieve their goals. But if the bear bodies remain small, which is likely, they only slightly increase the chance of lower prices next week. The chart will still be relatively neutral.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off and then reversed up overnight, but the range is small. So far, this is not the start of a strong bull trend.<p>However, by going above yesterday’s high, the EURUSD triggered a minor buy signal on the daily chart. If the overnight bull trend continues up to above the January 22 lower high, the bulls will look for continuation up next week. But with the EURUSD being in a small trading range for 4 weeks, today will probably not be a big bull day.<p>Since the overnight rally has been in a tight bull channel, day traders have only been buying. They will probably look to buy all day today. But a weak rally typically converts into a trading range.<p>Once there is a 20- to 30-pip pullback, traders will conclude that the bull trend evolved into a trading range. At that point, day traders will also look to sell. Since a strong reversal down is unlikely after the reversal up, the bears will only scalp. If the chart evolves into a trading range, the bulls will switch to buying 20-pip pullbacks, instead of buying High 1 and High 2 bull flags near the high.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-wedge-rally-to-double-top-then-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge rally to double top then bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This month broke below the June/November double bottom, which is the bottom of a 9-month trading range. More importantly, it broke below the bull trend line from the November 2018 and January 2020 lows.<p>However, January closed up from its low. The candlestick has a prominent tail below, making it slightly less bearish. Additionally, the close was only a little below the bull trend line. So, yes, the bears have a breakout, but not an impressive one yet. They need follow-through selling in February.<p>But as long as the bond market does not break strongly above the August high, traders will assume that the high is in for the next many years. They will look for lower prices. If the bonds rally for a few months, they should form a lower high. The selloff from the August high has been in a tight bear channel. The 1st reversal up from a tight bear is typically minor. Traders expect lower prices.<h3 id=\"3-support-levels-are-magnets\">Support levels are magnets</h3><p>What are the magnets below? An obvious one is the August 2019 high. The blow-off top during the 1st quarter of 2020 was a breakout. A breakout of what? Of the August 19 high. Traders expect a test of that breakout point.<p>Markets often stall at support. Traders wonder if the support will hold and the bull trend will resume. If the 10-month selloff is an early bear trend, it should continue down through several support levels. If it is a bear leg in what will become a trading range for a few years, it will probably bounce.<p>At the moment, while the selloff is not particularly strong, it is strong enough for traders to expect the March 2020 high to hold. They will sell a rally, expecting the selloff to test lower support.<p>The next support is always the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the January 2020 low.<p>If the selloff continues below that, it could reach the November 2018 low. That is the apex of a 6-year trading range, which is something of a triangle. That trading range came late in a bull trend that lasted for 30 years. When a trading range comes late in a bull trend, it typically is the Final Bull Flag. Traders saw that trading range as an area of agreement for a long time. The 2-year rally to the all-time high put the bonds far above that area of agreement. Once there is a reversal, like in March of 2020, the market tends to work its way back to the area of agreement.<p>Depending on whether the bonds continue down in a tight bull channel, or bounce and form a trading range or two on the way down, it could take several years for the bond market to reach that 6-year Final Bull flag at around the November 2018 low. But I keep saying that bonds will be lower 5 and 10 years from now, even if they rally a few times before then.<p>Trends in the bond market often last a decade or two. Therefore, the March 2020 high could be the high for the remainder of your trading career.<h2 id=\"4-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h3 id=\"5-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-a-sell-signal-bar-after-wedge-rally-to-top-of-a-6-year-trading-range\">EURUSD<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart has a sell signal bar after wedge rally to top of a 6-year trading range</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-rally-to-a-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-30-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has wedge rally to a double top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex monthly chart has a bear reversal bar in January. It is therefore a sell signal bar. The tail below is fairly big, which is a sign of a weak sell signal bar. It increases the chance that a reversal down will be minor, which means either a bull flag or a trading range instead of a bear trend.<p>There have been 3 legs up from the March 2020 low, and that makes the yearlong rally a wedge. Also, this is coming just below the February 2018 high, which is the top of a 6-year trading range.<p>The 2nd leg up of a double top is often a wedge. When there is a reversal down, it typically will have at least a couple legs. Also, it usually tests the nearest support, which is at the bottom of the 2nd leg up. That is the November low at 1.16.<p>Once the selloff has a couple legs down to support, the bulls begin to look for a buy setup. It could be a double bottom with the November 4 low. But if the selloff reaches that low, the EURUSD will likely go sideways for several bars (months), before the bulls will begin to buy aggressively again. They want to be certain that the selling has stopped.<p>What happens if the EURUSD continues down below that low? The next support is the March high at 1.15. March was a huge bar, and its high is therefore an important breakout point. Since it was a doji bar, it was neutral. If the selloff gets near a neutral bar, it will probably dip at least a little below that high.<h3 id=\"6-how-can-the-eurusd-go-down-when-tv-says-it-is-going-up\">How can the EURUSD go down when TV says it is going up?</h3><p>What about the uniformly bullish talk on TV? Well, that’s what makes a market. On the monthly chart, the EURUSD Forex market is stalling at the top of a 6-year trading range and the rally is a wedge. When I hear that, I conclude that it will probably reverse down for at least a couple small legs. Nothing is certain, but it will more likely do that, than continue straight up to above the February 2018 high at 1.2555.<p>There is always a bull case. February does not have to fall below the January low and trigger the sell signal. The rally could simply continue up to above the February 2018 high. Also, if there is a reversal down, it could simply last a month or so. If the trend then resumed, traders would look at the yearlong rally as a Small Pullback Bull Trend instead of as a wedge rally to a double top. But, at the moment, a minor reversal down is more likely than a continuation up.<h2 id=\"7-stock-market-news\">Stock market news</h2><h3 id=\"8-gamestop-is-controlled-by-institutions-not-by-small-guys-on-redditcom\">GameStop is controlled by institutions, not by small guys on Reddit.com</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GME-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-30-2.png\" alt=\"Gamestop short overing rally\"></a></figure><p>GME, BB, AMC, and other stocks soaring 30 to 100% a day. Yes, short covering, but the news media is misrepresenting this story. They were so enamored with a David and Goliath fantasy, that they are failing to consider any other explanation. A better historical analogy is tulip mania in the 17th century. GME will probably be sideways to down for many months.<p>They are missing one of the most fundamental points about markets. Markets were created by institutions for their own benefit, and the institutions are quick to seize control. This is true even though the Reddit army temporarily took control of several stocks for several days about a week ago.<p>Yes, Reddit day traders got the rally going by lots of people with $10,000 accounts buying GME stock and call options. But once a big move begins, the institutions see opportunity and many come in. They are so big that they ultimately retake control. There are never enough ants to take down a herd of elephants. The strong institutions will kill both the ants, and the weak institutions that are short.<p>Would I be surprised if the short squeeze continued up to 1,000? Yes. Wednesday was so huge that it will be a very important bar for many years. It is a good candidate for the top. The elephants have begun crushing the ants, and there soon will be none left to buy GME.<p>I believe that much of the trading this week was by institutions. If I were running a high frequency trading firm, I would have told my people early in the week to create appropriate algorithms and start trading. If I were running a short selling shop, I would be telling my traders to short strong rallies, betting against the Reddit army.<p>The goal of the institutions and the day traders is the same. They both see huge moves and tremendous profit potential. But I bet that by Friday, the institutions were the ones making the money. They are very greedy, smart, aggressive, and rich. I suspect that they were creating a big part of the volume.<p>Why are the media ignoring the institutions? Because a David and Goliath story gets far more viewers, and the media needs eyeballs to make money. When they see the opportunity to make money, reason does not matter.<h3 id=\"9-shorts-pay-interest\">Shorts pay interest</h3><p>There is an interesting point about the shorts in GME. They have to sell borrowed stock. The current interest rate that a short has to pay is over 100% per year for GME. The most a short can make is 100%, and that is when the stock goes to zero. Therefore, the short selling firms are risking more than they hope to make. Why would they do that? Because they believe that the probability is very high that they will make enough money to offset the terrible risk/reward. I, too, believe it is a high probability bet, but I think the math is better for me to trade other things.<h3 id=\"10-buying-a-lot-of-otm-calls-makes-a-stock-go-up\">Buying a lot of OTM calls makes a stock go up</h3><p>Many small buyers have been buying far out of the money (OTM) calls, which are relatively cheap because they normally have very little chance of finishing in the money (ITM). The delta is relatively small, often 0.5 (0.5 is big for an OTM stock under normal circumstances) for an extremely OTM call on GME. A delta of 0.5 (50%) means that for every $10 that the stock goes up, the call goes up only $5.<p>But as the stock goes up, the chance of the call finishing in the money goes up. That means its delta goes up. When a trader buys a far OTM call with a delta of only 0.5, the option selling firm only has to buy 50 shares of stock to hedge. Remember, 1 call controls 100 shares.<p>If the stock goes up from option selling firms hedging the calls (buying stock) that they sold, or from small traders buying the stock, the OTM calls become less OTM. The probability of them finishing ITM goes up, which means the delta goes up.<p>If the delta is now 0.8, the option selling firm needs to buy 30 more shares of stock. Therefore, if enough people buy calls, the price of the stock goes up because call selling firms have to buy the stock. It is an interesting feedback loop. Just buying enough OTM calls, hoping the stock will go up, makes the stock go up.<h3 id=\"11-great-for-company-executives\">Great for company executives!</h3><p>Many company executives and board members own a large number of shares of the company’s stock. It is common to have a CEO’s pay tied to the stock’s performance. The assumption is that if a stock goes up, it is because it is being managed well. This kind of pay package incentivizes executives to do a great job. However, with the short squeezes, the executives are doing nothing to contribute to the dramatic increase in the stock’s price, yet are making a fortune.<p>BlackBerry (BB) is another of these squeezed stocks.<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reddit-wallstreet-bets-executive-payday/\" class=\"rank-math-link\" rel=\"noopener\">CBS has reported that its CEO will get a $90 million bonus</a>if BB trades above $30 for 10 days in a row anytime before the end of 2026. The high of the squeeze so far has been just below $30. BB is still up 300% from where it was 2 months ago.<p>GameStop has lost $1.3 billion over the past 3 years, and it is closing 20% of its stores. That is why some hedge funds shorted it over the past year. But with the short squeeze, 4 members of the board of directors sold some shares at a huge profit. Other executives from these squeezed stocks are large shareholders, and they are also selling some of their stock at a huge profit during the squeeze.<h2 id=\"12-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"13-monthly-emini-chart-had-bear-body-in-january\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart had bear body in January</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-sell-signal-bar-for-failed-breakout-above-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-30-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has Emini minor sell signal bar for failed breakout above bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a bear bar in January. Although it did not close on its low, it is still a sell signal bar. This reversal is coming at the top of a 10-year bull channel. There are two other ways to draw a trend channel line as well. Some traders will focus on the one based on the January 2018 and February 2020 highs. Others will see the rally as a wedge top, where the 1st two legs up were in February and September 2020. Whenever there is more than one way to draw a channel, more computers will look for a reversal. With 3 channels, traders expect a pullback and it probably began this month.<p>I said that this month is not a strong sell signal bar because it did not close on its low. Furthermore, the context is not great. Yes, the reversal is coming at the top of bull channels, which means the Emini is failing at resistance. However, the yearlong bull channel is tight. The 1st reversal down from a tight bull channel typically leads to a bull flag, or a trading range, and not a bear trend. If the Emini enters a trading range for several months, the bears would then have a better chance of a trend reversal down.<h3 id=\"14-bad-bull-flag-usually-limits-the-extent-of-rally\">Bad bull flag usually limits the extent of rally</h3><p>I want to bring up another point that I have made several times since October. October was a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. But it was a bear bar, and September was a bear bar as well. Furthermore, the bull flag was coming in a buy climax since the March low, and 10 years into a bull trend. I have been saying that a breakout in this situation typically only lasts about a couple bars, and then traders expect more of a pullback. The bear bar in January at resistance is consistent with this.<p>Another example was the pair of bear bars after the January 2018 buy climax. Although the rally that followed lasted 6 bars (months), it only went above the top of the buy climax for 2 months, before reversing down 20%.<h3 id=\"15-how-low-can-the-emini-go\">How low can the Emini go?</h3><p>If this is the start of a trading range for a few months, the bottom of the range is often at support. That usually means the bottom of the most recent leg up, which began with the November low at around 3200.<p>Look at all of the selloffs since 2011. None has lasted more than 3 months. Yes, there was a 35% correction last year, but it only lasted 2 months. Traders will expect a selloff from here to be brief, like all of the others. The Emini will probably fall 10%, like it has done many times since 2011.<p>Can it fall 35%, like last year? Probably not, at least not without first entering a trading range for several months. And even then, a 35% correction is a 5- to 10- year event. That makes it unlikely in 2021.<h3 id=\"16-what-about-the-bulls\">What about the bulls?</h3><p>Does the Emini have to go down? Can’t it continue up, despite the sell signal bar? Of course, but the sell signal bar in a buy climax at resistance makes a minor reversal more likely, than an immediate continuation of the bull trend.<h2 id=\"17-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-formed-an-outside-down-week-at-top-of-bull-channel\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed an outside down week at top of bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-outside-down-bar-at-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-30-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has outside down bar at top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The S&amp;P500 Emini futures on the weekly chart formed an outside down week this week. This week’s high was above last week’s high, and its low was below last week’s low. It is a sell signal bar for next week.<p>An outside down bar increases the chance of lower prices next week, especially since the bar closed below the low of the prior bar. In addition, this week formed a micro double top with the high from 3 weeks ago. That is also bearish. Moreover, this week reversed down from a break above the top of the channel created by the May 1. 2019 and February 19, 2020 highs. This is a sign of a failed bull breakout.<p>Despite these bearish factors, the rally from the November 9 low has been in a tight bull channel. A reversal down in a tight bull channel, in a strong bull trend, is typically minor. That means it will probably form a trading range and not a bear trend.<p>However, a reversal down from a buy climax at resistance usually will have at least a couple small legs down. Also, traders will look for it to test support. The nearest support is the November 9 low, which is where the 3-month bull channel began. That is around 3,500.<p>If the Emini falls strongly below that, the next target is the bottom of the most recent leg up, which is the October low at around 3,200. That was the 2nd low in a double bottom bull flag.<p>A bull flag late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. When there is a reversal down, the bottom of the Final Flag is a magnet. Therefore, if this selloff is relentless, it could continue down to 3,200 over the next couple months.<p>The entire rally from the March low has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. The longest pullback lasted 4 weeks. This could be another small pullback. For example, if next week is a bull bar, it will form a High 1 buy signal bar. Traders will look for a resumption of the bull trend on the following week.<p>At the moment, it is more likely that the Emini will trade sideways to down for at least a few weeks. It should test the November 10 low at around 3,500. But a strong bull bar next week will make a resumption of the bull trend more likely.<h2 id=\"18-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-broke-below-3-month-bull-channel\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke below 3-month bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-breaking-below-bull-trend-line-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-1-30-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart breaking below bull trend line. Emini minor sell signal.\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had two big bear days this week. This is the first time since late October, that the bears got two big bear days in the same leg down. Also, the Emini broke strongly below the January bull trend line (green line) and below the 2-month bull trend line. Traders should expect the selloff to continue down to at least the next support level.<p>That is the bottom of the December trading range (brown box) and the top of the November trading range (blue box), which is around 3,600. Since the rally was a Spike and Channel Bull Trend, the reversal could get down to the start of the channel, as it often does. That is the November 10 low at around 3,500. The market then typically evolves into a trading range for 10 to 20 bars before deciding what it will do next.<p>But what about the bulls? Everyone on TV is bullish, and traders have been buying every 1- to 3-day selloff since late October. So far, this is just a 3-day selloff in a bull trend. But the two big bear bars, and the break below the bull trend lines, makes this different from the others. Therefore, traders should expect a test down to at least 3,600 within a week or two.<p>Can the bulls regain control next week, like they have done after every selloff for 3 months? Yes, but they will need at least one strong bull bar early next week. They probably will need at least a couple big bull bars. Without that, traders will expect the selloff to continue down to 3,500 to 3,600, which is about a 10% correction.<h2 id=\"19-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
