It reduces the chance that the EURUSD going far below it without another pullback.<li>Al has been saying for a few weeks that there should be a sideways to up move lasting at least a couple months starting from where the EURUSD is now or from slightly lower. The EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/how-to-trade-manual/trading-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trading range</a>. Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>Al has also said that currencies have an increased chance of reversing in early January. The current bear trend began on January 6<sup>th</sup>of 2021. The bears hope that the yearlong bear trend is a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008. More likely, the seven-year trading range will continue.<li>The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Daily-Bulls-Testing-Top-of-Tight-Trading-Range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-2-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily Chart Bulls Testing Top of Tight Trading Range\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD formed an ioi (inside-outside-inside) with a breakout higher on Friday.<li>Friday closed near the high but has a prominent tail above and the bulls have not yet broken above the tight trading range.<li>The bears are hoping that this rally will form a bear flag and continue the yearlong bear trend.

There is a 50-50% probability of a bull and bear breakout. It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse.<li>In the last 2 weeks, bears have failed to create strong bear bars or consecutive bear bars while the bull bars have bigger bodies, are more prominent and have closes near their highs.<li>Odds slightly favor the bulls in terms of buying pressure within this tight trading range in the last 2 weeks.<li>The bulls want a strong breakout above the November 18 high and measured move up which will take them to the November 10 high which was the start of the sell climax on the daily chart. If those legs up are strong, there could be a rally back to the October 28 high.&nbsp;<li>If the reversal is more sideways, there could be a new low. However, with the chart in a 7-year trading range, traders still expect a couple of months of sideways to up trading to begin soon.&nbsp;<li>There’s only a 30% chance that the small pullback bear trend will continue down to last year’s low without at least a rally lasting a couple of months or more.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Monthly-Dec-Bull-outside-Bar-with-Small-Tail-Above.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-2-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart December Bull Outside Bar with Small Tail Above, Closed 2021 near new all-time high.\"></a></figure><ul><li>The December monthly Emini candlestick closed as an outside bull bar at a new all-time high. There is a long tail below and a prominent tail above.<li>November Low 1 sell signal failed when December went above its high this week.&nbsp;<li>The prominent tail above also means the bulls are not as strong as they could have been.<li>We have said that if December were an outside up month on the monthly chart, it would increase the chances of higher prices in January.&nbsp;<li>The next target for the bulls is the top of the trend channel line around the big round number 5000.<li>The bar after an outside bar often is an inside bar or has a lot of overlapping price action with the outside bar. If January is an inside bar, it would form an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern which is a breakout situation.<li>December is the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October so therefore a micro wedge. Since the bull trend is extreme, traders are looking for reasons to take some profits. A micro wedge is often a trigger for profit-taking. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down.&nbsp;<li>However, since December is a bull bar closing near its high, it is a weak sell signal bar for a strong reversal down.<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a micro wedge even if January trades slightly higher first. They want January to be a failed breakout above December outside up bar, similar to November. A third reversal has a higher probability of working.<li>Can this rally continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback? That is less likely. It is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a five or six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up from a double bottom bull flag and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down.<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months and not continue straight down into a bear trend. Even if it sells off for 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-Small-Bull-Doji-Bar-with-Tail-above-at-ATH.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-2-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Weekly Chart Small Bull Doji Bar with Tail above at ATH\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a bull doji bar at a new all-time high with a prominent tail above. It broke above the 8-week trading range, but the prominent tail and small body mean the bulls are not as strong as they could have been.<li>The 8-week trading range late in a trend often is a final bull flag. Therefore, a rally from here may fail within 3 to 5 weeks, possibly at the top of the bull channel and possibly around the 5000 big round Number.<li>Therefore, if the market does go up over the next several weeks, it probably will not go up very far before there is a reversal down to the bottom of the bull flag, which is the December low.<li>We have said that a tight trading range is a breakout mode pattern and has a 50-50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout. It also has a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse within a couple of bars. Because it’s in a strong bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>The bears want a higher high double top with November 22 or a wedge top with September 2, November 22. They want any breakout above the tight trading range to fail and then a test of the December low followed by a measured move down which will take them to the Oct low.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create follow-through selling and consecutive bear bars closing near their lows. They will need a surprise big bear bar or consecutive bear bars closing near their lows to convince traders that a deeper pullback may be developing. At the very least, they need a strong bear reversal bar and a micro double top.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to up more.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Daily-Small-Pullback-after-New-High-Wedge-Top-at-TCL-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-2-5.png\" alt=\"SP500 Daily Chart Small Pullback after New High &amp; Wedge Top at TCL\"></a></figure><ul><li>Monday broke above the 8-week tight trading range into a new all-time high. The Emini made another new all-time high on Thursday but closed as a bear bar.<li>The rally from December 20 is strong enough for traders to expect at least a small second leg sideways to up move.<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a higher high double top with November 22 or a larger wedge top with November 22 and September 2. They then want a pullback to the December 3 possible final flag low and then a breakout and measured move which would take them down to the October 3<sup>rd</sup>low which was the start of the wedge rally, and which is a common magnet after a wedge reversal.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create consecutive strong bear bars closing near their lows. Every pullback has been bought by the bulls since the pandemic crash.<li>They will need consecutive bear bars closing near their lows to convince traders that a deeper pullback is underway.<li>The next targets for the bulls are the top of the trend channel line around 4900 and a measured move up based on the 2-month trading range (Nov-Dec) to around the 5000 big round number.<li>2021 closed near the high for the year. It is a statement of how strong the bulls have been over the past two years period. However, since this week did not close so near to the high, the bulls will require a big gap up of at least 42 points to create a gap up to a new all-time high on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. That may be too far for the bulls to do on Monday.<li>Can the bull trend continue straight up for a measured move based upon the height of the two-month trading range which would take them to around 5000?<li>There is always such a possibility. It would then be a parabolic buy climax and odds of profit-taking would increase after that as there would be a trend channel line overshoot on the daily chart.<li>More likely, traders will either take profits from above the November high which would create a wedge top with the November 22 and September 2 high.<li>Therefore, there probably will be at least a couple of months of profit-taking starting sometime early next year.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to up more.</ul><h2 id=\"9-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

If January is an inside bar, it would form an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern which is a breakout situation.<li>December is the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October so therefore a micro wedge. Since the bull trend is extreme, traders are looking for reasons to take some profits. A micro wedge is often a trigger for profit-taking. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down.&nbsp;<li>However, since December is a bull bar closing near its high, it is a weak sell signal bar for a strong reversal down.<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a micro wedge even if January trades slightly higher first. They want January to be a failed breakout above December outside up bar, similar to November. A third reversal has a higher probability of working.<li>Can this rally continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback? That is less likely. It is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a five or six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up from a double bottom bull flag and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down.<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months and not continue straight down into a bear trend. Even if it sells off for 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-Small-Bull-Doji-Bar-with-Tail-above-at-ATH.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-2-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Weekly Chart Small Bull Doji Bar with Tail above at ATH\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a bull doji bar at a new all-time high with a prominent tail above. It broke above the 8-week trading range, but the prominent tail and small body mean the bulls are not as strong as they could have been.<li>The 8-week trading range late in a trend often is a final bull flag. Therefore, a rally from here may fail within 3 to 5 weeks, possibly at the top of the bull channel and possibly around the 5000 big round Number.<li>Therefore, if the market does go up over the next several weeks, it probably will not go up very far before there is a reversal down to the bottom of the bull flag, which is the December low.<li>We have said that a tight trading range is a breakout mode pattern and has a 50-50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout. It also has a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse within a couple of bars. Because it’s in a strong bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>The bears want a higher high double top with November 22 or a wedge top with September 2, November 22.

They will need a surprise big bear bar or consecutive bear bars closing near their lows to convince traders that a deeper pullback may be developing. At the very least, they need a strong bear reversal bar and a micro double top.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%.

Every pullback has been bought by the bulls since the pandemic crash.<li>They will need consecutive bear bars closing near their lows to convince traders that a deeper pullback is underway.<li>The next targets for the bulls are the top of the trend channel line around 4900 and a measured move up based on the 2-month trading range (Nov-Dec) to around the 5000 big round number.<li>2021 closed near the high for the year. It is a statement of how strong the bulls have been over the past two years period. However, since this week did not close so near to the high, the bulls will require a big gap up of at least 42 points to create a gap up to a new all-time high on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. That may be too far for the bulls to do on Monday.<li>Can the bull trend continue straight up for a measured move based upon the height of the two-month trading range which would take them to around 5000?<li>There is always such a possibility. It would then be a parabolic buy climax and odds of profit-taking would increase after that as there would be a trend channel line overshoot on the daily chart.<li>More likely, traders will either take profits from above the November high which would create a wedge top with the November 22 and September 2 high.<li>Therefore, there probably will be at least a couple of months of profit-taking starting sometime early next year.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to up more.</ul><h2 id=\"9-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There will probably be more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low.<li>There is a micro double top with the December 30 high and a wedge top with the September 2 and November 22 highs.<li>It is important to note that the late December rally was strong. A reversal down at this point should be minor.<li>If there is follow-through selling today, it should be a pullback in the bull trend and not a trend reversal. The bulls will buy any 2- to 3-day selloff.<li>What about the wedge on the daily chart? The October rally was so strong that it might have reset the count. Therefore, the November 22 high might be a new 1<sup>st</sup>leg up in what will become a wedge.<li>While the rally from the October low will probably eventually lead to a wedge top and then a reversal down to the December 3 or October 4 low in the spring or summer, traders should expect higher prices for at least another month or two.<li>Magnets above are the top of the bull channel (currently around 4850) and the 5,000 Big Round Number.<li>The monthly chart is having a 3<sup>rd</sup>push up since the September high. That micro wedge will usually attract profit takers, and it should lead to a 2-month pullback beginning within a couple months.<li>However, the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Therefore, even if there is a sharp selloff down to the October low in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of this year, it should be minor.<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months. A trading range in a bull trend is usually a bull flag. Therefore, traders should expect a bull breakout of the trading range later in the year.<li>The gap up in April 2020 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.<li>I plan to create a video later this week about the yearly and monthly charts.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 1 point in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a Spike and Channel Bear Trend day. In the 2<sup>nd</sup>half of the day, the Emini rallied up to the start of the bear channel, which is typical.<li>Yesterday’s strong reversal up from its sell climax day reduces the chance of a big bear day today.<li>Yesterday was a Big Down, Big Up day.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-7-week-tight-trading-range-after-sell-climax-breaking-below-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-5-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD 7 week tight trading range after sell climax breaking below bear channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>Tight trading range for 7 weeks so Breakout Mode. Since it is in a bear trend, bear breakout is slightly more likely than bull breakout.<li>In November, EURUSD had a sell climax that broke far below bear channel.<li>Currently, getting near top of channel by going sideways instead of up. Traders might wait for EURUSD to reach bear trend line (top of channel) before either breaking above and starting a rally, or reversing down for another leg in the bear trend.<li>But if there is a bear breakout, a tight trading range late in a trend is usually the Final Flag. Therefore, there will probably be a reversal up after about a measured move down.<li>Less likely, the yearlong bear trend will continue down to below the bottom of the 7-year trading range on the monthly chart without at least a 2- to 3-month bounce.<li>As strong as the bear trend has been on the daily chart, it is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally on the monthly chart (not shown). The lack of consecutive big bear candlesticks on the monthly chart over the past year makes this selloff more likely a leg in the 7-year trading range than a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008.<li>Traders therefore should expect at least a couple months of sideways to up trading to begin within the next couple months. The bulls hope there is a breakout above the 7-week trading range and yearlong bear channel and then a rally for 2 to 3 months.<li>Trend reversals in the Forex markets have an increased chance of forming just after the start of the year. The current bear trend began on January 6 of last year. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a rally starting in the next few weeks.<li>However, it is slightly more likely to begin after one more brief leg down to below the June 19, 2020 higher low.<li>In this 7-week tight trading range, traders are buying near the bottom and selling near the top. They are taking quick profits, betting on continued reversals every day or two.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-trading-range-and-then-strong-bear-trend-after-FOMC-minutes.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range and then strong bear trend after FOMC minutes\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Today was a trading range until the FOMC minutes at 11 am PT.<li>There was a sharp rally to the 60-minute EMA and then a strong reversal down.<li>I have said a few times that the Emini probably had to dip below the December 16 high, which it did today. That is because the rally on the daily chart is a possible wedge. Pullbacks typically fall below the prior high, which was the December 16 high.<li>The bears are hoping that the current wedge top reversal on the daily chart is the start of a move down to the December and October lows. But they will need at least a couple more bear days before that becomes likely.<li>More likely, this strong selloff is just a pullback in the bull trend.<li>Because today was a Bear Surprise Bar on the daily chart, there should be at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down within a few days. Most bulls will want a micro double bottom before looking for the bull trend to resume.<li>Since today was an extreme sell climax day, there is a 70% chance that tomorrow will have at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Since it is in a bear trend, bear breakout is slightly more likely than bull breakout.<li>In November, EURUSD had a sell climax that broke far below bear channel.<li>Currently, getting near top of channel by going sideways instead of up. Traders might wait for EURUSD to reach bear trend line (top of channel) before either breaking above and starting a rally, or reversing down for another leg in the bear trend.<li>But if there is a bear breakout, a tight trading range late in a trend is usually the Final Flag. Therefore, there will probably be a reversal up after about a measured move down.<li>Less likely, the yearlong bear trend will continue down to below the bottom of the 7-year trading range on the monthly chart without at least a 2- to 3-month bounce.<li>As strong as the bear trend has been on the daily chart, it is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally on the monthly chart (not shown). The lack of consecutive big bear candlesticks on the monthly chart over the past year makes this selloff more likely a leg in the 7-year trading range than a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008.<li>Traders therefore should expect at least a couple months of sideways to up trading to begin within the next couple months. The bulls hope there is a breakout above the 7-week trading range and yearlong bear channel and then a rally for 2 to 3 months.<li>Trend reversals in the Forex markets have an increased chance of forming just after the start of the year. The current bear trend began on January 6 of last year. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a rally starting in the next few weeks.<li>However, it is slightly more likely to begin after one more brief leg down to below the June 19, 2020 higher low.<li>In this 7-week tight trading range, traders are buying near the bottom and selling near the top. They are taking quick profits, betting on continued reversals every day or two.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-trading-range-and-then-strong-bear-trend-after-FOMC-minutes.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range and then strong bear trend after FOMC minutes\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Today was a trading range until the FOMC minutes at 11 am PT.<li>There was a sharp rally to the 60-minute EMA and then a strong reversal down.<li>I have said a few times that the Emini probably had to dip below the December 16 high, which it did today. That is because the rally on the daily chart is a possible wedge. Pullbacks typically fall below the prior high, which was the December 16 high.<li>The bears are hoping that the current wedge top reversal on the daily chart is the start of a move down to the December and October lows. But they will need at least a couple more bear days before that becomes likely.<li>More likely, this strong selloff is just a pullback in the bull trend.<li>Because today was a Bear Surprise Bar on the daily chart, there should be at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down within a few days. Most bulls will want a micro double bottom before looking for the bull trend to resume.<li>Since today was an extreme sell climax day, there is a 70% chance that tomorrow will have at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Weak follow-through after Wednesday’s big bear day.<li>Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar at the 50-day MA. The bulls hope that Wednesday is just a bear trap in a bull trend.<li>However, yesterday was a doji bar, which is a weak buy signal, especially after a big bear day. Also, it barely touched the 50-day MA and many traders will not consider that an adequate test. Therefore, there probably will be more sellers than buyers above its high.<li>This week is outside down on the weekly chart. The bears want the week to close near its low. At a minimum, they want it to close below last week’s low. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<li>The bulls would like this week to close above last week’s low. That would increase the chance that last week will be more sideways than down.<li>The Emini stalled at every Big Round Number from the pandemic low except one (it quickly broke above 4,000). It is now stalling at 4800. Traders expect a move above, but they have not yet decided how long the pullback will last or how low it will go.<li>January so far is a bear bar and a 3<sup>rd</sup>reversal since October, but it is still early in the month. There is still plenty of time for the Emini to get back to the high.<li>On the yearly chart, 2022 broke above the 2021 high. It also broke above the December high on the monthly chart, which is the same as the 2021 high.<li>It is common for the Emini to pull back from a breakout above a strong bull bar on a higher time frame chart. However, it will usually break above it again before deciding whether to reverse down very far. If it then reverses a 2<sup>nd</sup>time, the bears will have a better chance of a bigger correction.<li>Wednesday was a big enough Bear Surprise bar for traders to expect at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down. Many bulls will wait for at least a micro double bottom before buying again.<li>There is a wedge top with the September 2 and November 22 highs. It is at a measured move from the October 30, 2020 low to the gap above the April 1, 2021 high, and at a measured move from the October 4 low to the September 2 high.<li>However, there have been many reversals over the past 2 years and all have been minor.<li>It continues to be more likely that Wednesday will fail to lead to a bear trend and that the Emini will make a new high before falling below the December low. However, one or two more big bear days would likely lead to a test of the December low.<li>It is important to note that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. Trading ranges often begin before bull or bear trends end. There were many times when the bears had clusters of big bear bars closing near their lows since July.<li>For the Emini to evolve into a trading range, it needs a bear leg. The bear leg will probably begin in the next couple of months.<li>The Emini should fall to the December low and possibly the October low by summer.<li>However, it will probably form a double bottom with one of those lows instead of continuing down.<li>So, yes, it will probably break below the bull trend line from the October 30, 2020 low to the October 4, 2021 low. And it could be sideways for many months. But the bull trend is strong enough for traders to look for a resumption of the bull trend in the 2<sup>nd</sup>half of the year.<li>Over the next several days, traders will decide if the 2-day selloff will be a 50% retracement of the late December rally or if the wedge top will lead to a test of the December low.<li>It is currently more likely that this is a pullback from the late December rally than the start of a bear trend, but there will probably be another push down within a few days.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 3 points in the overnight Globex session after the Unemployment Report.<li>Yesterday was a trading range day after Wednesday’s sell climax. The sell climax was so extreme that traders might want to see more time going sideways before deciding if Wednesday was the start of a swing down on the daily chart or just a test of the 50-day MA. That increases the chance of another sideways day.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. This week is an outside down week and therefore the most important weekly magnet above is last week’s low.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-sell-climax-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-7.png\" alt=\"Emini at measured move targets with sell climax and higher low major trend reversal, then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

An outside bear bar on the weekly chart. It is a 50% pullback from the December 20 rally. Bears want a test of the December low from a higher high double top with November 22, or a wedge top with September 2 and November 22 followed by a breakout lower to October’s low. However, more likely, the current pullback will be minor and be followed by a retest of the trend’s extreme.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex traded below last week’s low but reversed back higher to close in the upper half of the week’s range.

Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This last year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>Al has also said that currencies have an increased chance of reversing in early January. The current bear trend began on January 6<sup>th</sup>of 2021. The bears hope that the yearlong bear trend is a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008. More likely, the seven-year trading range will continue.<li>A 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"3-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Daily-Failed-Low-4-Short-Higher-Low-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-9-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily Chart Failed Low 4 Short Higher Low\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD reversed lower sharply from a low 4 short setup on Monday but did not get a strong follow-through selling the following day.<li>The bulls manage to create a reversal higher on Friday from a higher low to close slightly below the trading range high.<li>The bears are hoping that the seven-week trading range will form a bear flag and continue the yearlong bear trend. There were several reversals lower from a double top bear flag, a wedge bear flag and a low 4 short setup this week which had no follow-through selling. They want the pullback (bounce) on Friday to be a deep pullback followed by a second leg sideways to down and then a test and a strong breakout of the trading range low.<li>The bulls are forming higher lows (November 24, December 15, and Jan 4) and have more prominent bull bodies within the tight trading range in recent weeks.<li>They want a strong breakout above the November 18 high and measured move up which will take them to the November 10 high which was the start of the sell climax on the daily chart. If those legs up are strong, there could be a rally back to the October 28 high.&nbsp;<li>However, a trading range is an area of balance and a breakout mode situation.

It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that picking which move up or down will lead to a successful breakout of the trading range is a low probability bet. Reversals are always more likely in trading ranges, and this remains true.<li>If the reversal is more sideways, there could be a new low. However, a tight trading range after an extended bear trend tends to be the final bear flag.&nbsp;<li>With the chart in a 7-year trading range, traders still expect a couple of months of sideways to up trading to begin soon.&nbsp;<li>There’s only a 30% chance that the small pullback bear trend will continue down to last year’s low without at least a rally lasting a couple of months or more.</ul><h2 id=\"4-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"5-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Monthly-Jan-Bear-Bar-after-New-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-9-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart January Bear Bar after New High\"></a></figure><ul><li>The January monthly Emini candlestick currently is a bear bar trading near its low after making a new high. It is the 3<sup>rd</sup>reversal since September.&nbsp;<li>December was a bull bar closing near its high therefore it is a weak sell signal bar for a strong reversal down.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a micro wedge even if January trades slightly higher first. They want January to be a failed breakout above December outside up bar, like November. A third reversal has a higher probability of working.<li>December is the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October so therefore a micro wedge. Since the bull trend is extreme, traders are looking for reasons to take some profits. A micro wedge is often a trigger for profit-taking. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down.&nbsp;<li>The bar after an outside bar often is an inside bar or has a lot of overlapping price action with the outside bar. If January is a bear bar closing near the low, it would be a sell signal bar for February.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Therefore, even if there is a sharp selloff down to the October low in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of this year, it should be minor. The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months. A trading range in a bull trend is usually a bull flag. Therefore, traders should expect a bull breakout of the trading range later in the year.<li>The bulls want a continuation higher to a measured move target (using the Aug-Oct trading range height) which will take them to 4930 near the top of the trend channel line. The 5000 big round number is a magnet above.<li>Can this rally continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback? That is less likely. It is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up from a double bottom bull flag and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months and not continue straight down into a bear trend. Even if it sells off for 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart.<li>Al also said that the gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-Bear-Bar-Following-Micro-Double-Top-Wedge-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-9-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Outside Bear Bar Following Micro Double Top and Wedge Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was an outside bear bar closing near the low. It made a new high earlier in the week but reversed lower from a micro double top and a wedge top.<li>Last week’s breakout bar above the 8-week trading range had a prominent tail and small body which means the bulls are not as strong as they could have been. The 8-week trading range late in a trend often is a final bull flag. Therefore, a rally from here may fail within 3 to 5 weeks, possibly at the top of the bull channel and possibly around the 5000 big round Number.<li>A tight trading range is a breakout mode pattern and has a 50-50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout. It also has a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse within a couple of bars. Because it’s in a strong bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Therefore, if the market does go up over the next several weeks, it probably will not go up very far before there is a reversal down to the bottom of the bull flag, which is the December low.<li>Can next week reverse higher following this week’s big bear bar? Of course. It has done so many times in the past 2 years and is common in a strong bull trend.<li>The bulls want this week to simply be a breakout test followed by a second leg sideways to up. They see this week’s big bear bar simply as a 50% pullback from the December 20 rally.<li>Since this week’s candlestick is a bear bar closing near the low, it is a sell signal bar for next week. The bears want a higher high double top with November 22 or a wedge top with September 2, November 22. They want a test of the December low followed by a measured move down which will take them to the Oct low.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create follow-through selling and consecutive bear bars closing near their lows. They will need the next 1- to 2-weeks to be bear bars closing near their lows to convince traders that a deeper pullback may be developing.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>Next week might trade slightly lower to test if there are more sellers or buyers below this week’s low. However, traders should also be prepared for a strong reversal up at any time.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Daily-Pullback-Following-Micro-Double-Top-Wedge-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-9-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart Pullback Following Micro Double Top and Wedge Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>Tuesday made a new all-time high but closed as a bear bar with a tail below. The Emini then reversed lower from a micro double top and a wedge top with November 22 and September 2.<li>The bulls see the move lower as a 50% pullback from the December 20 strong rally. However, the sell-off is in a tight 4-bar bear microchannel. Bulls may not buy aggressively until there is at least a micro double bottom. This means that there may be at least a small second leg sideways to down next week.<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a higher high double top with November 22 or a larger wedge top with November 22 and September 2. They want a pullback to the December 3<sup>rd</sup>possible final flag low and then a breakout and measured move which would take them down to the October 3<sup>rd</sup>low which was the start of the wedge rally, and which is a common magnet after a wedge reversal.<li>If the bears continue to get a few more consecutive bear bars closing near their lows, the odds of a deeper pullback below December’s low increases.<li>However, every pullback has been bought by the bulls since the pandemic crash. The 50-day and 100-day moving average and bull trend line remain strong supports. Until there is a strong break with follow-through selling below these support levels, bulls will continue to bet on higher prices and every pullback to be minor.<li>Al said that that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. Trading ranges often begin before bull or bear trends end.&nbsp;<li>For the Emini to evolve into a trading range, it needs a bear leg. The bear leg will probably begin in the next couple of months. The Emini should fall to the December low and possibly the October low by summer.<li>However, it will probably form a double bottom with one of those lows instead of continuing down into a bear trend.<li>Therefore, there probably will be at least a couple of months of profit-taking starting in the next few months.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to down for next week, but traders should be prepared for a strong reversal up at any moment.</ul><h2 id=\"8-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

They want the pullback (bounce) on Friday to be a deep pullback followed by a second leg sideways to down and then a test and a strong breakout of the trading range low.<li>The bulls are forming higher lows (November 24, December 15, and Jan 4) and have more prominent bull bodies within the tight trading range in recent weeks.<li>They want a strong breakout above the November 18 high and measured move up which will take them to the November 10 high which was the start of the sell climax on the daily chart. If those legs up are strong, there could be a rally back to the October 28 high.&nbsp;<li>However, a trading range is an area of balance and a breakout mode situation.

It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that picking which move up or down will lead to a successful breakout of the trading range is a low probability bet. Reversals are always more likely in trading ranges, and this remains true.<li>If the reversal is more sideways, there could be a new low. However, a tight trading range after an extended bear trend tends to be the final bear flag.&nbsp;<li>With the chart in a 7-year trading range, traders still expect a couple of months of sideways to up trading to begin soon.&nbsp;<li>There’s only a 30% chance that the small pullback bear trend will continue down to last year’s low without at least a rally lasting a couple of months or more.</ul><h2 id=\"4-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"5-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Monthly-Jan-Bear-Bar-after-New-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-9-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart January Bear Bar after New High\"></a></figure><ul><li>The January monthly Emini candlestick currently is a bear bar trading near its low after making a new high. It is the 3<sup>rd</sup>reversal since September.&nbsp;<li>December was a bull bar closing near its high therefore it is a weak sell signal bar for a strong reversal down.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a micro wedge even if January trades slightly higher first. They want January to be a failed breakout above December outside up bar, like November. A third reversal has a higher probability of working.<li>December is the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October so therefore a micro wedge. Since the bull trend is extreme, traders are looking for reasons to take some profits. A micro wedge is often a trigger for profit-taking. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down.&nbsp;<li>The bar after an outside bar often is an inside bar or has a lot of overlapping price action with the outside bar. If January is a bear bar closing near the low, it would be a sell signal bar for February.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Therefore, even if there is a sharp selloff down to the October low in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of this year, it should be minor. The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months. A trading range in a bull trend is usually a bull flag. Therefore, traders should expect a bull breakout of the trading range later in the year.<li>The bulls want a continuation higher to a measured move target (using the Aug-Oct trading range height) which will take them to 4930 near the top of the trend channel line. The 5000 big round number is a magnet above.<li>Can this rally continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback? That is less likely. It is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up from a double bottom bull flag and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months and not continue straight down into a bear trend. Even if it sells off for 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart.<li>Al also said that the gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-Bear-Bar-Following-Micro-Double-Top-Wedge-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-9-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Outside Bear Bar Following Micro Double Top and Wedge Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was an outside bear bar closing near the low. It made a new high earlier in the week but reversed lower from a micro double top and a wedge top.<li>Last week’s breakout bar above the 8-week trading range had a prominent tail and small body which means the bulls are not as strong as they could have been. The 8-week trading range late in a trend often is a final bull flag. Therefore, a rally from here may fail within 3 to 5 weeks, possibly at the top of the bull channel and possibly around the 5000 big round Number.<li>A tight trading range is a breakout mode pattern and has a 50-50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout. It also has a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse within a couple of bars. Because it’s in a strong bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Therefore, if the market does go up over the next several weeks, it probably will not go up very far before there is a reversal down to the bottom of the bull flag, which is the December low.<li>Can next week reverse higher following this week’s big bear bar? Of course. It has done so many times in the past 2 years and is common in a strong bull trend.<li>The bulls want this week to simply be a breakout test followed by a second leg sideways to up. They see this week’s big bear bar simply as a 50% pullback from the December 20 rally.<li>Since this week’s candlestick is a bear bar closing near the low, it is a sell signal bar for next week. The bears want a higher high double top with November 22 or a wedge top with September 2, November 22. They want a test of the December low followed by a measured move down which will take them to the Oct low.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create follow-through selling and consecutive bear bars closing near their lows. They will need the next 1- to 2-weeks to be bear bars closing near their lows to convince traders that a deeper pullback may be developing.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>Next week might trade slightly lower to test if there are more sellers or buyers below this week’s low. However, traders should also be prepared for a strong reversal up at any time.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Daily-Pullback-Following-Micro-Double-Top-Wedge-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-9-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart Pullback Following Micro Double Top and Wedge Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>Tuesday made a new all-time high but closed as a bear bar with a tail below. The Emini then reversed lower from a micro double top and a wedge top with November 22 and September 2.<li>The bulls see the move lower as a 50% pullback from the December 20 strong rally. However, the sell-off is in a tight 4-bar bear microchannel. Bulls may not buy aggressively until there is at least a micro double bottom. This means that there may be at least a small second leg sideways to down next week.<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a higher high double top with November 22 or a larger wedge top with November 22 and September 2. They want a pullback to the December 3<sup>rd</sup>possible final flag low and then a breakout and measured move which would take them down to the October 3<sup>rd</sup>low which was the start of the wedge rally, and which is a common magnet after a wedge reversal.<li>If the bears continue to get a few more consecutive bear bars closing near their lows, the odds of a deeper pullback below December’s low increases.<li>However, every pullback has been bought by the bulls since the pandemic crash. The 50-day and 100-day moving average and bull trend line remain strong supports. Until there is a strong break with follow-through selling below these support levels, bulls will continue to bet on higher prices and every pullback to be minor.<li>Al said that that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. Trading ranges often begin before bull or bear trends end.&nbsp;<li>For the Emini to evolve into a trading range, it needs a bear leg. The bear leg will probably begin in the next couple of months. The Emini should fall to the December low and possibly the October low by summer.<li>However, it will probably form a double bottom with one of those lows instead of continuing down into a bear trend.<li>Therefore, there probably will be at least a couple of months of profit-taking starting in the next few months.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to down for next week, but traders should be prepared for a strong reversal up at any moment.</ul><h2 id=\"8-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was also a test of the 100-day MA and the 4,600 Big Round Number.<li>Yesterday triggered the buy signal by going above Monday’s high. It was a big bull bar, a strong entry bar, and it increases the chance of higher prices over the coming days.<li>The bulls are hoping that the rally will race up to a new high, like after the December 20 bottom.<li>However, this bottom followed a stronger selloff. The rally might stall for at least a couple days around the November 22/December 16 double top.<li>Whether or not it stalls, a new high is more likely than a strong break below the December low.<li>But there should be a reversal down to below the December low and possibly the October low within the 1<sup>st</sup>quarter because the channel on the daily chart has been forming deep pullbacks since October. That increases the chance of a couple legs down to a prior higher low, like the December or October low.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 18 points in the overnight Globex session, gapping above yesterday’s high. If there is a small gap, it will probably close in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day. There is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>Yesterday was a Spike and Channel bull trend. There is a 75% chance of a break below the bottom of the channel and then the evolution into a trading range. The bottom of the range is often at the start of the channel, which is around 4675.<li>The bulls have a 25% chance of a strong breakout above the channel and the transition into an even stronger bull trend without first trading sideways to down for a couple hours early today.<li>There are important magnets above that are within reach.

There is an Emini lower high major trend reversal after a 4-month wedge top and strong leg down in 2-month trading range.<li>But Wednesday was a doji bar and therefore a weak sell signal bar. Also, the rally on Monday and Tuesday was stronger than the selloff at this point.<li>The bears need strong follow-through selling over the next few days to convince traders that the Emini will test the December low before making another new high.<li>Remember, I have been saying that the rally since September looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. Traders are constantly deciding if the evolution to a trading range from a bull trend has begun. Once the bears start to break strongly below higher lows, the Emini will be in a trading range.<li>What about a bear trend on the daily chart? A bear trend is a series of lower highs and lows. The bears will need at least a couple lower lows.<li>Even then, the Emini will still be in a bull trend on the weekly and monthly charts.<li>If there is a reversal down on the monthly chart from its micro wedge, the selloff should only last 2 to 3 bars (months) before the bull trend resumes.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>The bears want the week to close on the low. There would then be consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows on the weekly chart. That bear surprise would likely have at least a couple legs down and lead to a break below the December low.<li>At a minimum, the bears want the week to close below the open. It would then be a bear follow-through bar after last week’s big bear bar on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<li>The bulls want the week to have a bull body on the weekly chart.<li>While they would like the week to close on its high, there is only a small chance of that happening since the high is so far above yesterday’s close.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is 30+ points down in the overnight Globex session. It will therefore gap down today.<li>The bears want another strong bear trend day and then a break below the December low. That is probably too far to reach today.<li>Also, the day after a sell climax day only has a 25% chance of being a strong bear day. But it has a 50% chance of some follow-through selling in the first hour.<li>Since yesterday was a sell climax day, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the second hour.<li>Since the Emini has been sideways for 2 months, there have been reversals every few days. Therefore, despite yesterday’s strong selloff, today could reverse up at some point today.<li>If the market reverses up on the open, the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up will probably be minor because yesterday’s late selloff was in a tight bear channel. The bulls would probably need a test down and a 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal up if they are to get a bull trend day today.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-bear-channel-and-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bear channel and trend from the open.

It currently has a bear body.<li>This weak follow-through increases the chance of a test down to the top of the 7-week tight trading range early next week.<li>The bears want the breakout to fail. They will need at least a couple big bear bars to make that likely. Currently, the odds favor higher prices.<li>First target for the bulls is a breakout above the October 12 low, which was the breakout point for the November collapse.<li>Above that is the November 9 high, which was the top of the most recent sell climax.<li>The most important target is the October 28 major lower high. If the bulls break strongly above that, then the yearlong bear trend will have ended. The daily chart would then either be in a trading range or a bull trend.<li>On the weekly chart, this week is a bull bar with a close above the bear trend line and the top of the 7-week tight trading range. The bears will try to get the week to close back at the trend line instead of on the high of the week. That would reduce the chance that the reversal up will be successful.<li>If next week is a bull bar, it will increase the chance of a reversal up to the October 28 high.<li>If instead it is a bear bar closing near its low, it will be a Low 2 sell signal bar for a failed breakout above the tight trading range and bear trend line.

Also, the rally on Monday and Tuesday was stronger than the selloff at this point.<li>The bears need strong follow-through selling over the next few days to convince traders that the Emini will test the December low before making another new high.<li>Remember, I have been saying that the rally since September looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. Traders are constantly deciding if the evolution to a trading range from a bull trend has begun. Once the bears start to break strongly below higher lows, the Emini will be in a trading range.<li>What about a bear trend on the daily chart? A bear trend is a series of lower highs and lows. The bears will need at least a couple lower lows.<li>Even then, the Emini will still be in a bull trend on the weekly and monthly charts.<li>If there is a reversal down on the monthly chart from its micro wedge, the selloff should only last 2 to 3 bars (months) before the bull trend resumes.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>The bears want the week to close on the low. There would then be consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows on the weekly chart. That bear surprise would likely have at least a couple legs down and lead to a break below the December low.<li>At a minimum, the bears want the week to close below the open. It would then be a bear follow-through bar after last week’s big bear bar on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<li>The bulls want the week to have a bull body on the weekly chart.<li>While they would like the week to close on its high, there is only a small chance of that happening since the high is so far above yesterday’s close.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is 30+ points down in the overnight Globex session. It will therefore gap down today.<li>The bears want another strong bear trend day and then a break below the December low. That is probably too far to reach today.<li>Also, the day after a sell climax day only has a 25% chance of being a strong bear day. But it has a 50% chance of some follow-through selling in the first hour.<li>Since yesterday was a sell climax day, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the second hour.<li>Since the Emini has been sideways for 2 months, there have been reversals every few days. Therefore, despite yesterday’s strong selloff, today could reverse up at some point today.<li>If the market reverses up on the open, the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up will probably be minor because yesterday’s late selloff was in a tight bear channel. The bulls would probably need a test down and a 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal up if they are to get a bull trend day today.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-bear-channel-and-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bear channel and trend from the open. Strong leg down in 2-month trading range.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Forex-pausing-after-breakout-above-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-14-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex pausing after breakout above bear trend line\"></a></figure><ul><li>Wednesday broke far above the 7-week tight trading range and bear trend line from May 25 high.<li>Yesterday was a bull follow-through bar, which increases the chance that the breakout will be the start of a swing up. However, it had a prominent tail on top, and it is therefore weak follow-through.<li>Today so far is another small doji day. It currently has a bear body.<li>This weak follow-through increases the chance of a test down to the top of the 7-week tight trading range early next week.<li>The bears want the breakout to fail. They will need at least a couple big bear bars to make that likely. Currently, the odds favor higher prices.<li>First target for the bulls is a breakout above the October 12 low, which was the breakout point for the November collapse.<li>Above that is the November 9 high, which was the top of the most recent sell climax.<li>The most important target is the October 28 major lower high. If the bulls break strongly above that, then the yearlong bear trend will have ended. The daily chart would then either be in a trading range or a bull trend.<li>On the weekly chart, this week is a bull bar with a close above the bear trend line and the top of the 7-week tight trading range. The bears will try to get the week to close back at the trend line instead of on the high of the week. That would reduce the chance that the reversal up will be successful.<li>If next week is a bull bar, it will increase the chance of a reversal up to the October 28 high.<li>If instead it is a bear bar closing near its low, it will be a Low 2 sell signal bar for a failed breakout above the tight trading range and bear trend line. The bigger the bear body and the more it closes near its low, the more bears will short below this week’s low.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-lower-low-major-trend-reversal-after-failed-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low major trend reversal after failed double top\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>The Emini gapped down, but rallied back to yesterday’s close.<li>After a micro wedge top, it sold off to a lower low double bottom.<li>It was in a triangle for the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the day.<li>It broke below the double bottom and reversed up to close above the open of the week and in the middle of its 2-month trading range.<li>Today is a High 1 buy signal bar for another higher low in the bull channel since the December low.<li>While the Emini should sell off to the December low and probably the October low this year, most reversal attempts fail. Therefore, despite Thursday’s big selloff, a new high is still more likely before there is a strong break below the December low.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bears failed to get follow-through selling following last week’s bear signal bar. The bulls see the 3 pushes down (December 3, December 20, and January 10) as a wedge bull flag and want a strong second leg sideways to up. Bears want a test of the December low followed by a measured move down (using the Nov-Dec trading range height) which will take them to the October low.<p>The&nbsp;<strong>EURUSD&nbsp;</strong>Forex broke above the 7-week tight trading range but the weekly candlestick has a prominent tail above and stalled around the bear trend line. The bulls will need strong follow-through buying next week. If they get a bull bar closing near its high especially above this week’s high, odds of a test towards November 10 and October 28 high increases. However, if next week closes as a bear bar near its low, the odds of a failed breakout above the tight trading range will increase.<h2 id=\"2-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"3-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Weekly-Breakout-above-TR-Lower-High-at-Bear-TL.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Weekly Chart Breakout above TR, Lower High at Bear TL\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a bull bar with tails above and below. It broke above the tight trading range and tested the bear trend line and near the March 2020 high.<li>However, the prominent tail above indicates the breakout was not as strong as the bulls would have liked.<li>Since this week was a bull bar, it is a buy signal bar for next week. The prominent tail above makes it a weaker signal bar.<li>The bulls will need follow-through buying next week to convince traders that a reversal higher is underway. If the bulls manage to get a strong bull bar closing near its high and above this week’s high, odds of a reversal back towards the October 28 high increases.<li>If next week instead is a bear bar closing near its low, odds of a failed breakout increases. Bears will see it as a low 1 short from a lower high at resistance (bear trend line).<li>The bears are hoping this is simply a double top bear flag (November 30 and January 14) to be followed by a continuation of the measured move lower.&nbsp;<li>However, a tight trading range late in a trend often is the final flag of the move. Even if there is a break below the 7-week trading range, odds are it might be the final flag of the bear leg. The EURUSD may then test below June 2020 low before there is a stronger reversal higher from a lower low major trend reversal.<li>A tight trading range is an area of balance and a breakout mode situation. There is a 50-50% probability of a bull and bear breakout. It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse.&nbsp;<li>Al has been saying for a few weeks that there should be a sideways to up move lasting at least a couple of months starting from where the EURUSD is now or from slightly lower. The EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/how-to-trade-manual/trading-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trading range</a>. Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This last year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>Al has also said that currencies have an increased chance of reversing in early January. The current bear trend began on January 6<sup>th</sup>of 2021. The bears hope that the yearlong bear trend is a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008. More likely, the seven-year trading range will continue.<li>A 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Daily-BO-above-TR-Pullback-at-Bear-Trend-Line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily Chart Breakout above TR, Pullback at Bear Trend Line\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD broke above the 7-week tight trading range with strength on Wednesday and got a weak follow through on Thursday testing near March 2020 high but stalled at the bear trend line.<li>Friday was a bear bar but had a prominent tail below. Bulls see this as a breakout test of the tight trading range high.<li>Bulls will need a resumption of the rally early next week to convince traders that a reversal towards November 10 high and October 28 high is underway.<li>The first target for the bulls is a breakout above the October 12 low, which was the breakout point for the November collapse.<li>Al said that the most important target is the October 28 major lower high. If the bulls break strongly above that, then the yearlong bear trend will have ended. The daily chart would then either be in a trading range or a bull trend.<li>If the bears get consecutive bear bars closing near their lows and the EURUSD trades back into the 7-week tight trading range, traders will then conclude that the recent breakout above has failed.<li>The bears see the current move as a lower high test of the bear trend line and breakout point and want the breakout above the tight trading range to fail. They then want a test and breakout below the 7-week tight trading range low followed by a continuation of the 700-pip measured move lower.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create follow-through selling and consecutive big bear bars in the last 4 weeks. The bull bars are more prominent, have bigger bodies and more closes near their highs and has a series of higher lows. The odds slightly favor the bulls in terms of buying pressure.<li>We have said that a trading range is an area of balance and a breakout mode situation. There is a 50-50% probability of a bull and bear breakout. It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse. This remains true.<li>If there is a break below the 7-week tight trading range, odds are it will be the final bear flag of the bear leg followed by a stronger reversal higher from a lower low major trend reversal, probably from slightly below June 2020 low.<li>Al has said that the EURUSD is in a 7-year trading range, so traders still expect a couple of months of sideways to up trading to begin soon.&nbsp;<li>There’s only a 30% chance that the small pullback bear trend will continue down to last year’s low without at least a rally lasting a couple of months or more.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Monthly-Jan-Bear-Bar-with-Tail-Below-Micro-Wedge-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart January Bear Bar with Tail Below, Micro Wedge Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>The January monthly Emini candlestick currently is a bear bar with a tail below after making a new high. It is the 3<sup>rd</sup>reversal since September.&nbsp;<li>December was a bull bar closing near its high therefore it is a weak sell signal bar for a strong reversal down.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a micro wedge even though January traded slightly higher first. They want January to be a failed breakout above December outside up bar, like November. A third reversal has a higher probability of working.<li>December is the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October so therefore a micro wedge. Since the bull trend is extreme, traders are looking for reasons to take some profits. A micro wedge is often a trigger for profit-taking. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down.&nbsp;<li>If January is a bear bar closing near the low, it would be a sell signal bar for February. The more this month closes on its low, the more it will attract sellers, and the more likely the Emini will pull back for a few months.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Therefore, even if there is a sharp selloff down to the October low in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of this year, it should be minor.<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months. A trading range in a bull trend is usually a bull flag. Therefore, traders should expect a bull breakout of the trading range later in the year.<li>The best the bears probably can get this year is a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>The bulls want a continuation higher to a measured move target (using the Aug-Oct trading range height) which will take them to 4930 near the top of the trend channel line. The 5000 big round number is a magnet above.<li>Can this rally continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback? That is less likely. It is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up from a double bottom bull flag and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months and not continue straight down into a bear trend. Even if it sells off for 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart.<li>Al also said that the gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-Weak-Bear-FT-Wedge-Bull-Flag-Wedge-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Weekly Chart Weak Bear Follow-through, Wedge Bull Flag, Wedge Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a bull doji. The bears failed to get strong follow-through selling from last week’s strong sell signal bar. It is a high 1 buy signal bar at the bull trend line. However, because it is a bull doji, it is a weak buy signal bar.<li>The 11-week tight trading range has higher lows (December 3, December 20, and January 10). The bulls see this as a wedge bull flag with higher lows instead of the traditional downward sloping wedge bull flag.<li>They want another strong leg up like the one from October 4 to November 5. A leg 1 = leg 2 measured move will take them to 4930 around the top of the bull channel. The 5000 big round Number is a magnet above.<li>A tight trading range is a breakout mode pattern and has a 50-50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout. It also has a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse within a couple of bars. Because it’s in a strong bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>A tight trading range late in a trend often is the final bull flag. A breakout above it may fail within 3 to 5 weeks, possibly at the top of the bull channel and possibly around the 5000 big round Number.<li>Can next week reverse higher following this week’s test of the bull trend line? The tight bull channel on the weekly chart means the bulls have been buying small pullbacks since the pandemic crash. The bull trend line has been a strong support of the tight bull channel. Until the bears break below it with consecutive big bear bars and follow-through selling, odds are traders will continue to bet on higher prices.<li>Can next week be a big bear bar closing near the low? The probability of this is slightly lower than the bull’s case. If it does, it will be a breakout below the bull trend line and increase the odds that a pullback towards the October low is underway especially if it closes below December’s low.<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a higher high double top (January 4 and November 22) or a wedge top (September 2, November 22, and January 4). They want a test of the December low followed by a measured move down which will take them to the October low.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create follow-through selling and consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows. Without that, traders would not be convinced that a deeper pullback may be developing.<li>An embedded micro wedge may be forming where the first legs up are December 10 and January 4. If we get another leg up to a new high, it would be the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg up since December. A micro wedge in a wedge top has a higher probability of leading to profit-taking pullback.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>This week’s doji bar is an area of balance. There may be some sideways trading range first before traders decide on the direction of the market.&nbsp;<li>Odds slightly favor sideways to upside more.&nbsp;</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Daily-Wedge-Bull-Flag-or-Lower-High-MTR.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart Wedge Bull Flag or Lower High MTR\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini gapped down on Monday and tested the bull trend line and the 100-day moving average but reversed back up by Wednesday to about a 50% pullback (bounce) of the early Jan bear leg.<li>Thursday formed a lower high major trend reversal lower but there was no follow-through on Friday.<li>Friday’s candlestick was a bull bar closing near its high. It is a high 2 bull signal bar for Monday from a higher low at the bull trend line and 100-day moving average support.<li>The bears are hoping that the Emini is reversing down from a wedge top (September 2, November 22, and January 4) and a lower high major trend reversal.<li>They want a pullback to the December 3<sup>rd</sup>low and then a breakout and measured move which would take them down to the October 4 low which was the start of the wedge rally, and which is a common magnet after a wedge reversal.<li>If the bears can create consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows breaking below the bull trend line and the 50-day and 100-day moving average, the odds of a deeper pullback towards the October low increases.<li>However, every pullback has been bought by the bulls since the pandemic crash.

The bears failed to get follow-through selling following last week’s bear signal bar. The bulls see the 3 pushes down (December 3, December 20, and January 10) as a wedge bull flag and want a strong second leg sideways to up. Bears want a test of the December low followed by a measured move down (using the Nov-Dec trading range height) which will take them to the October low.<p>The&nbsp;<strong>EURUSD&nbsp;</strong>Forex broke above the 7-week tight trading range but the weekly candlestick has a prominent tail above and stalled around the bear trend line. The bulls will need strong follow-through buying next week. If they get a bull bar closing near its high especially above this week’s high, odds of a test towards November 10 and October 28 high increases. However, if next week closes as a bear bar near its low, the odds of a failed breakout above the tight trading range will increase.<h2 id=\"2-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"3-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Weekly-Breakout-above-TR-Lower-High-at-Bear-TL.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Weekly Chart Breakout above TR, Lower High at Bear TL\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a bull bar with tails above and below. It broke above the tight trading range and tested the bear trend line and near the March 2020 high.<li>However, the prominent tail above indicates the breakout was not as strong as the bulls would have liked.<li>Since this week was a bull bar, it is a buy signal bar for next week. The prominent tail above makes it a weaker signal bar.<li>The bulls will need follow-through buying next week to convince traders that a reversal higher is underway. If the bulls manage to get a strong bull bar closing near its high and above this week’s high, odds of a reversal back towards the October 28 high increases.<li>If next week instead is a bear bar closing near its low, odds of a failed breakout increases. Bears will see it as a low 1 short from a lower high at resistance (bear trend line).<li>The bears are hoping this is simply a double top bear flag (November 30 and January 14) to be followed by a continuation of the measured move lower.&nbsp;<li>However, a tight trading range late in a trend often is the final flag of the move. Even if there is a break below the 7-week trading range, odds are it might be the final flag of the bear leg. The EURUSD may then test below June 2020 low before there is a stronger reversal higher from a lower low major trend reversal.<li>A tight trading range is an area of balance and a breakout mode situation. There is a 50-50% probability of a bull and bear breakout. It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse.&nbsp;<li>Al has been saying for a few weeks that there should be a sideways to up move lasting at least a couple of months starting from where the EURUSD is now or from slightly lower. The EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/how-to-trade-manual/trading-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trading range</a>. Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This last year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>Al has also said that currencies have an increased chance of reversing in early January. The current bear trend began on January 6<sup>th</sup>of 2021. The bears hope that the yearlong bear trend is a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008. More likely, the seven-year trading range will continue.<li>A 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Daily-BO-above-TR-Pullback-at-Bear-Trend-Line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily Chart Breakout above TR, Pullback at Bear Trend Line\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD broke above the 7-week tight trading range with strength on Wednesday and got a weak follow through on Thursday testing near March 2020 high but stalled at the bear trend line.<li>Friday was a bear bar but had a prominent tail below. Bulls see this as a breakout test of the tight trading range high.<li>Bulls will need a resumption of the rally early next week to convince traders that a reversal towards November 10 high and October 28 high is underway.<li>The first target for the bulls is a breakout above the October 12 low, which was the breakout point for the November collapse.<li>Al said that the most important target is the October 28 major lower high. If the bulls break strongly above that, then the yearlong bear trend will have ended. The daily chart would then either be in a trading range or a bull trend.<li>If the bears get consecutive bear bars closing near their lows and the EURUSD trades back into the 7-week tight trading range, traders will then conclude that the recent breakout above has failed.<li>The bears see the current move as a lower high test of the bear trend line and breakout point and want the breakout above the tight trading range to fail. They then want a test and breakout below the 7-week tight trading range low followed by a continuation of the 700-pip measured move lower.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create follow-through selling and consecutive big bear bars in the last 4 weeks. The bull bars are more prominent, have bigger bodies and more closes near their highs and has a series of higher lows. The odds slightly favor the bulls in terms of buying pressure.<li>We have said that a trading range is an area of balance and a breakout mode situation. There is a 50-50% probability of a bull and bear breakout. It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse. This remains true.<li>If there is a break below the 7-week tight trading range, odds are it will be the final bear flag of the bear leg followed by a stronger reversal higher from a lower low major trend reversal, probably from slightly below June 2020 low.<li>Al has said that the EURUSD is in a 7-year trading range, so traders still expect a couple of months of sideways to up trading to begin soon.&nbsp;<li>There’s only a 30% chance that the small pullback bear trend will continue down to last year’s low without at least a rally lasting a couple of months or more.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Monthly-Jan-Bear-Bar-with-Tail-Below-Micro-Wedge-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart January Bear Bar with Tail Below, Micro Wedge Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>The January monthly Emini candlestick currently is a bear bar with a tail below after making a new high. It is the 3<sup>rd</sup>reversal since September.&nbsp;<li>December was a bull bar closing near its high therefore it is a weak sell signal bar for a strong reversal down.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a micro wedge even though January traded slightly higher first. They want January to be a failed breakout above December outside up bar, like November. A third reversal has a higher probability of working.<li>December is the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October so therefore a micro wedge. Since the bull trend is extreme, traders are looking for reasons to take some profits. A micro wedge is often a trigger for profit-taking. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down.&nbsp;<li>If January is a bear bar closing near the low, it would be a sell signal bar for February. The more this month closes on its low, the more it will attract sellers, and the more likely the Emini will pull back for a few months.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Therefore, even if there is a sharp selloff down to the October low in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of this year, it should be minor.<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months. A trading range in a bull trend is usually a bull flag. Therefore, traders should expect a bull breakout of the trading range later in the year.<li>The best the bears probably can get this year is a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>The bulls want a continuation higher to a measured move target (using the Aug-Oct trading range height) which will take them to 4930 near the top of the trend channel line. The 5000 big round number is a magnet above.<li>Can this rally continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback? That is less likely. It is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up from a double bottom bull flag and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months and not continue straight down into a bear trend. Even if it sells off for 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart.<li>Al also said that the gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-Weak-Bear-FT-Wedge-Bull-Flag-Wedge-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Weekly Chart Weak Bear Follow-through, Wedge Bull Flag, Wedge Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a bull doji. The bears failed to get strong follow-through selling from last week’s strong sell signal bar. It is a high 1 buy signal bar at the bull trend line. However, because it is a bull doji, it is a weak buy signal bar.<li>The 11-week tight trading range has higher lows (December 3, December 20, and January 10). The bulls see this as a wedge bull flag with higher lows instead of the traditional downward sloping wedge bull flag.<li>They want another strong leg up like the one from October 4 to November 5. A leg 1 = leg 2 measured move will take them to 4930 around the top of the bull channel. The 5000 big round Number is a magnet above.<li>A tight trading range is a breakout mode pattern and has a 50-50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout. It also has a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse within a couple of bars. Because it’s in a strong bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>A tight trading range late in a trend often is the final bull flag. A breakout above it may fail within 3 to 5 weeks, possibly at the top of the bull channel and possibly around the 5000 big round Number.<li>Can next week reverse higher following this week’s test of the bull trend line? The tight bull channel on the weekly chart means the bulls have been buying small pullbacks since the pandemic crash. The bull trend line has been a strong support of the tight bull channel. Until the bears break below it with consecutive big bear bars and follow-through selling, odds are traders will continue to bet on higher prices.<li>Can next week be a big bear bar closing near the low? The probability of this is slightly lower than the bull’s case. If it does, it will be a breakout below the bull trend line and increase the odds that a pullback towards the October low is underway especially if it closes below December’s low.<li>The bears want a reversal lower from a higher high double top (January 4 and November 22) or a wedge top (September 2, November 22, and January 4). They want a test of the December low followed by a measured move down which will take them to the October low.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create follow-through selling and consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows. Without that, traders would not be convinced that a deeper pullback may be developing.<li>An embedded micro wedge may be forming where the first legs up are December 10 and January 4. If we get another leg up to a new high, it would be the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg up since December. A micro wedge in a wedge top has a higher probability of leading to profit-taking pullback.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>This week’s doji bar is an area of balance. There may be some sideways trading range first before traders decide on the direction of the market.&nbsp;<li>Odds slightly favor sideways to upside more.&nbsp;</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Daily-Wedge-Bull-Flag-or-Lower-High-MTR.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-16-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart Wedge Bull Flag or Lower High MTR\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini gapped down on Monday and tested the bull trend line and the 100-day moving average but reversed back up by Wednesday to about a 50% pullback (bounce) of the early Jan bear leg.<li>Thursday formed a lower high major trend reversal lower but there was no follow-through on Friday.<li>Friday’s candlestick was a bull bar closing near its high.

Bulls also see the January 10 and 14 as a two-legged pullback from the double bottom (double bottom pullback). Bulls are hopeful the January 14 pullback goes to a new all-time high. However, even if the market gets to a new all-time high, there will probably be sellers. Bears will see any rally to a new high as an excellent opportunity to establish new shorts, confident there will be a test of the December and October 2021 lows. &nbsp;<li>Some traders see the January 14 close as the apex of a triangle, with the lows being December 20, January 10, and 14. The highs of the triangle are January 4 and 12. Notice how the January 14 close is close to the midpoint (4646.75) from the current all-time high to the &nbsp;December lows. With January 14 being a triangle in the middle of two important prices, this tells us the probably has to be very close to 50 percent for both the bulls and the bears.<li>Overall the bears still see a wedge top (September 2, November 5 or 22, and December 28). They are hopeful any rally that follows January 14 will lead to a double top lower high major trend reversal with &nbsp;January 12 and a test down to the December and October lows. Even if the bulls get a new all-time high, most bears will see the new all-time high as a wedge top and expect a two-legged selloff to the December and October lows.<li>Lastly, although a test of the December and October lows is likely in the first half of the year, traders know we are in a strong trend on the higher time frames and will expect any test of these lows to be bought.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>The Emini is currently down 40+ points from Friday’s close.<li>The bears are hopeful that the Globex selloff is the test that breaks below the January 10 lows. However, more likely, we are in a trading range, and bears will find disappointment during the day session.<li>The bears want the market to fall below Friday’s second entry buy and see it as a breakout pullback. The odds are that if the market falls below Friday’s low, it will reverse up soon after.<li>The market has been in a 20 point trading range for about 10 hours in the Globex session and will probably breakout to the upside or downside at some point today.<li>Most traders will expect a trading range open and will look to scalp until there is a strong setup like a double top or bottom, wedge top or bottom, or a strong breakout with follow-through.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-lower-low-major-trend-reversal-after-failed-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-18.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low major trend reversal after failed double top.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective.

Bulls also see the January 10 and 14 as a two-legged pullback from the double bottom (double bottom pullback). Bulls are hopeful the January 14 pullback goes to a new all-time high. However, even if the market gets to a new all-time high, there will probably be sellers. Bears will see any rally to a new high as an excellent opportunity to establish new shorts, confident there will be a test of the December and October 2021 lows. &nbsp;<li>Some traders see the January 14 close as the apex of a triangle, with the lows being December 20, January 10, and 14. The highs of the triangle are January 4 and 12. Notice how the January 14 close is close to the midpoint (4646.75) from the current all-time high to the &nbsp;December lows. With January 14 being a triangle in the middle of two important prices, this tells us the probably has to be very close to 50 percent for both the bulls and the bears.<li>Overall the bears still see a wedge top (September 2, November 5 or 22, and December 28). They are hopeful any rally that follows January 14 will lead to a double top lower high major trend reversal with &nbsp;January 12 and a test down to the December and October lows. Even if the bulls get a new all-time high, most bears will see the new all-time high as a wedge top and expect a two-legged selloff to the December and October lows.<li>Lastly, although a test of the December and October lows is likely in the first half of the year, traders know we are in a strong trend on the higher time frames and will expect any test of these lows to be bought.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>The Emini is currently down 40+ points from Friday’s close.<li>The bears are hopeful that the Globex selloff is the test that breaks below the January 10 lows. However, more likely, we are in a trading range, and bears will find disappointment during the day session.<li>The bears want the market to fall below Friday’s second entry buy and see it as a breakout pullback. The odds are that if the market falls below Friday’s low, it will reverse up soon after.<li>The market has been in a 20 point trading range for about 10 hours in the Globex session and will probably breakout to the upside or downside at some point today.<li>Most traders will expect a trading range open and will look to scalp until there is a strong setup like a double top or bottom, wedge top or bottom, or a strong breakout with follow-through.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-lower-low-major-trend-reversal-after-failed-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-18.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low major trend reversal after failed double top.

Consequently, the Emini will probably bounce, at least for a few days, from around the current level or the December 3 bottom of the range.<li>The momentum down on the daily chart is strong enough for traders to expect a break at least a little below the December 20 higher low.<li>An interesting possibility that January trades below the December 3 low, which is the December low. January would then be an outside down month after an outside up month in December.<li>That is an OO (consecutive outside bars) Breakout Mode pattern, but with January probably finishing with a bear body, a bear breakout would be more likely.<li>This would be the 2<sup>nd</sup>OO pattern in the past 5 months. If January is outside down and February goes below its low, that would trigger the OO sell signal and the micro wedge top sell signal on the monthly chart.<li>The Emini would then probably sell off for about a measured move down, based on the height of the OO (which is simply January’s range).<li>That should result in a test of the October 4 major higher low, the 20-month EMA, and the 200-day MA.<li>The selloff might reach the April 2021 gap above the March 2021 high on the monthly chart (and daily chart). That is just below 4000 and almost a 20% correction.<li>While I have been saying that the Emini would probably test the October low at some point in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the year and maybe the 1<sup>st</sup>quarter, I have also said that I thought that a 20% correction to below that monthly gap is probably the worst case for 2022 and that the Emini probably would rally later in the year.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders should look for a possible bull trend from the open or a selloff and a reversal up.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-trend-resumption-down-and-test-of-100-day-moving-average.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-19.png\" alt=\"Emini trend resumption down and test of 100 day moving average.

The breakout above the bear trend line and the 2-month tight trading range might be failing.<li>The bears want a break below the December 15 low at the bottom of the 2-month trading range and then a measured move down to below the June 19, 2020 low.<li>They hope that yesterday is a resumption of the 2021 bear trend and that the selloff continues to below the bottom of the 7-year trading range. If they get a 2<sup>nd</sup>strong bear bar today, traders will expect a break below the 2-month trading range.<li>If today is a bull bar closing near its high, the bulls will hope that it is a higher low in a new Small Pullback Bull Trend.<li>If today is not a strong bull or bear bar, the EURUSD might begin to go sideways again in its 2-month trading range.<li>If there is a break below the 2-month tight trading range, that range will more likely be the Final Bear Flag instead of a bear flag in a move down to last year’s low. That means there probably will be a reversal back up within a few weeks.<li>The odds favor a rally for a couple months before a break below the 7-year low because the monthly chart is in a trading range and legs in a trading range do not typically go straight down from the top to the bottom.<li>Traders are deciding if the rally has begun or if there will be one more leg down before it begins.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Bear-Trend-From-The-Open-and-Broad-Bear-Channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Bear Trend From The Open and Broad Bear Channel\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>The Emini gapped up to just below the open of the week, but sold off in a Bear Trend From The open.<li>It reversed up from a wedge bottom and a High 2 bottom from just below yesterday’s low.<li>After a rally that tested the open, it sold off again to below yesterday’s low.<li>It collapsed in the final hour to just above the December 20 higher low. It formed an iii pattern at the end of the day. That is a Breakout Mode pattern on the 5-minute chart.<li>The bears hope that the Emini gaps down tomorrow below that December 20 low and forms a big bear trend day.<li>The bulls hope that the selloff will reverse up from a double bottom with that low.<li>Remember, as strong as the January selloff has been, the Emini is still in a 3-month trading range.<li>In a trading range, reversals are more common than successful breakouts. Consequently, the Emini will probably bounce, at least for a few days, from around the current level or the December 3 bottom of the range.<li>The momentum down on the daily chart is strong enough for traders to expect a break at least a little below the December 20 higher low.<li>An interesting possibility that January trades below the December 3 low, which is the December low. January would then be an outside down month after an outside up month in December.<li>That is an OO (consecutive outside bars) Breakout Mode pattern, but with January probably finishing with a bear body, a bear breakout would be more likely.<li>This would be the 2<sup>nd</sup>OO pattern in the past 5 months. If January is outside down and February goes below its low, that would trigger the OO sell signal and the micro wedge top sell signal on the monthly chart.<li>The Emini would then probably sell off for about a measured move down, based on the height of the OO (which is simply January’s range).<li>That should result in a test of the October 4 major higher low, the 20-month EMA, and the 200-day MA.<li>The selloff might reach the April 2021 gap above the March 2021 high on the monthly chart (and daily chart). That is just below 4000 and almost a 20% correction.<li>While I have been saying that the Emini would probably test the October low at some point in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the year and maybe the 1<sup>st</sup>quarter, I have also said that I thought that a 20% correction to below that monthly gap is probably the worst case for 2022 and that the Emini probably would rally later in the year.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

If it is another bear day, it will confirm the breakout. That would make lower prices likely.<li>The bears want a measured move down to the October 4 low.<li>January is now an outside down bar on the monthly chart after December was an outside up bar. Consecutive outside bars is an OO (outside-outside) Breakout Mode pattern.<li>January is also a sell signal bar for the micro wedge on the monthly chart (there is an actual wedge top on the daily chart).<li>If February falls below the January low, it would trigger the OO sell signal and the micro wedge sell signal.<li>Traders would look for about a measured move down, based on the January range. Also, they would expect a test of the October low, which was the start of the wedge.<li>The selloff should test the 20-month EMA and the 200-day MA.<li>It could also test the gap on the monthly chart above the March 2021 high. That is below the 4,000 Big Round Number, and it would be about a 20% correction.<li>I have been saying that a 20% correction in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the year was about as big a selloff that the bears might get this year.<li>I also said the Emini would probably rally in the 2<sup>nd</sup>half of the year. Will it make a new high? Probably, but it is too early to tell. The Emini instead might enter a trading range for the rest of the year.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 30 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a sell climax day. There is therefore a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading today lasting at least a couple hours and beginning by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>The daily chart is the most oversold it has been since the pandemic crash. That reduces the chance of another big bear day today.<li>Traders know that most breakout attempts fail. That creates uncertainty and further reduces the chance of another big bear day today.<li>The bulls want the breakout below the 3-month range to fail. They would like today to be a strong buy signal bar. That means they want a big bull bar closing on its high. With the market as oversold as it is, that might happen.

It was a Surprise Bear Breakout which typically leads to a second leg sideways to down. The next target for the bears is the October 2020 low. Bears hope that this is the start of the bear trend. Bulls want this to simply be a sell vacuum test of the developing trading range which started in July 2021.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex was a bear inside bar with a prominent tail below. The bulls failed to get follow through buying and the EURUSD has traded back into the 7-week tight trading range. Bears need another follow-through bear bar closing near its low next week to increase the odds of a breakout below the tight trading range and a continuation of the 700-pip measured move lower. Bulls hope that this is simply a deep pullback following last week’s breakout above the tight trading range and want another leg sideways to up.<h3>The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Weekly-Bear-inside-Bar-No-Bull-Follow-Through.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-23.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Weekly Chart Bear Inside Bar No Bull Follow-through\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a bear inside bar with a prominent tail below closing below the 7-week tight trading range high. The bulls did not get follow-through buying after last week’s breakout above the trading range.<li>The prominent tail below indicates that the bears are not as strong as they could have been.&nbsp;<li>We have said that a tight trading range is an area of balance and a breakout mode situation. There is a 50-50% probability of a bull and bear breakout. It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse. It appears the breakout last week is failing.<li>The bears are hoping last week’s test of the bear trend line was simply a double top bear flag (November 30 and January 14) to be followed by a continuation of the 700-pip measured move lower.&nbsp;<li>This week’s candlestick closed slightly below the middle of the bar and is a reasonable sell signal bar for next week. Bears need follow-through selling in the next few weeks. The first targets are the higher low on January 4<sup>th</sup>followed by a test and break below the 7-week trading range low.<li>In the last 9 weeks, bears have not been able to get consecutive bear bars. If they get that next week, it increases the odds of a test of the trading range low.<li>However, a tight trading range late in a trend often is the final flag of the move. Even if there is a break below the 7-week trading range, odds are it might be the final flag of the bear leg. The EURUSD may then test below June 2020 low before there is a stronger reversal higher from a lower low major trend reversal.<li>The bulls are hoping this is simply a deep pullback following last week’s breakout. They want another leg up and a breakout above the Jan 14 high. If they get that, then the rally will probably last at least a couple of months and reach the October 28 lower high.<li>Al has been saying that there should be a sideways to up move lasting at least a couple of months. It went sideways for 2 months plus.&nbsp;<li>The EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/how-to-trade-manual/trading-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trading range</a>. The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>The next 1 to 2 weeks should provide more clarity as to whether the bears can create consecutive bear bars closing near the lows thereby increasing the odds of a breakout below the trading range or if they fail to do so thereby increasing the odds of another upside breakout attempt.</ul><h3>The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Daily-Failed-Breakout-or-Breakout-Pullback.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-23-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily Chart Failed Breakout or Breakout Pullback\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD stalled at the bear trend line last week and continued lower into the trading range this week forming another higher low on Friday<li>The bears see the current move as a failed breakout above the 7-week tight trading range and a lower high test of the bear trend line and breakout point.

They want another leg higher and breakout above the January 14 high towards the November 10 and October 28 lower high above.<li>So, which is more likely? We have said that a trading range is an area of balance and a breakout mode situation. There is a 50-50% probability of a bull and bear breakout. It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse. So far, the first breakout above reversed back into the trading range.&nbsp;<li>Traders need more information therefore more bars on the chart before they decide on the next breakout of the trading range.<li>Al has said that the EURUSD would probably not continue down to last year’s low without first going sideways to up for a couple of months and it went sideways for 2 months plus. Is that enough of a correction for the selloff to continue straight down? The bears have a 40% chance.<li>It is more likely that either the current bull breakout will continue up or that a break below the 7-week tight trading range will reverse up within a few weeks from a final bear flag. The odds still favor that the EURUSD would rally for a couple of months.&nbsp;</ul><h2>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3>The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Monthly-Jan-OO-Outside-Outside-Bear-Bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-23-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart January Outside-Outside Bear Bar\"></a></figure><ul><li>The January monthly Emini candlestick currently is an outside down bar after an outside up December. This is an OO (outside-outside) pattern, which means Breakout Mode. It is the 3<sup>rd</sup>reversal since September therefore a micro wedge.<li>We have said that the bears want a reversal lower from a micro wedge even though January traded slightly higher first. They want January to be a failed breakout above December outside up bar, like November. A third reversal has a higher probability of working.<li>Al said that the current OO pattern follows an OO pattern in October. Consecutive attempts at a top in a buy climax have an increased chance of a reversal down. January is the sell signal bar for the OO. If February or March trades below the January low, it would trigger the OO sell signal. The minimum target is a measured move based on the height of the OO, which is January’s range.&nbsp;<li>That would lead to a test down to the October 3 low and possibly the gap above the March 2021 high on the monthly chart. That is also just below the 4000 Big Round Number.<li>There are another 6 trading days left in the month. It is probably too far for the bulls to trade above the open of the month. The bulls want to prevent the month from closing near the low. At the very least, they want a close above the middle of the month’s range around 4600. That is also the middle of the 3-month trading range therefore a magnet.<li>If they get that, January will have a prominent tail below and indicates the bears are not as strong as they would like to be.<li>The bulls want a continuation higher to a measured move target (using the Aug-Oct trading range height) which will take them to 4930 near the top of the trend channel line. However, if January closes near the low, the odds of this happening in February or March is less likely.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Therefore, even if there is a sharp selloff down to the October low in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of this year, it should be minor. Even if it sells off for a 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart and not continue straight down into a bear trend.&nbsp;<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months to around a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number.&nbsp;<li>A trading range in a bull trend is usually a bull flag. Therefore, traders should expect a bull breakout of the trading range later in the year.<li>We have said that this rally is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming which makes it less likely it will continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback.&nbsp;<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months. It may have already begun.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low or slightly lower, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up from a double bottom bull flag and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months.&nbsp;<li>The gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3>The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-BO-below-Bull-Trend-Line-Dec-Low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-23-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Weekly Chart Breakout below Bull Trend Line and December Low. Emini surprise bear breakout.\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a big surprise bear breakout bar closing near the low breaking far below the bull trend line and December’s low. It is a strong sell signal bar for next week and it may gap down at the open on Monday. Small gaps usually close early.<li>The bears need next week to be another bear follow-through bar to confirm the breakout below the bull trend line.<li>Al said that if there is a gap down and the bears keep it open for a couple of weeks, it could become a measuring gap. With this week’s low at about 400 points below the all-time high, a measured move down would be around the 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>The bulls hope the breakout is just a bear trap. They want a strong bull reversal bar next week even though next week might trade slightly lower first possibly from a double bottom bull flag with October low which is also around the 50-week moving average.<li>With this week closing near the low, odds are the Emini should trade at least slightly lower.&nbsp;<li>Al said that there is often a reversal up after a breakout. Therefore, the Emini might rally strongly for a week or two.&nbsp;<li>A 50% retracement of the selloff will bring the Emini back into the middle of the 3-month trading range around 4600 which is a magnet above.<li>However, the selloff has been strong and was a Surprise Bear Breakout which usually has a second leg sideways to down after a pullback (bounce).&nbsp;<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>The Surprise Bear Breakout may have increased the odds of a correction back to 50% or just slightly more. Typically, the correction is already half over by the time traders realize it is underway.<li>However, the best the bears probably can get this year is a 20% correction down to around the 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>For now, the bears need another follow-through bear bar next week to confirm the breakout below the bull trend line.&nbsp;<li>If next week is a big bull bar closing near the high, especially above this week’s high, it would be a high 1 buy signal bar from a twin reversal bar setup.</ul><h3>The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Daily-Bear-Follow-through-Test-of-200-Day-MA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-23-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Report Bear Follow-through Test of 200-day Moving Average\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini broke below the 100-day MA and the bull trend line to test the 200-day moving average. This was the first time the 200-day MA was tested since June 2020.<li>The selloff from the wedge top is strong enough for traders to expect at least a second leg sideways to down move.<li>This week broke below December’s low. The Emini is now in a trading range that started in July 2021.&nbsp;<li>The next target for the bears is the October low. It may reach there soon. The bears hope that this is the start of the bear trend.<li>Al has said that since the 200-day MA is important support, the Emini might rally sharply for a few days next week, especially after 4 big bear days.<li>The bulls hope that this selloff was simply a sell vacuum test of the trading range low which started in July 2021. As strong as the selling is, they want the selloff to simply be a bear leg in the developing 6-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>They then want a double bottom bull flag with October low and a rally to re-test the trend extreme.<li>However, there is a 7-bar bear microchannel since January 12 and the move down from the high is in a tight bear channel which means strong selling. Bulls will need at least a micro double bottom or a strong bull reversal bar closing near its high before they would be willing to buy aggressively.&nbsp;<li>Since Friday was a bear bar closing near the low, Monday may gap down at the open. Small gaps usually close early in the week.<li>Al said that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. Trading ranges often begin before bull or bear trends end.&nbsp;<li>For the Emini to evolve into a trading range, it needs a bear leg. Once the bear legs start to fall below prior lows, like the December 3 low, traders will conclude that the bull trend has evolved into a trading range. The Emini should then fall to the October low or slightly lower. So far this remains true.<li>However, it will probably form a double bottom bull flag with one of those significant prior lows instead of continuing down into a bear trend.</ul><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was a Surprise Bear Breakout which typically leads to a second leg sideways to down. The next target for the bears is the October 2020 low. Bears hope that this is the start of the bear trend. Bulls want this to simply be a sell vacuum test of the developing trading range which started in July 2021.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex was a bear inside bar with a prominent tail below. The bulls failed to get follow through buying and the EURUSD has traded back into the 7-week tight trading range. Bears need another follow-through bear bar closing near its low next week to increase the odds of a breakout below the tight trading range and a continuation of the 700-pip measured move lower. Bulls hope that this is simply a deep pullback following last week’s breakout above the tight trading range and want another leg sideways to up.<h3>The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Weekly-Bear-inside-Bar-No-Bull-Follow-Through.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-23.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Weekly Chart Bear Inside Bar No Bull Follow-through\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a bear inside bar with a prominent tail below closing below the 7-week tight trading range high. The bulls did not get follow-through buying after last week’s breakout above the trading range.<li>The prominent tail below indicates that the bears are not as strong as they could have been.&nbsp;<li>We have said that a tight trading range is an area of balance and a breakout mode situation. There is a 50-50% probability of a bull and bear breakout. It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse. It appears the breakout last week is failing.<li>The bears are hoping last week’s test of the bear trend line was simply a double top bear flag (November 30 and January 14) to be followed by a continuation of the 700-pip measured move lower.&nbsp;<li>This week’s candlestick closed slightly below the middle of the bar and is a reasonable sell signal bar for next week. Bears need follow-through selling in the next few weeks. The first targets are the higher low on January 4<sup>th</sup>followed by a test and break below the 7-week trading range low.<li>In the last 9 weeks, bears have not been able to get consecutive bear bars. If they get that next week, it increases the odds of a test of the trading range low.<li>However, a tight trading range late in a trend often is the final flag of the move. Even if there is a break below the 7-week trading range, odds are it might be the final flag of the bear leg. The EURUSD may then test below June 2020 low before there is a stronger reversal higher from a lower low major trend reversal.<li>The bulls are hoping this is simply a deep pullback following last week’s breakout. They want another leg up and a breakout above the Jan 14 high. If they get that, then the rally will probably last at least a couple of months and reach the October 28 lower high.<li>Al has been saying that there should be a sideways to up move lasting at least a couple of months. It went sideways for 2 months plus.&nbsp;<li>The EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/how-to-trade-manual/trading-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trading range</a>. The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>The next 1 to 2 weeks should provide more clarity as to whether the bears can create consecutive bear bars closing near the lows thereby increasing the odds of a breakout below the trading range or if they fail to do so thereby increasing the odds of another upside breakout attempt.</ul><h3>The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Daily-Failed-Breakout-or-Breakout-Pullback.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-23-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily Chart Failed Breakout or Breakout Pullback\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD stalled at the bear trend line last week and continued lower into the trading range this week forming another higher low on Friday<li>The bears see the current move as a failed breakout above the 7-week tight trading range and a lower high test of the bear trend line and breakout point. They want a test and breakout below the 7-week tight trading range low followed by a continuation of the 700-pip measured move lower.<li>They were able to get consecutive bear bars and follow-through selling on Mon-Tues.

That is also just below the 4000 Big Round Number.<li>There are another 6 trading days left in the month. It is probably too far for the bulls to trade above the open of the month. The bulls want to prevent the month from closing near the low. At the very least, they want a close above the middle of the month’s range around 4600. That is also the middle of the 3-month trading range therefore a magnet.<li>If they get that, January will have a prominent tail below and indicates the bears are not as strong as they would like to be.<li>The bulls want a continuation higher to a measured move target (using the Aug-Oct trading range height) which will take them to 4930 near the top of the trend channel line. However, if January closes near the low, the odds of this happening in February or March is less likely.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Therefore, even if there is a sharp selloff down to the October low in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of this year, it should be minor. Even if it sells off for a 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart and not continue straight down into a bear trend.&nbsp;<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months to around a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number.&nbsp;<li>A trading range in a bull trend is usually a bull flag. Therefore, traders should expect a bull breakout of the trading range later in the year.<li>We have said that this rally is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming which makes it less likely it will continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback.&nbsp;<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months. It may have already begun.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low or slightly lower, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up from a double bottom bull flag and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months.&nbsp;<li>The gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3>The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-BO-below-Bull-Trend-Line-Dec-Low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-23-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Weekly Chart Breakout below Bull Trend Line and December Low.

A strong reversal up.<li>Bulls are hoping the selloff from January 4 to yesterday’s bull reversal bar is a large 2nd leg trap that will lead to a new all-time high.<li>Bears see yesterday’s rally as profit-taking after an oversold market testing obvious support (October 2021 low).<li>The market is clearly in a trading range on the daily chart. As yesterday’s bull reversal bar looks, traders will expect the bulls to be disappointed soon, just like the bears were disappointed with yesterday’s bull reversal bar.<li>Trading ranges typically have deep pullbacks that test breakout points, such as the December 2021 Lows. Some bulls bought the December lows, confident that they could avoid a loss if they used a wide stop and scaled in lower. The above reason makes me think the market will have to get back to the December low soon. &nbsp;<li>Yesterday’s bull reversal bar damages the market’s odds going a lot lower before there is a deep rally testing the December lows. The odds are that the market will get a 2nd leg down from the selloff that started on January 12. If the 2nd leg falls below the January 24 low, the market will probably find buyers below.<li>Most bears will probably exit around this price level and see any selloff today as a gift to buy back their shorts at a better price than yesterday’s close. The selloff over the past two weeks has created a strong trendline break. Traders will expect a rally, which could rally much further than the bears want. Trading ranges usually have deep pullbacks following strong moves, so I think most bears will look to take profits rather than stay short. Once the market has a few legs up, bears will look to establish new short positions assuming the rally is not too strong.<li>It is important to remember that as strong as this selloff is, it is a bull flag on the weekly and monthly charts. The October low is likely to be a minor reversal on the weekly chart, and bulls see it as a great opportunity to buy, which they did yesterday. &nbsp;</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 67 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>While that is many points down, it is not even a 50% pullback of yesterday’s bull reversal bar.<li>The odds are that the bears will use this overnight selloff as a way to buy back their shorts at a better price.<li>The pre-market selloff looks like a bear leg in a trading range, which makes me think the open may rally.<li>While I expect a bull rally on the open, I also expect the bulls to be disappointed today after a strong bull reversal bar yesterday. Trading ranges are notorious for causing disappointment which makes traders question the setup in front of them, such as buying above yesterday’s bull reversal bar. If today is a weak entry bar for the bulls or a bear inside bar, it will make traders question the probability of buying above yesterday.<li>As with most days, traders will expect a trading range open and look for a swing trade with a breakout or a &nbsp;second entry buy or sell setup.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-midday-trend-reversal-from-below-october-low-and-200-day-moving-average.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-25.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and midday trend strong reversal up from below october low and 200 day moving average\"></a></figure><p>Al created the SP500 Emini charts.<p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

A strong reversal up.<li>Bulls are hoping the selloff from January 4 to yesterday’s bull reversal bar is a large 2nd leg trap that will lead to a new all-time high.<li>Bears see yesterday’s rally as profit-taking after an oversold market testing obvious support (October 2021 low).<li>The market is clearly in a trading range on the daily chart. As yesterday’s bull reversal bar looks, traders will expect the bulls to be disappointed soon, just like the bears were disappointed with yesterday’s bull reversal bar.<li>Trading ranges typically have deep pullbacks that test breakout points, such as the December 2021 Lows. Some bulls bought the December lows, confident that they could avoid a loss if they used a wide stop and scaled in lower. The above reason makes me think the market will have to get back to the December low soon. &nbsp;<li>Yesterday’s bull reversal bar damages the market’s odds going a lot lower before there is a deep rally testing the December lows. The odds are that the market will get a 2nd leg down from the selloff that started on January 12. If the 2nd leg falls below the January 24 low, the market will probably find buyers below.<li>Most bears will probably exit around this price level and see any selloff today as a gift to buy back their shorts at a better price than yesterday’s close. The selloff over the past two weeks has created a strong trendline break. Traders will expect a rally, which could rally much further than the bears want. Trading ranges usually have deep pullbacks following strong moves, so I think most bears will look to take profits rather than stay short. Once the market has a few legs up, bears will look to establish new short positions assuming the rally is not too strong.<li>It is important to remember that as strong as this selloff is, it is a bull flag on the weekly and monthly charts. The October low is likely to be a minor reversal on the weekly chart, and bulls see it as a great opportunity to buy, which they did yesterday. &nbsp;</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 67 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>While that is many points down, it is not even a 50% pullback of yesterday’s bull reversal bar.<li>The odds are that the bears will use this overnight selloff as a way to buy back their shorts at a better price.<li>The pre-market selloff looks like a bear leg in a trading range, which makes me think the open may rally.<li>While I expect a bull rally on the open, I also expect the bulls to be disappointed today after a strong bull reversal bar yesterday. Trading ranges are notorious for causing disappointment which makes traders question the setup in front of them, such as buying above yesterday’s bull reversal bar. If today is a weak entry bar for the bulls or a bear inside bar, it will make traders question the probability of buying above yesterday.<li>As with most days, traders will expect a trading range open and look for a swing trade with a breakout or a &nbsp;second entry buy or sell setup.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-midday-trend-reversal-from-below-october-low-and-200-day-moving-average.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-25.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and midday trend strong reversal up from below october low and 200 day moving average\"></a></figure><p>Al created the SP500 Emini charts.<p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-January-25-2022-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-25-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD is currently trying to break below the January lows.<li>The bears are hopeful they can get a strong bear close today, demonstrating more follow-through after the 3-day bear breakout ending on January 18. They are hopeful this selloff will break below the November 2021 lows.<li>Even if the bears get below the November lows, traders will likely see the bear breakout as a final flag reversal setup and look for reasons to buy.<li>The selloff from January 14 is likely in a tight enough channel that the first reversal up will probably fail, and the market will have to go sideways, forming at least some kind of a double bottom.<li>So far, today is a big bear bar. However, when you look to the left, it is a trading range, which makes the odds higher that something will be disappointing for the bears either today or tomorrow.<li>The bears need to get a decent close today and follow through to convince traders that the selloff may reach the November 2021 low.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-close-at-open-so-doji-day-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini close at open so doji day and trading range day\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Today gapped down and formed a parabolic wedge bottom 7:10.<li>The first 9 bars of the day were in a tight bear channel, so the odds were the first reversal up would be minor and likely go sideways.<li>The market ended up forming a parabolic wedge lower high at 7:50. Traders had to be open to the possibility of a trading range for most of the day.<li>The market formed a triangle, and the bears tried several times to break below and failed, so traders had to be open to the possibility of an upside breakout testing the 60-minute moving average and Yesterday’s high (buy a signal bar on the daily chart).<li>By 10:35, the bulls achieved a bull breakout with follow-through, and it was a &nbsp;buy the close bull rally.<li>Traders had to be open to the idea of a bull breakout above the bar 1 high and a possible measured move up from the low of the day to the open of the day, which was achieved at 12:00. At this point, the open was around the middle of the day’s range, so traders had to be aware of a possible selloff testing the open of the day.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Emini pausing after sell climax.<li>Yesterday was a doji inside day. It is a High 2 buy signal bar for the bulls and a Low 1 sell signal bar for the bears. But a doji bar is a low probability signal bar, which reduces the probability of a big move today above it or below it.<li>If today or tomorrow goes above yesterday’s high and especially above Monday’s high, the Emini will trigger the buy signal.<li>For the bears, yesterday is a Low 1 sell signal bar in a strong bear trend. But after Monday’s big reversal up at the bottom of a trading range, there probably will be buyers either below yesterday’s low or below Monday’s low. The chance of a continued collapse this week is small.<li>Traders should expect the Emini to start to go sideways to up soon for at least a week or two.<li>The January wedge top will probably get at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down. Therefore traders will look to sell again after a bounce of at least several days.<li>The bounce will probably go back above the December low since that was a major breakout point. It might retrace 50% of January’s selloff.<li>The bears hope Monday was a bull trap and that the collapse resumes today. A reversal up from a sell climax is likely before the Emini falls much below Monday’s low.<li>The open of the week could be a magnet all week. The bears want a follow-through bear bar, especially one closing near its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<li>The bulls want the week to close on its high.

The December 20 low was a major breakout point. There is a 60% chance that there will be a rally to above that low within a week.<li>With the 2-day micro bottom and consecutive bull bars, there is an increased chance of a reversal up that could last a couple weeks. That increases the chance of a bull trend day.<li>However, after a sell climax, the market often goes sideways for 5 to 10 bars before deciding on its next direction. That increases the chance of a reversal back down early today.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, there will be an increased chance of a trend.<li>If most of the early bars have prominent tails and there are a lot of reversals, the odds will favor a trading range day.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-close-at-open-so-doji-day-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-26.png\" alt=\"Emini close at open so doji day and trading range day.

An Emini low 1 sell signal.<li>Since yesterday was an inside day, it is both a buy and sell signal bar. However, it was a big bear bar closing near its low in a bear trend. It is a low probability buy signal.<li>It is also a sell signal bar. But it is coming after Monday’s big reversal up from below the 6-month range and it is in a tight trading range. That reduces the probability of a big move down. There might be more buyers than sellers below its low and below Monday’s low.<li>With the huge swings up and down, traders should be prepared for anything.<li>While there could be a big breakout up or down today, after 4 sideways days.<li>However, all 4 days have oscillated around the open of the week. Traders therefore see that as an important magnet. That increases the chance that today will try to close around the open of the week. That and 4 sideways days increase the chance of a 5<sup>th</sup>consecutive sideways day.<li>After the strong reversal down from the wedge top on the daily chart, traders will sell the 1<sup>st</sup>1 – 3 week rally.<li>That lower high will create a head and shoulders top. All tops have about a 40% chance of some kind of measured move down. There is a 60% chance that the market will be mostly sideways and eventually will resume the 2-year bull trend.<li>Monday is the final trading day in January. January is going to have a bear body on the monthly chart.<li>December is an outside down month. The bulls have been strong for 2 years. They will try to get the month to close above the December low. Since that is 200 points above, it is probably too far to reach in 2 trading days.<li>The more January closes on its low, the more likely February will trade lower.<li>The more January closes in its middle, the more likely February will be more sideways.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 1 point in the overnight Globex session, and very close to the open of the week.<li>It will open in the middle of 4 sideways days and at the open of the week. That increases the chance that today will be another sideways day.<li>But even if it is, the daily ranges have been huge. Therefore, there should be at least one swing trade in each direction.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, there would be an increased chance of a trend day. Currently, a trading range day is more likely.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-wedge-top-then-bear-trending-trading-range-day-and-inside-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-28.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top then bear trending trading range day and inside day.

As was likely, there were more buyers below, despite the Low 1 sell signal on the daily chart.<li>After rallying for a couple hours, the Emini reversed back down to the open of the week, which has been an important magnet every day this week.<li>It then rallied to close near the high. Today is a good High 2 buy signal bar on the daily chart.<li>Today was the 5<sup>th</sup>day in a tight trading range at the bottom of a 6-month trading range. If the Emini can’t go down, it will probably try the other direction.<li>The extreme sell climax reversed up strongly on Monday from the October low at the bottom of the 6-month trading range.<li>The bears were unable to continue down all week<li>The Emini should rally for at least a week or two. The minimum target is the December low. Other targets are a 50% pullback. Less likely, it will continue up in a Small Pullback Bull Trend to a new high without more than a 3-day pullback (V-bottom).<li>The bulls would like to reach the December low before Monday’s close. January probably will close around that level, which means Monday should rally.<li>January is the 2<sup>nd</sup>bar of consecutive outside bars on the monthly chart. It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar.<li>With the micro wedge and the 2<sup>nd</sup>attempt to reverse down, it is more likely that February will trade below the January low. That would trigger the sell signal and lead to another month or two down, maybe to around 4,000.<li>However, January will probably have a big tail on the bottom, and that lowers the chance of a big selloff in February.<li>If January closes in the middle of its range, which is likely, it will increase the chance that February will be mostly sideways, even though the Emini should rally next week.<li>If Russia invades the Ukraine and if Europe messes it up, the stock market could fall to the pre-pandemic high before going up.<li>But Putin will not consider an invasion until mid-February since he will lose China’s support if he invades during the China Olympics. That absence of danger for a couple weeks should lead to a rally.<li>But even if February triggers the monthly OO sell signal, the Emini should bounce for at least a couple weeks in early February. Traders should then expect a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down later in the month, assuming the rally does not go straight up to a new high.<li>With the cluster of magnets around 4,000, that is a reasonable target area for the bottom of the correction if the Emini reverses down from a lower high.<li>The odds favor a resumption up at the end of the year. However, trading ranges can last a long time. Therefore, the current 6-month range could last all year, and the bull breakout might not come until next year.<li>The week closed near its high. It is a buy signal bar for a lower low double bottom with the October low. The Emini should trigger the weekly buy signal, in addition to the daily buy signal, next week.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

An Emini low 1 sell signal.<li>Since yesterday was an inside day, it is both a buy and sell signal bar. However, it was a big bear bar closing near its low in a bear trend. It is a low probability buy signal.<li>It is also a sell signal bar. But it is coming after Monday’s big reversal up from below the 6-month range and it is in a tight trading range. That reduces the probability of a big move down. There might be more buyers than sellers below its low and below Monday’s low.<li>With the huge swings up and down, traders should be prepared for anything.<li>While there could be a big breakout up or down today, after 4 sideways days.<li>However, all 4 days have oscillated around the open of the week. Traders therefore see that as an important magnet. That increases the chance that today will try to close around the open of the week. That and 4 sideways days increase the chance of a 5<sup>th</sup>consecutive sideways day.<li>After the strong reversal down from the wedge top on the daily chart, traders will sell the 1<sup>st</sup>1 – 3 week rally.<li>That lower high will create a head and shoulders top. All tops have about a 40% chance of some kind of measured move down. There is a 60% chance that the market will be mostly sideways and eventually will resume the 2-year bull trend.<li>Monday is the final trading day in January. January is going to have a bear body on the monthly chart.<li>December is an outside down month. The bulls have been strong for 2 years. They will try to get the month to close above the December low. Since that is 200 points above, it is probably too far to reach in 2 trading days.<li>The more January closes on its low, the more likely February will trade lower.<li>The more January closes in its middle, the more likely February will be more sideways.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 1 point in the overnight Globex session, and very close to the open of the week.<li>It will open in the middle of 4 sideways days and at the open of the week. That increases the chance that today will be another sideways day.<li>But even if it is, the daily ranges have been huge. Therefore, there should be at least one swing trade in each direction.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, there would be an increased chance of a trend day. Currently, a trading range day is more likely.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-wedge-top-then-bear-trending-trading-range-day-and-inside-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-28.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top then bear trending trading range day and inside day.

Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-below-trading-range-and-possible-final-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-28-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex breakout below trading range and possible final bear flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD Forex market broke strongly below the 9-week trading range yesterday.<br>It also broke below the June 19, 2020 higher low, which was the start of the 2020 bull channel.<li>The bears want a 200-pip measured move down.<li>They hope the yearlong bear trend will continue down to the 2020 low and then below the bottom of the 7-year trading range.<li>Yesterday was a Bear Surprise Bar.

As was likely, there were more buyers below, despite the Low 1 sell signal on the daily chart.<li>After rallying for a couple hours, the Emini reversed back down to the open of the week, which has been an important magnet every day this week.<li>It then rallied to close near the high. Today is a good High 2 buy signal bar on the daily chart.<li>Today was the 5<sup>th</sup>day in a tight trading range at the bottom of a 6-month trading range. If the Emini can’t go down, it will probably try the other direction.<li>The extreme sell climax reversed up strongly on Monday from the October low at the bottom of the 6-month trading range.<li>The bears were unable to continue down all week<li>The Emini should rally for at least a week or two. The minimum target is the December low. Other targets are a 50% pullback. Less likely, it will continue up in a Small Pullback Bull Trend to a new high without more than a 3-day pullback (V-bottom).<li>The bulls would like to reach the December low before Monday’s close. January probably will close around that level, which means Monday should rally.<li>January is the 2<sup>nd</sup>bar of consecutive outside bars on the monthly chart. It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar.<li>With the micro wedge and the 2<sup>nd</sup>attempt to reverse down, it is more likely that February will trade below the January low. That would trigger the sell signal and lead to another month or two down, maybe to around 4,000.<li>However, January will probably have a big tail on the bottom, and that lowers the chance of a big selloff in February.<li>If January closes in the middle of its range, which is likely, it will increase the chance that February will be mostly sideways, even though the Emini should rally next week.<li>If Russia invades the Ukraine and if Europe messes it up, the stock market could fall to the pre-pandemic high before going up.<li>But Putin will not consider an invasion until mid-February since he will lose China’s support if he invades during the China Olympics. That absence of danger for a couple weeks should lead to a rally.<li>But even if February triggers the monthly OO sell signal, the Emini should bounce for at least a couple weeks in early February. Traders should then expect a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down later in the month, assuming the rally does not go straight up to a new high.<li>With the cluster of magnets around 4,000, that is a reasonable target area for the bottom of the correction if the Emini reverses down from a lower high.<li>The odds favor a resumption up at the end of the year. However, trading ranges can last a long time. Therefore, the current 6-month range could last all year, and the bull breakout might not come until next year.<li>The week closed near its high. It is a buy signal bar for a lower low double bottom with the October low. The Emini should trigger the weekly buy signal, in addition to the daily buy signal, next week.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Monday is the last trading day of the month. Bulls want a strong close above the middle of the monthly candlestick around 4500. Bears want the month to close near the low to increase the odds of February trading at least slightly lower. The 4-week selloff is strong enough for traders to expect at least a small sideways to down leg after a pullback (bounce). Less likely, we will get a small pullback trend that goes all the way up to the trend extreme.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market had a strong breakout below the 7-week tight trading range this week. The 9-week sideways to up trading relieved some of the prior oversold condition, and bears are now more confident about selling again. The bulls want the 7-week tight trading range to be the final bear flag of the bear leg. However, the bulls will need to do more by creating consecutive bull bars closing near their highs to convince traders that the breakout below the tight trading range will fail.<h2 id=\"1-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Monthly-Jan-OO-Bear-Bar-with-Tail-Below.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-30.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart January OO Bear Bar with Tail Below\"></a></figure><ul><li>The January monthly Emini candlestick currently is an outside down bar after an outside up December. This is an OO (outside-outside) pattern, which means Breakout Mode. January is both a buy and a sell signal bar.<li>The Emini tested the bottom of the 6-month trading range but reversed back higher. There is a prominent tail below the candlestick which means the bears are not as strong as they would like to be.<li>Monday is the last trading day of the month. The bulls want a close above the December low and above the middle of the month around 4510. It is attainable if they can get a strong rally on Monday.<li>The bears want January to close near the low. However, the bears repeated attempts to create follow-through selling this week failed. If the Emini can’t go down, it will probably try the other direction.<li>Al said that the current OO pattern follows an OO pattern in October. Consecutive attempts at a top in a buy climax have an increased chance of a reversal down. January is the sell signal bar for the OO. If February trades below the January low, it will trigger the OO sell signal.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a breakout below January and a measured move based on the height of the OO which will take them to around 3600.<li>However, if January closes above the middle of the bar and above December’s low, it will have a long tail below. That is a weak sell signal bar. Selling below a weak sell signal bar at the bottom of a 6-month trading range may be risky if more traders think the trading range is more important and would, therefore, BLSH (Buy Low Sell High).<li>The bears will need February to close as another bear follow-through bar below January’s low to convince traders that a deeper correction is underway.<li>The bulls see the current move as a long-overdue pullback. They want a reversal higher from a double bottom bull flag with October low and a retest of the trend extreme and a subsequent breakout to a new high.<li>So, Monday is an important day as it would result in either January being a bearish bar or a neutral to a slightly bullish bar.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Therefore, even if there is a sharp selloff down to the October low in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of this year, it should be minor. Even if it sells off for a 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart and not continue straight down into a bear trend.&nbsp;<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months to around a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number<li>We have said that this rally is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming which makes it less likely that it will continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback. January is the pullback.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months. The trading range may have already begun from July 2020.<li>Al has said that the bull trend<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from the pandemic crash</a>has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months.&nbsp;<li>The gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3 id=\"3-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-Bull-Reversal-Bar-from-50-Week-MA-Oct-Low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-30-1.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Bull Reversal Bar from 50-week MA and October Low.

It closed near the high and above last week’s close.&nbsp;<li>The bears failed to get follow-through selling following last week’s strong bear breakout.<li>Since this week is a strong bull reversal bar, it is a strong buy signal bar for next week. Should the Emini trade below this week’s low, odds are there will be buyers below.<li>The bears want a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce) from a lower high major trend reversal. It would then be a reversal lower from head &amp; shoulders (H&amp;S) top where the lower high is the right shoulder.<li>The bears want the pullback (bounce) to have overlapping bars with bear bars closing near the lows and weak bull bars. If they get that, the odds of a strong second leg lower increases.<li>However, a H&amp;S top often is a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>push down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>Last week, we said that the bulls want a strong bull reversal bar even though the Emini might trade slightly lower first possibly from a double bottom bull flag with October low which is also around the 50-week moving average. They got that this week.<li>The bulls see the selloff in the last 4 weeks as a bear trap and a sell vacuum test of the bottom of the 6-month trading range. Since this week closed near the high, next week may gap up at the open. Small gaps usually close early.&nbsp;<li>The bulls want a strong follow-through bar closing near the high. If they get that, odds are the week after should trade at least slightly higher still. If the bulls get consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in the next 1 to 3 weeks, we may get another strong leg up like the one from the October 2021 low. However, keep in mind that V bottoms are rare and less likely.<li>The minimum targets for the bulls are the December low or a 50% pullback of the selloff around 4510.<li>The selloff in the last 4 weeks was strong enough that traders expect at least a small second leg sideways to down after a pullback (bounce). If the bulls get consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in the next 1 to 3 weeks instead, it can lead to a retest of the trend extreme.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>The Surprise Bear Breakout last week may have increased the odds of a correction back to 50% or just slightly more, but the bears failed to get follow-through selling below the bottom of the 6-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that the best the bears probably can get this year is a 20% correction down to around the 4,000 Big Round Number. This remains true.<li>For now, next week should trade at least slightly higher. Whether the bulls get a strong follow-through bar next week or not will be a piece of key information.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Daily-Bull-Reversal-Bar-Double-Bottom-Bull-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-30-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Daily Chart Bull Reversal Bar, Double Bottom Bull Flag?\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini gapped down far below the 200-day moving average on Monday and traded below October low but reversed back up to close as a strong bull reversal bar. The bulls however did not get follow-through buying on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Emini traded sideways in a tight trading range instead.&nbsp;<li>Friday triggered the low 1 sell signal bar but reversed higher to close near the week’s high as an outside bull bar around the 200-day moving average. It is a good high 2 bull signal bar for Monday. Since Friday closed near the week’s high, next week may gap up at the open. Small gaps usually close early.<li>The bulls see the recent selloff as a sell vacuum test of the trading range low which started in July 2021. As strong as the selling is, they want the selloff to simply be a bear leg in the developing 6-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>Bulls then want a double bottom bull flag with October low and a rally to re-test the trend extreme.<li>The selloff from the wedge top was stronger than all prior pullbacks since the pandemic crash. The move down from the high is in a tight bear channel which means strong selling.<li>Odds favor a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce), probably from a lower high around the December low and the 100-day moving average which also happens to be a 50% pullback of the selloff just above 4500.<li>The bears then want a reversal from a lower high which will be the right shoulder of a H&amp;S (head &amp; shoulders) top. They then want a strong break below the 6-month trading range and a measured move down to around 3600 based on the height of the 6-month trading range.<li>However, a H&amp;S top is often a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>leg down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>push down in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>Less likely, the pullback (bounce) will turn into a small pullback bull trend testing the trend extreme like the one in October. However, if the bulls get a series of consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in a tight bull channel, it can change the odds in the bull’s favor.<li>Al said that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. By trading below October low, traders concluded that the bull trend has evolved into a trading range.<li>A trading range in a strong bull trend eventually turns into a bull flag instead of leading into a bear trend. The odds favor a continuation of the trend making a new high probably in the second half of the year.&nbsp;<li>For now, there may be a bounce following recent oversold conditions.

Monday is the last trading day of the month. Bulls want a strong close above the middle of the monthly candlestick around 4500. Bears want the month to close near the low to increase the odds of February trading at least slightly lower. The 4-week selloff is strong enough for traders to expect at least a small sideways to down leg after a pullback (bounce). Less likely, we will get a small pullback trend that goes all the way up to the trend extreme.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market had a strong breakout below the 7-week tight trading range this week. The 9-week sideways to up trading relieved some of the prior oversold condition, and bears are now more confident about selling again. The bulls want the 7-week tight trading range to be the final bear flag of the bear leg. However, the bulls will need to do more by creating consecutive bull bars closing near their highs to convince traders that the breakout below the tight trading range will fail.<h2 id=\"1-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Monthly-Jan-OO-Bear-Bar-with-Tail-Below.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-30.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart January OO Bear Bar with Tail Below\"></a></figure><ul><li>The January monthly Emini candlestick currently is an outside down bar after an outside up December. This is an OO (outside-outside) pattern, which means Breakout Mode. January is both a buy and a sell signal bar.<li>The Emini tested the bottom of the 6-month trading range but reversed back higher. There is a prominent tail below the candlestick which means the bears are not as strong as they would like to be.<li>Monday is the last trading day of the month. The bulls want a close above the December low and above the middle of the month around 4510. It is attainable if they can get a strong rally on Monday.<li>The bears want January to close near the low. However, the bears repeated attempts to create follow-through selling this week failed. If the Emini can’t go down, it will probably try the other direction.<li>Al said that the current OO pattern follows an OO pattern in October. Consecutive attempts at a top in a buy climax have an increased chance of a reversal down. January is the sell signal bar for the OO. If February trades below the January low, it will trigger the OO sell signal.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a breakout below January and a measured move based on the height of the OO which will take them to around 3600.<li>However, if January closes above the middle of the bar and above December’s low, it will have a long tail below. That is a weak sell signal bar. Selling below a weak sell signal bar at the bottom of a 6-month trading range may be risky if more traders think the trading range is more important and would, therefore, BLSH (Buy Low Sell High).<li>The bears will need February to close as another bear follow-through bar below January’s low to convince traders that a deeper correction is underway.<li>The bulls see the current move as a long-overdue pullback. They want a reversal higher from a double bottom bull flag with October low and a retest of the trend extreme and a subsequent breakout to a new high.<li>So, Monday is an important day as it would result in either January being a bearish bar or a neutral to a slightly bullish bar.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Therefore, even if there is a sharp selloff down to the October low in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of this year, it should be minor. Even if it sells off for a 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart and not continue straight down into a bear trend.&nbsp;<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months to around a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number<li>We have said that this rally is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming which makes it less likely that it will continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback. January is the pullback.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months. The trading range may have already begun from July 2020.<li>Al has said that the bull trend<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from the pandemic crash</a>has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months.&nbsp;<li>The gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3 id=\"3-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Weekly-Bull-Reversal-Bar-from-50-Week-MA-Oct-Low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-30-1.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Bull Reversal Bar from 50-week MA and October Low.

It closed near the high and above last week’s close.&nbsp;<li>The bears failed to get follow-through selling following last week’s strong bear breakout.<li>Since this week is a strong bull reversal bar, it is a strong buy signal bar for next week. Should the Emini trade below this week’s low, odds are there will be buyers below.<li>The bears want a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce) from a lower high major trend reversal. It would then be a reversal lower from head &amp; shoulders (H&amp;S) top where the lower high is the right shoulder.<li>The bears want the pullback (bounce) to have overlapping bars with bear bars closing near the lows and weak bull bars. If they get that, the odds of a strong second leg lower increases.<li>However, a H&amp;S top often is a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>push down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>Last week, we said that the bulls want a strong bull reversal bar even though the Emini might trade slightly lower first possibly from a double bottom bull flag with October low which is also around the 50-week moving average. They got that this week.<li>The bulls see the selloff in the last 4 weeks as a bear trap and a sell vacuum test of the bottom of the 6-month trading range. Since this week closed near the high, next week may gap up at the open. Small gaps usually close early.&nbsp;<li>The bulls want a strong follow-through bar closing near the high. If they get that, odds are the week after should trade at least slightly higher still. If the bulls get consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in the next 1 to 3 weeks, we may get another strong leg up like the one from the October 2021 low. However, keep in mind that V bottoms are rare and less likely.<li>The minimum targets for the bulls are the December low or a 50% pullback of the selloff around 4510.<li>The selloff in the last 4 weeks was strong enough that traders expect at least a small second leg sideways to down after a pullback (bounce). If the bulls get consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in the next 1 to 3 weeks instead, it can lead to a retest of the trend extreme.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>The Surprise Bear Breakout last week may have increased the odds of a correction back to 50% or just slightly more, but the bears failed to get follow-through selling below the bottom of the 6-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that the best the bears probably can get this year is a 20% correction down to around the 4,000 Big Round Number. This remains true.<li>For now, next week should trade at least slightly higher. Whether the bulls get a strong follow-through bar next week or not will be a piece of key information.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-Daily-Bull-Reversal-Bar-Double-Bottom-Bull-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-30-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Daily Chart Bull Reversal Bar, Double Bottom Bull Flag?\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini gapped down far below the 200-day moving average on Monday and traded below October low but reversed back up to close as a strong bull reversal bar. The bulls however did not get follow-through buying on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Emini traded sideways in a tight trading range instead.&nbsp;<li>Friday triggered the low 1 sell signal bar but reversed higher to close near the week’s high as an outside bull bar around the 200-day moving average. It is a good high 2 bull signal bar for Monday. Since Friday closed near the week’s high, next week may gap up at the open. Small gaps usually close early.<li>The bulls see the recent selloff as a sell vacuum test of the trading range low which started in July 2021. As strong as the selling is, they want the selloff to simply be a bear leg in the developing 6-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>Bulls then want a double bottom bull flag with October low and a rally to re-test the trend extreme.<li>The selloff from the wedge top was stronger than all prior pullbacks since the pandemic crash. The move down from the high is in a tight bear channel which means strong selling.<li>Odds favor a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce), probably from a lower high around the December low and the 100-day moving average which also happens to be a 50% pullback of the selloff just above 4500.<li>The bears then want a reversal from a lower high which will be the right shoulder of a H&amp;S (head &amp; shoulders) top. They then want a strong break below the 6-month trading range and a measured move down to around 3600 based on the height of the 6-month trading range.<li>However, a H&amp;S top is often a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>leg down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>push down in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>Less likely, the pullback (bounce) will turn into a small pullback bull trend testing the trend extreme like the one in October. However, if the bulls get a series of consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in a tight bull channel, it can change the odds in the bull’s favor.<li>Al said that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. By trading below October low, traders concluded that the bull trend has evolved into a trading range.<li>A trading range in a strong bull trend eventually turns into a bull flag instead of leading into a bear trend. The odds favor a continuation of the trend making a new high probably in the second half of the year.&nbsp;<li>For now, there may be a bounce following recent oversold conditions. Odds favor a second leg sideways to down after the bounce is over.</ul><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-Weekly-Bear-Breakout-below-Tight-Trading-Range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-30-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Weekly Chart Bear Breakout below Tight Trading Range\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a Big Bear Surprise breakout bar closing near its low.

Two obvious magnets are the December lows and the 4600 round number. Bulls bought the December lows, confident those traders could scale in lower and look to take profits back at the December lows.<li>The bear selloff to the October lows is strong enough for a second leg down, so the odds are the first reversal up will be minor, leading to a bear flag or a trading range.<li>As strong as the selloff was in January, traders still see the market as either a bull trend or a trading range, not a bear trend. For traders to conclude a bear trend is underway, the price has to begin forming lower highs and lower lows. This means that the bears will look to sell some major trend reversal setup in the form of a lower high.<li>Since a trading range is likely, it is important to remember that the pullback might retrace 66% of the January rally. This would give the bears a great risk-reward.<li>The bulls are hopeful that this past Friday is the start of a bull breakout above a bear flag, or that the pullback from the January 25th selloff will lead to an endless pullback and form a small pullback bull trend.<li>Currently, the odds are that the market will test of to the December lows, and the bears will look to sell a rally for a second leg sideways to down.<li>The most important thing to remember is that the market is forming a tight trading range between the December and October 2021 lows, so traders should begin to expect more confusion and disappointment.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 3 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>The bulls want the market to gap up on the open, triggering the second entry buy on the daily chart.<li>If the market does not gap up on the open, the market will probably have to go above Friday’s high today at a minimum to see if there will be more buyers or sellers above.<li>Today will be important to see how to market will react to Friday’s high. If the bulls can get a strong rally and close above Friday’s high, that will increase the market’s odds to go higher.<li>Today will probably be disappointing for the bulls, which would further traders’ expectation of a trading range on the daily chart.<li>Today’s two very important price levels will be the open of the day and last Friday’s high (4426).</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-leg-1-equals-leg-2-measured-move-creating-buy-signal-bar-on-daily-chart.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-31.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and leg 1 equals leg 2 measured move creating buy signal bar on daily chart\"></a></figure><p><em>Al created the SP500 Emini charts.</em><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EURUSD-January-31-2022.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-1-31-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>The bears broke below the two-month tight trading range last week.

Two obvious magnets are the December lows and the 4600 round number.

For traders to conclude a bear trend is underway, the price has to begin forming lower highs and lower lows. This means that the bears will look to sell some major trend reversal setup in the form of a lower high.<li>Since a trading range is likely, it is important to remember that the pullback might retrace 66% of the January rally.
