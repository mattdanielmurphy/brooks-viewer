I have been saying since Friday that the Emini would probably rally this week. Yesterday was a strong bull trend day. It briefly traded above the 3100.00 Big Round Number at the end of the day and pulled back sharply.<p>Yesterday had a dramatic rally and selloff into the close of the month and of the 2nd quarter. Because the buying was so climactic, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading today that starts by the end of the 2nd hour. The late reversal down might be the start. The uncertainty regarding tomorrow’s unemployment report is another factor that increases the chance of trading range trading today.<h3>Monthly chart had bull doji in June</h3><p>On the monthly chart, June had a small bull body with big tails above and below. It was basically a doji bar, and it was at the top of a 2 1/2 year trading range. That does not give traders much information regarding what to expect in July.<p>Because the Emini is near the top of the range, the upside in July is not great. However, after 3 bull bars on the monthly chart, the bears do not expect a bear trend. Therefore, traders expect the trading range to continue in July. The bulls have a 50% chance of a new high this summer.<p>Also, if the Emini trades below the June low, traders expect the selloff to end after a month or two, near the middle of the trading range.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 12 points in the Globex session. Today and tomorrow are important days. If the bulls get one or two more bull trend days, the odds of a new all-time high will be more than 50%. If there is a big reversal down, traders will expect a correction down to the middle of the 2 1/2 year trading range.<p>Because yesterday had a huge climactic reversal, the 5 minute chart has a Big Up, Bid Down pattern. That creates Big Confusion. Since confusion is a hallmark of a trading range, traders expect at least a couple hours of trading range trading. It might begin on the open.<p>Huge moves like the 2 big bars at yesterday’s close often lead to a measured move. It can be up or down. If it is down, the Emini would test yesterday’s higher low.<p>If the move is going to be up, the Emini will probably 1st have to go sideways for a couple of hours before the exhausted bulls will buy aggressively again.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-strong-bull-trend-day-with-last-exhaustive-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-1.png\" alt=\"Emini strong bull trend day with last exhaustive buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is in Breakout Mode. The pattern is now a triangle. Like all Breakout Mode patterns, there is a 50% chance of either a successful bull or bear breakout. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout will fail.<p>When the EURUSD is at the apex of a triangle, the bars get small and the reversals come every day or two. It is a Limit Order market. That means there are usually more buyers below bars and sellers above bars. Traders bet on reversals instead of a breakout into a trend.<p>Eventually there is a breakout. It often follows news. Tomorrow’s US unemployment report is a possible catalyst.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market went sideways on the open, but sold off over the past few hours. It traded below yesterday’s low and bounced. Remember, Breakout Mode pattern is a Limit Order market. There are usually more buyers below the prior day’s low betting on a reversal up than sellers selling and betting on a trend down.<p>While a successful breakout can come at any time, most attempts will lead to reversals. Consequently, the overnight selloff will probably have bad follow-through.<p>Traders expect a trading range around yesterday’s low instead of a strong breakout below the bottom of the 4 week trading range. Therefore, day traders will be willing to both buy and sell. Additionally, since they know the odds are against a big move, they will scalp for 10 – 20 pips.<p>But, they know a strong breakout can come any day. If there is a series of big trend bars up or down, they will switch to swing trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-trending-trading-range-day-ahead-of-June-unemployment-report.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day ahead of June unemployment report\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was a bull trending trading range day. It closed in the middle of the day’s range.<p>Because there is a parabolic wedge rally on the 60 minute chart, the Emini might pull back tomorrow or Monday. However, the 3 day rally was strong enough to make at least slightly higher prices likely next week.<p>Tomorrow is the last trading day of the week because the markets are closed on Friday. Tomorrow’s unemployment report is less certain than normal. There is therefore an increased potential for a surprisingly big gap and then big trend day up or down. If there is a big rally, this week could become an outside up bar on the weekly chart.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Although it closed in the middle of the day’s range, it was still a third consecutive bull trend day. That increases the chance of higher prices.<p>This morning’s unemployment report is a potential catalyst for a big surprise up or down today. The initial move after the report was up, but there can always be a reversal of any strong move after a report.<p>Today is the final trading day of the week because of the holiday tomorrow. Today will probably go above last week’s high. This week would then be an outside up week on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>What happens if the week closes on its low? That is very unlikely with a strong 1st 3 days. But if it did, it would increase the chance that the Emini has begun a correction down to the middle of the 2 1/2 year trading range.<p>Traders need to be open to anything today. If there is a trend, up is more likely after this week’s rally.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex session just after the unemployment report. Traders see that the week has been bullish and that the initial move after the report was bullish. However, they know that there is still a 30% chance that the Emini will reverse down into a bear trend day after a big move up on a report.<p>This week reversed up from below last week’s low. It is now trading just above last week’s high. Consequently, this week will probably be an outside up week on the day session weekly chart. Since it is occurring in a bull trend on the weekly chart, it increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>There is no strong incentive for the bulls to rally far from here today. They are already making a strong statement by forming an outside up week. All they would like is for the week to close above last week’s high. The Emini could do that by simply being in a trading range today.<p>But because the week has been strongly up, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day today. Can today rally to above the June high? Since that is more than 70 points above the current price, it is probably too far above. However, the Emini will probably get there at some point in July.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-trending-trading-range-day-ahead-of-June-unemployment-report.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day ahead of June unemployment report\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The trading range has higher lows and lower highs and it is therefore a triangle.<p>Today is the 5th day without a bear body. Therefore, the EURUSD is slightly more bullish. But as long as it is still in the trading range, the probability cannot be more than 55% for either a bull or bear breakout.<p>Traders expect a measured move up or down once there is a successful breakout. Since the trading range is about 250 pips, a bull breakout could go above the March high. Traders would then conclude that the EURUSD’s 2 year bear trend was over.<p>If there is a downside measured move, the selloff could simply be a test of the April/May trading range. There is often a pullback to the breakout point after a strong breakout.<p>The bears need a break below the March low before traders will conclude that the 2 year bear trend is resuming. The EURUSD has been sideways for almost a year, even though the sideways move was also within the 2 year bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight from yesterday’s close. However, it has been sideways for 5 hours. Also, it is still below the June 23 lower high.<p>While the 2 day rally is bullish, it has not been especially strong. Traders see it as just another brief leg in the month-long trading range.<p>Day traders need to see several consecutive bull bars and big bull bars before concluding that today is going to rally much from where it has been for 5 hours.<p>Since reversals have been coming every couple of days, there is an increased chance of a reversal down today.<p>Because of the 5 hour trading range, day traders have been buying and selling for 10 pip scalps. Unless there is a strong breakout up or down, they will continue to scalp for the remainder of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It rallied for a few hours from a wedge bottom that formed just above yesterday’s high. There was then trend resumption down into the close.<p>Today had a bear body on the daily chart. It is a sell signal bar for Monday. Traders see today as a failed breakout above the June 24 lower high. However, it did not close on its low and this week was strong. Therefore if Monday trades below today’s low to trigger the sell signal, the selloff will probably only last for a day or two. Traders expect higher prices next week.<p>Today traded above last week’s high after the Emini traded below last week’s low earlier in the week. This week is an outside up week in a bull trend on the weekly chart. That increases the chance of higher prices next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Although it closed in the middle of the day’s range, it was still a third consecutive bull trend day. That increases the chance of higher prices.<p>This morning’s unemployment report is a potential catalyst for a big surprise up or down today. The initial move after the report was up, but there can always be a reversal of any strong move after a report.<p>Today is the final trading day of the week because of the holiday tomorrow. Today will probably go above last week’s high. This week would then be an outside up week on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>What happens if the week closes on its low? That is very unlikely with a strong 1st 3 days. But if it did, it would increase the chance that the Emini has begun a correction down to the middle of the 2 1/2 year trading range.<p>Traders need to be open to anything today. If there is a trend, up is more likely after this week’s rally.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex session just after the unemployment report. Traders see that the week has been bullish and that the initial move after the report was bullish. However, they know that there is still a 30% chance that the Emini will reverse down into a bear trend day after a big move up on a report.<p>This week reversed up from below last week’s low. It is now trading just above last week’s high. Consequently, this week will probably be an outside up week on the day session weekly chart. Since it is occurring in a bull trend on the weekly chart, it increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>There is no strong incentive for the bulls to rally far from here today. They are already making a strong statement by forming an outside up week. All they would like is for the week to close above last week’s high. The Emini could do that by simply being in a trading range today.<p>But because the week has been strongly up, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day today. Can today rally to above the June high? Since that is more than 70 points above the current price, it is probably too far above. However, the Emini will probably get there at some point in July.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-trending-trading-range-day-ahead-of-June-unemployment-report.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day ahead of June unemployment report\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The trading range has higher lows and lower highs and it is therefore a triangle.<p>Today is the 5th day without a bear body. Therefore, the EURUSD is slightly more bullish. But as long as it is still in the trading range, the probability cannot be more than 55% for either a bull or bear breakout.<p>Traders expect a measured move up or down once there is a successful breakout. Since the trading range is about 250 pips, a bull breakout could go above the March high. Traders would then conclude that the EURUSD’s 2 year bear trend was over.<p>If there is a downside measured move, the selloff could simply be a test of the April/May trading range. There is often a pullback to the breakout point after a strong breakout.<p>The bears need a break below the March low before traders will conclude that the 2 year bear trend is resuming. The EURUSD has been sideways for almost a year, even though the sideways move was also within the 2 year bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight from yesterday’s close. However, it has been sideways for 5 hours. Also, it is still below the June 23 lower high.<p>While the 2 day rally is bullish, it has not been especially strong. Traders see it as just another brief leg in the month-long trading range.<p>Day traders need to see several consecutive bull bars and big bull bars before concluding that today is going to rally much from where it has been for 5 hours.<p>Since reversals have been coming every couple of days, there is an increased chance of a reversal down today.<p>Because of the 5 hour trading range, day traders have been buying and selling for 10 pip scalps. Unless there is a strong breakout up or down, they will continue to scalp for the remainder of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It rallied for a few hours from a wedge bottom that formed just above yesterday’s high. There was then trend resumption down into the close.<p>Today had a bear body on the daily chart. It is a sell signal bar for Monday. Traders see today as a failed breakout above the June 24 lower high. However, it did not close on its low and this week was strong. Therefore if Monday trades below today’s low to trigger the sell signal, the selloff will probably only last for a day or two. Traders expect higher prices next week.<p>Today traded above last week’s high after the Emini traded below last week’s low earlier in the week. This week is an outside up week in a bull trend on the weekly chart. That increases the chance of higher prices next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But it is still in its month-long trading range. There is still a 50% chance of a selloff to below 2700 before the Emini makes a new high.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>have been sideways for 4 months. There is no sign that the tight trading range is about to end.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market rallied strongly in June to the bear trendline. It has stalled there and it has been in a tight trading range for a month. Because there is now an ii pattern, there will probably be a breakout up or down next week.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures weekly chart:</strong><br>Tight trading range after reversal down from extreme buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-4.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in tight trading range after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures weekly chart has been sideways for 4 months in a tight trading range. It is therefore in Breakout Mode. That means that there is an equal chance of a successful bull or bear breakout.<p>March reversed down strongly after the most dramatic 3 month buy climax in the history of the bond market. When that is the case, traders expect about a 10 bar sideways to down move. They look for the highest time frame that shows the pattern. Here, it is the monthly chart. Traders therefore expect the bond market to be sideways to down for about a year.<p>There is often one more buy climax before the pullback begins. That is what the bulls are hoping to see. But with each additional sideways month, the odds of that decrease.<p>Even if they were to get a breakout above the March buy climax high, it would probably fail. There would then be a 2nd reversal down. That would have a higher probability of leading to a swing down.<h3>Target is the bottom of the last leg up</h3><p>Whether or not there is a new high. traders expect the reversal down to test the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the January low. The bottom of the bull leg is the November 2019 low.<p>Since a correction from a buy climax typically lasts about 10 bars and has at least 2 legs, it could take a year or more to get there. Furthermore, there might be a bull breakout above the 4 month tight trading range before the correction begins.<p>As I said, the bulls might even get a brief break above the March high before the reversal begins. But if there is a break above the 4 month range, it will more likely fail and reverse down from a lower high than from a new all-time high.<p>What about the mantra, “Gold to infinity, interest rates to zero!”? It sounds good on TV, but that does not make it true. Nothing is going to infinity and the bond charts look like the high is already in.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex weekly chart:</strong><br>5 week tight trading range after strong rally to top of bear channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range-at-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-4-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart in tight trading range at bear trend line\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart has been in a tight trading range for 5 weeks. This week’s low was above last week’s low. Also, its high was below last week’s high. This week was therefore an inside bar.<p>Last week was an inside bar as well. There are therefore consecutive inside bars on the weekly chart. That is an ii (inside-inside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode setup.<p>Every 5 week tight trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. However, the ii increases the chance that there will be a breakout next week.<p>With all Breakout Mode patterns, there is an equal chance for the bulls and bear. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail.<p>Given the context, do the bulls or bears have an advantage? Sometimes one side has a slight edge, but not here. The strong rally favors the bulls. But the rally has stalled at the top of a 2 year bear channel. That is good for the bears.<p>Does the breakout have to come next week. Not necessarily. Rarely, there is a 3rd consecutive inside bar, which then is an iii Breakout Mode pattern.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Shrinking bodies at top of 2 1/2 year trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-SP500-monthly-futures-candlestick-chart-testing-top-of-trading-range-but-losing-momentum.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly futures candlestick chart testing top of trading range but losing momentum\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has rallied strongly for 3 months. It is now just below the all-time high.<p>However, it is also near the top of a 2 1/2 year trading range. Moreover, the bodies have been shrinking. That is a sign that the rally is losing momentum. The big tails in June make it almost a neutral month.<p>The bulls can argue that the 3 month rally is strong and therefore the Emini should go higher. But the bears see the rally losing momentum at the resistance at the top of the range.<p>There is still room to the resistance of the February high and the momentum continues to be up. Consequently, the bulls continue to have a 50% chance of a test of the old high within the next month or two.<p>If July trades below the June low, the bears will see a lower high double top with the February high. However, June had a bull body. That is a weak sell signal bar. In addition, there are 3 consecutive bull bars. That is bad context for a reversal.<p>Therefore, if July trades below the June low, the sell signal will be weak. The best the bears can probably get is a 1 – 2 month pullback to the middle of the 2 1/2 year trading range.<h3>Strength usually leads to more strength</h3><p>CNBC has an interesting<a aria-label=\"article that compares the current market to prior markets (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/03/handicapping-the-market-from-here-what-history-tells-us-about-the-odds-the-comeback-continues.html\" target=\"_blank\">article that compares the current market to prior markets</a>.<p>The 3 month rally was exceptionally strong, up 20%.There have been 9 other times since World War II when the market rallied 15% or more in a quarter. In every instance, the market was higher at the end of the next quarter. The average gain was 9%.<p>Also, Ned Davis Research says on May 26, 90% of stocks in the S&amp;P500 were above their 50 day moving averages. That has happened 19 times since 1967 and the market was up 1 year later in every instance. The average gain was 17%.<p>While traders don’t like to fight the tape, there are always countless variables that can affect these results. It is impossible to know if the current variables are significant enough to make traders question these statistics.<p>For example, how many of the quarterly rallies came from a crash, and how many ended just below the top of a trading range? If you were to only look at prior times that included these 2 additional variables, the sample size would shrink considerably. It might even become so small to eliminate the expected benefit.<p>There is one other historical trend that is important. When an incumbent president loses re-election, the stock market on average sells off a little in September and October. Since most pundits believe Trump will lose, that increases the chance of a pullback before November 3.<p>Things like this are entertaining, but not tradable. Traders trade what is in front of them, even though they might give some consideration to historical tendencies. If the market is selling off, but a study says it should be going up, smart traders will sell and ignore the research.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Outside up week but in 5 week tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-SP500-weekly-futures-candlestick-chart-outside-up-in-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-4-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly futures candlestick chart outside up in bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed an outside up bar this week. The week traded below last week’s low and then above its high. This is a sign of strong bulls, especially when it is in a strong bull trend.<p>However, the week did not close above last week’s high. Therefore, the bulls were not as strong as they could have been. Traders would have seen the week as much more bullish if the week closed on its high and far above last week’s high.<p>Last week was a bear bar and a sell signal bar for a Low 2 top. When this week traded below last week’s low, this week triggered the sell signal.<p>But there were more traders looking to buy the sell signal than willing to sell it. The Emini immediately reversed up and rallied strongly all week.<h3>Tight trading range so expect reversals</h3><p>It is especially relevant that the weekly chart has been sideways for 5 weeks. When you look at the 5 candlesticks, you should notice something. Each week was a strong candlestick that was in the opposite direction of the prior week (bull, bear, bull, bear, bull). Therefore a big trend bar is not as meaningful as a similar bar that is not within a tight trading range.<p>Don’t get too excited with there is a big trend bar in a tight trading range. It has less predictive power than what you might think. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout.<h3>The importance of the big gap down in February</h3><p>A failed sell signal in a strong bull trend typically means that the market has to go higher to find more sellers. I have talked about the gap about the February 24 high many times. Gaps on the weekly chart are rare. That gap was huge and it was the start of the pandemic crash. It therefore is important and a strong magnet.<p>I have been saying the the biggest problem with any reversal down over the past month is that many traders are unwilling to sell until after they see a test into that gap. Alternatively, they will sell if there is a strong reversal down. If the Emini trades into the gap, traders will then wonder if the rally will make a new all-time high.<p>There is currently a 50% chance that the rally will enter the gap before reversing down to the middle of the 2 1/2 year trading range. If it does, there will be a 50% chance of a new all-time high before a reversal down.<h3>What about the bears?</h3><p>There is always a bear case. The Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years. That means that reversals are more likely than a successful breakout. Remember, the February high led to a reversal down from above the range. Also, the March low reversed up from the below the bottom of the range. When any market is within a trading, nothing is as bullish or bearish as it might appear.<p>The bears had a good chance of beginning a reversal down this week, but they failed. They will try again over the next few weeks. For example, if the Emini enters the gap, the bears will try to have the breakout above the February 24 high fail. If they can create a big bear bar closing near its low, traders will look to sell a reversal down from the gap.<p>They can even create a sell signal next week. If next week goes above this week’s high, but reverses down and closes on its low, traders will again look to sell.<p>Alternatively, what happens if next week fails to break above this week’s high? Suppose that this week is a bear inside bar closing on its low. There would then be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. If the bar closed near its low, it would be a credible sell signal bar. Traders would be prepared for a reversal down.<h3>The Fed is promising protection</h3><p>I have said many times that the Fed strongly made the point that they will “print infinite money” to protect the economy. Nothing else matters. Bad earnings, high unemployment, reduced consumer spending, the possibility of Biden winning, the possibility of Trump winning, the chance that the democrats will win the Senate… who cares? Investors believe that the Fed will buy anything, including ETFs, to prevent a dangerous selloff. Therefore, the Fed is essentially providing a put for anyone who owns stock. They are promising that the downside is not dangerous.<p>It is important to note that they allowed a 35% selloff in March. I suspect that they will allow a 50% pullback at some point within the next couple years. But traders believe that the Fed will buy aggressively at some unknown level. Therefore, if a trader buys at the high and the market falls 50%, they can buy more, expecting a big enough Fed bounce to allow them to exit their position at their average entry price and avoid a loss.<p>Investors think they are trading risk free so why not buy, even at the high? Either the Emini continues up and you make a profit. Or, it goes down, you buy more, and then make a profit.<p>But complacency can be expensive. Many traders think they will buy more if the Emini drops 20%. But when it actually does, they might get scared and instead exit with a huge loss.<h3>How low can the Emini go?</h3><p>Given that the Fed has guaranteed that it will protect the economy, traders are confident that the protection will include the stock market.<p>However, the Fed will not bother to stop a 2% selloff. What about a 15% selloff? No one knows when they will come in. There are many factors involved, including the rate of the selloff and the reason behind it.<p>Also, there is the extra protection that comes ahead of the election. The Fed does not want to do anything that will make traders believe they are trying to influence the election in either direction. That means their best course is to keep their promise that they will protect the economy.<p>This significantly reduces the chance of another crash ahead of the election. This is true even though there are sometimes big selloffs in the August through October window.<p>However, the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2. Experienced traders expect occasional pullbacks to the middle of the range. That middle is around 2700, which would be about a 15% correction. It could be a little more or less, but the 2600 – 2700 area is probably the lowest the Emini can go until after the election.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Double top bear flag but still in month-long tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-SP500-daily-futures-candlestick-chart-double-top-bear-flag-but-strong-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-4-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily futures candlestick chart double top bear flag but strong rally\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been sideways for a month. However, this week’s reversal up was strong. It came from a higher low, and there was both a strong buy signal bar and a strong entry bar. The reversal up was enough to make traders believe that the Emini will break above the trading range next week.<p>The next target is the June high and then the gap above the February 24 high (seen on the weekly chart). If the bulls can get a strong rally up to the gap, the rally will probably continue to a new high.<p>As long as the Emini is in its month-long range, the probability of either a bull or bear breakout cannot be more than 55%. And that probability changes with each day’s price action. It is currently slightly more bullish, but a couple down days will shift the odds in favor of the bears again. Traders believe that there is about a 50% chance of a selloff to 2700 before there is a new high.<h3>Can the Emini reverse down from here?</h3><p>It is important to note that while Thursday broke above the June 23 top of the range, it did not break far above. Also, it did not close above the trading range. Consequently, the bears still have almost a 50% chance of getting a reversal down from a double top with the June 23 high.<p>This is a double top lower high major trend reversal (the 2nd high in the double top is slightly higher). A major trend reversal has a 40% chance of leading to an actual reversal of the trend and not just a small leg down (a minor reversal).<p>Thursday is a sell signal bar. But, there was a prominent tail below the bar. Also, the bear body was small and it followed a strong 3 day rally. Consequently, if Monday falls below Thursday’s low to trigger the double top sell signal, the selloff will probably only last a day or two.<p>The bulls would likely try at least once more to break above the top of the month-long range. Therefore, a selloff on Monday will more likely be a pullback from this week’s rally than a trend reversal down from the double top.<p>But, if the reversal down comes from a big bear bar or 2 or 3 smaller bear bars, the probability will again favor the bears. Because the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2, traders expect a pullback to the middle of the range at some point.<p>It can begin at any time. And that includes from above the all-time high. There are often brief breakouts of a range before there is a reversal.<p>It is important to remember that surprisingly strong selloffs tend to occur in August through October. I have talked many times about the<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-lower-high-major-trend-reversal-gap-magnet-above/#downside-targets-include-bo-points-and-prior-hl\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"magnets below between 2600 - 2700. (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">magnets below between 2600 – 2700.</a>If the Emini breaks strongly below the June low, it will probably reach those targets before testing the all-time high.<h3>The market does not believe that Biden is going to be an economic disaster</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/President-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-4-5.png\" alt=\"stock market under democrat presidents\"></a></figure><p>Most people at this point<a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oddsmakers-say-joe-biden-is-the-favorite-over-donald-trump-in-the-2020-election-2020-06-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">believe Biden is going to win</a>in November. That is already factored into the current price. Therefore, smart money does not see him as a disaster. If it did, the market would already be way down.<p>It is a mistake to believe that the stock market does worse when democrats are president. In fact, the data shows the opposite. The average gain under democrat presidents is greater than under republican presidents. This chart shows the S&amp;P500 cash index under the 5 most recent presidents.<p>The lesson is that the market and the economy is too big and powerful for a president to have much influence. Yes, taxes are higher when a democrat is president, but there are countless other ways that a president can influence the market, and there are many other variables as well.<p>When you factor everything in, there is probably no significant difference. This is true even though the data shows that the market does better under democrats. I think the sample size is too small to draw a conclusion other than it does not clearly matter.<p>Incidentally, this presupposes that Trump will be the candidate. I have been telling my friends for several weeks that I am not convinced he will continue to run. He hates to lose, and he might conclude at some point that the loss could be big enough to damage his brand. Dropping out has to be a consideration.<h3>Traders might be waiting for a vaccine</h3><p>Many traders are hesitant to buy up here until there is a vaccine. They know that it is possible that there will not be a vaccine, or at least not until late in 2021.<p>Everyone expects one early in 2021 and they will be disappointed if it is not ready. Their fear is that it will never be ready. The market is at a price consistent with a vaccine coming out in about 6 months. If there is not going to be a vaccine, that would be horrible for the economy and therefore the stock market would reprice to a much lower level.<p>Traders knows that an approved vaccine is worthy of a special rally. That special rally might be a new all-time high. I believe there is an unspoken belief that the Emini will not make a new high until after there is a vaccine.<p>If enough traders come to believe that, the market will sense a lack of buying at the current price. It would then have to fall to find buyers. For example, it could reach my target zone below 2700 within a few months. Then, at the end of the year, if a vaccine got approved, the Emini could rally to a new high.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But since it has a small body, it was a doji bar. That represents a loss of momentum. It lowers the probability of a strong rally in July.<p>On the weekly chart, last week was an outside up bar in a bull trend. It is therefore a buy signal bar for this week. Traders expect higher prices at some point this week.<p>On the daily chart, last week’s rally was strong. Traders expect at least a test of Thursday’s high today and probably a test of the February 24 gap soon.<p>The bears want a reversal down today from around Thursday’s high. There would then be a micro double top and a double top with the June 19 high. Traders would then look for a test of the June 15 low. But, the bull case is stronger.<h3>Possible 4 month island bottom on the weekly chart</h3><p>If today gaps above last week’s high, there will be a gap up on the weekly chart. Remember, there was a gap down on the weekly chart on February 24. A gap up today will create a 4 month island bottom since that February gap down.<p>The bulls will want a measured move up based on the 1,000 point height of the island bottom. That is unlikely, and it would probably take a couple years.<p>Most island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns. Therefore, it is more likely that the gap up will close at some point this year because that is what usually happens to gaps in trading ranges.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 39 points in the Globex session. Today therefore might gap above last week’s high. This would be a gap up on the weekly chart and create a 4 month island bottom.<p>The bears want the gap up to fail in the 1st hour. They would like a strong selloff from the open and then a bear trend day. Today would then be a failed breakout above the June 19/July 2 double top. Traders would then expect a test of the June low. They have a 40% chance of success.<p>The daily, weekly, and monthly charts are bullish. It is therefore more likely that today will either be a bull trend day or at least a trading range day. Because of the possible island bottom on the weekly chart and the break above the 3 week tight trading range, there is an increased chance of a big bull trend day day.<h2>Thursday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from last Thursday.

Today so far is a big bull bar closing near its high. It is breaking far above last week’s high and the bear trend line at the top of the triangle. If today closes near the high if the day, traders will expect a test of the June high.<p>I mentioned over the weekend that there was an ii on the weekly chart. I also said that there would probably be a breakout above or below this week. Today is a breakout above.<p>Also, every market is always in some kind of a channel. Since the EURUSD is in a bull trend, it is in a bull channel. If the EURUSD continues up this week, traders will expect the rally to reach the top of the wedge bull channel based on the March 27 and June 10 highs. That would require a break above the June high and it would be the highest price in over a year.<p>It is important to remember that the EURUSD is still in the June trading range. As long as it is in a trading range, the probabilities are never as high as they might appear. While today so far is good for the bulls, if it ends with a big tail on top, like June 23, traders will begin to think that today might just be a test of the June 16/June 23 double top and not of the June 10 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied in a tight bull channel overnight to far above Friday’s high. Day traders are only buying and they have been swing trading and scalping.<p>At some point, they will start to take profits. This will convert the bull trend into at least a small trading range. If the height of the range grows to about 30 pips, some day traders will begin to sell for scalps. Also, they will switch from buying at the market to buying 10 – 20 pip pullbacks.<p>However, unless there is a reversal down of 50 or more pips, which is unlikely, it will continue to be easier to make money as a bull.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-triangle-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls got a breakout at the end of the day.<p>The bears want a 2nd failed breakout above the 3 week range. They will try to create a bear sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>However, at the moment, traders believe that the Emini will test into the gap above the February 24 high before reversing down. They will probably buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback, unless there is a surprisingly big reversal day down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It broke above last week’s high yesterday, but the breakout was small. The Emini is near the top of the 5 week range, which is also the June high.<p>With June being a doji bar on the monthly chart, July might fail to break above the June high. However, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top on the daily chart before they can get a reversal down. That means that the bulls plan to buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback.<p>The end of the quarter rally continued yesterday, but it typically ends around July 5. Consequently, traders should get a brief pullback this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 24 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap below yesterday’s close and possibly below yesterday’s low.<p>After a 5 day rally, traders expect a 1 – 2 day pullback. But they also think a reversal down from here will only last a day or two. That reduces the chance that a gap down today will be the start of a big bear trend day.<p>Can today trade below yesterday’s low and then above yesterday’s high? Yes, especially since yesterday’s range was small. But after a 5 day rally in a tight bull channel on the 60 minute chart, traders expect that a move below yesterday’s low will probably instead begin a 1 – 2 day pullback. Day traders are looking for a sideways to down day today.<p>A big gap down usually results in a trading range open for the 1st hour or two. The bulls will look for a double bottom or wedge bottom to buy for a swing up. The bears will look for a double top or wedge rally to sell for a swing down.<p>The day might spend a lot of time oscillating in a range between the 60 minute 20 bar EMA, which is just below 3140, and last week’s high, which is just below 3160 and around yesterday’s low.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-triangle-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-7.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It broke above last week’s high yesterday, but the breakout was small. The Emini is near the top of the 5 week range, which is also the June high.<p>With June being a doji bar on the monthly chart, July might fail to break above the June high. However, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top on the daily chart before they can get a reversal down. That means that the bulls plan to buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback.<p>The end of the quarter rally continued yesterday, but it typically ends around July 5. Consequently, traders should get a brief pullback this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 24 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap below yesterday’s close and possibly below yesterday’s low.<p>After a 5 day rally, traders expect a 1 – 2 day pullback. But they also think a reversal down from here will only last a day or two. That reduces the chance that a gap down today will be the start of a big bear trend day.<p>Can today trade below yesterday’s low and then above yesterday’s high? Yes, especially since yesterday’s range was small. But after a 5 day rally in a tight bull channel on the 60 minute chart, traders expect that a move below yesterday’s low will probably instead begin a 1 – 2 day pullback. Day traders are looking for a sideways to down day today.<p>A big gap down usually results in a trading range open for the 1st hour or two. The bulls will look for a double bottom or wedge bottom to buy for a swing up. The bears will look for a double top or wedge rally to sell for a swing down.<p>The day might spend a lot of time oscillating in a range between the 60 minute 20 bar EMA, which is just below 3140, and last week’s high, which is just below 3160 and around yesterday’s low.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-triangle-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-7.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is now a micro double top on the daily chart for a failed breakout above the 3 week trading range. Yesterday is the sell signal bar.<p>But yesterday was the 1st pullback in a 5 day rally.

That means that they will take profits and wait for at least a couple hours before considering to sell aggressively again.<p>There is often some follow-through selling in the 1st hour after a sell climax day.

Today is therefore the 2nd consecutive inside bar. That is a Breakout Mode pattern. The month-long trading range is also a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Because the past 9 closes are above the EMA and Monday broke above a small bear trend line, the pattern is currently slightly more bullish than bearish. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. The odds cannot be more than 55% for the bulls or bears until there is a clear breakout.While waiting for the breakout up or down, traders are looking for reversals every 2 – 3 days.<p>Even though the bulls are slightly stronger at the moment, one big bear day would shift the odds back in favor of the bears. They see Monday as forming a double top with June 29, and that double top is a lower high major trend reversal down from June 10.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 30 pip range overnight and it has had many reversals. Day traders have been scalping. If today remains the 2nd inside day on the daily chart, there will probably be at least a small breakout tomorrow.<p>A breakout can come at any time, but there is no sign yet that it will come today.

Today rallied, sold off, and rallied again from a higher low major trend reversal. It was a trading range day, but it closed near its high and that makes higher prices likely.<p>Today is a buy signal bar for tomorrow. The bulls see today as the end of a 2 day pullback from a 5 day rally. Today closed back at the open of the week. Since last week’s rally was strong, traders expect higher prices.<h3>Stuck at last week’s high</h3><p>It is important to note that this week has been oscillating around last week’s high. Last week was a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. This week triggered the buy signal. However, this week so far has failed to move strongly above last week’s high.<p>There are 2 trading days left in the week. The bulls want a big bull trend day on the weekly chart. That will make higher prices likely next week.<p>The bears are hoping that this week’s buy signal will fail. They want the week to close on its low to become a sell signal bar for next week.

The odds cannot be more than 55% for the bulls or bears until there is a clear breakout.While waiting for the breakout up or down, traders are looking for reversals every 2 – 3 days.<p>Even though the bulls are slightly stronger at the moment, one big bear day would shift the odds back in favor of the bears. They see Monday as forming a double top with June 29, and that double top is a lower high major trend reversal down from June 10.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 30 pip range overnight and it has had many reversals. Day traders have been scalping. If today remains the 2nd inside day on the daily chart, there will probably be at least a small breakout tomorrow.<p>A breakout can come at any time, but there is no sign yet that it will come today. Day traders will continue to scalp up and down while they wait.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-late-bull-breakout-above-triangle-after-parabolic-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-8-2.png\" alt=\"Emini late bull breakout above triangle after parabolic wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today rallied, sold off, and rallied again from a higher low major trend reversal. It was a trading range day, but it closed near its high and that makes higher prices likely.<p>Today is a buy signal bar for tomorrow. The bulls see today as the end of a 2 day pullback from a 5 day rally. Today closed back at the open of the week. Since last week’s rally was strong, traders expect higher prices.<h3>Stuck at last week’s high</h3><p>It is important to note that this week has been oscillating around last week’s high. Last week was a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. This week triggered the buy signal. However, this week so far has failed to move strongly above last week’s high.<p>There are 2 trading days left in the week. The bulls want a big bull trend day on the weekly chart. That will make higher prices likely next week.<p>The bears are hoping that this week’s buy signal will fail. They want the week to close on its low to become a sell signal bar for next week. But at the moment, the bull case is stronger.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was therefore a trading range day.<p>But after a midday higher low major trend reversal, it closed near its high. I have been saying for several days that the best the bears would probably get this week was a 1 – 2 day pullback. Yesterday is a good candidate for the end of that pullback. It closed back at the open of the week.<p>Even though the Emini is still in its 6 week trading range, this week triggered a buy signal on the weekly chart. Yesterday is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. Traders expect higher prices.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. It is near the high of last week and the open of this week.<p>Both prices will be important when the candlestick on the weekly chart closes tomorrow. The bulls want at least a small bull body on the weekly candlestick. That means they want tomorrow to close above this week’s open. That would also be a close above last week’s high. Traders would then expect higher prices next week.<p>However, if the week closes below the open and below last week’s high, there would be a micro double top with Monday’s high. Traders would then look for a reversal down next week.<p>The daily and weekly charts are both in bull trends. Consequently, traders expect higher prices. But the Emini might stay around the open of the week today and then decide at the end of tomorrow if the week will have a bull or bear body on the weekly chart.<p>Because yesterday is a buy signal bar in a bull trend, there is an increased chance of a bull trend. However, the Emini is also near the top of a month-long trading range. Therefore, the bulls have only a slight advantage.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-late-bull-breakout-above-triangle-after-parabolic-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-9.png\" alt=\"Emini late bull breakout above triangle after parabolic wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

So far, today is a doji bar on the daily chart, and its close is below the June 16/June 23 double top.<p>This is a weak breakout. The bulls want today to close above the double top and on the high of the bar. Furthermore, they want today to have a big range.<p>It does not look like they will achieve their goals. At a minimum, they want today to close above the open so that it will have at least a small bull body.<p>Because the EURUSD is now near the top of the trading range, the bulls are starting to take profits and the bears are beginning to sell. If enough traders sell up here, there will be a reversal down instead of a breakout above the June high.<p>When a market is in a trading range, reversals are move common than breakouts. The bears are hoping that today will be the start of a bear leg. They see the 2 week rally as forming a wedge, which often is a reversal pattern.<p>They want today to close near its low. It would then be a reasonable sell signal bar for tomorrow. The bears would have a wedge rally and another attempt at a lower high major trend reversal down from the 2 year bear trend line (not shown).<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to above the June 16/June 23 double top today, but reversed down to a new low of the day. It has since bounced to back above the open of the day.<p>There have been 2 legs up and one leg down. So far, today is a trading range day and it is trading around the open of the day and the June double top. Traders are deciding if the breakout on the daily chart will fail or succeed.<p>With the EURUSD oscillating around the magnets of the open and the double top, there is confusion. Confusion typically results in a trading range. Consequently, day traders are expecting a trading range and reversals for the rest of the day. They therefore are scalping.<p>Because the EURUSD is at an important price, there is an increased chance of a surprise up or down. But with the lack of consecutive big trend bars in either direction, it is more likely that today will remain a trading range day. It will probably close near the open and not provide much information about what to expect tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Tomorrow is Friday so those weekly magnets can be important, especially at the end of the day.<p>The daily chart has been in a tight trading range at the top of a 6 week trading range. Traders are deciding whether the rally will continue up to the old high or reverse down to the middle of the 3 year range. Because the daily and weekly charts are in bull trends, the probability slightly favors a bull breakout of the 6 week range.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This is the 1st time that the bulls have had consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart in 5 weeks. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices this week.<p>The bears want a double top with the June 5 high. If they get a reversal down this week, there would be a wedge rally with the June 19 and July 6 highs.<p>Many double tops have a wedge rally for the 2nd leg up. But the bears will need a reversal down for a sell signal. The odds favor the bulls. June was a bull flag and the Emini is now breaking above that flag.<h3>The importance of the gap above the February 24 high</h3><p>For the past several months, I have been talking about the gap above the February 24 high on the weekly chart. For the past month, the Emini tried to reverse down from below the gap several times and failed.<p>Big weekly gaps are rare. That makes the gap an unusually important magnet. Once a market gets close to a strong magnet, it usually has to reach the target before traders will consider selling aggressively.<p>Consequently, traders should expect a move to above the 3238.25 February 24 high within a week or two. At that point, traders will then decide if the Emini will reverse down or continue up to a new high.<h3>Possible island bottom on weekly chart</h3><p>Last week gapped up, but the gap was small and it quickly closed. Because this week closed on its high, there is an increased chance of a gap up this week as well. This is especially true with the strong magnet of the February 24 high just slightly above.<p>If there is a gap up, there will be a 4 month island bottom on the weekly chart. While island tops and bottoms are minor patterns, they are still signs of strength. The bulls will try to keep the gap open so that more traders will buy, expecting a new all-time high.<p>What happens if today does not gap up? Traders still expect a test into that February gap. Therefore, the odds favor higher prices over the next couple weeks, whether or not today sells off.<p>When a market gets nears an important magnet, it often accelerates toward the magnet. Why would a bear sell now when he believes he will be able to sell higher at the magnet soon? That shortage of sellers can create a buy vacuum up to resistance.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. This week will probably open above last week’s high. There will then be a 4 month island bottom on the weekly chart.<p>Since this is the 2nd consecutive attempt to create an island bottom on the weekly chart, there is a higher probability of success. With the gap only being about half of the average recent daily range and with it likely to remain open today, traders should expect either a bull trend or trading range day today.<p>Is Friday’s buy climax a problem for the bulls today? Usually, the day after a buy climax day enters a trading range for at least a couple hours, starting by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>While that could happen today, there might be enough euphoria about the break above the July high to create another bull trend day today. Day traders should look for a bullish bias today, and possibly a reasonably strong bull trend day.<p>However, if the gap closes again like it did last Monday, day traders will expect a bear trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-13.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

The bulls see Friday as just another small pullback, this time from a break above the June 16/June 23 double top. It is a High 1 buy signal bar, and the buy signal triggered today when today went above Friday’s high<p>However, the bears see Friday as a fail breakout above a 3 week range. It is their sell signal bar for a lower high major trend reversal.<p>Both the buy setup and the sell setup are credible. That means that the chart is in a trading range, which it obviously is, and that it is still in Breakout Mode. The probability alternates a little in favor of the bulls and the bears, but is stays very close to 50% for both. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will continue to look for minor reversals every 2 – 3 days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke a little above Friday’s high, but has stalled. If today closes far above Friday’s high and on the high of the day, traders will expect a breakout above last week’s high. They then would expect a test of the June 10 high and the March 9 high within a couple weeks. The bigger today’s bull body and the more the day closes on its high, the more likely the bull trend will test the March high.<p>The bears always want the opposite. At a minimum, they want today to close below Friday’s high. They would prefer for today to close on the low. It would then be a reasonable sell signal bar for a 2nd reversal down from the June 16/June 23 double top.<h3>Overnight expanding triangle</h3><p>Because the overnight range has been small, day traders have been scalping. Today broke above Friday’s low overnight, but then sold off to below the session low. It is now back above Friday’s high.<p>This is bullish and day traders are more willing to buy pullback than to sell rallies. But unless today breaks far above Friday’s high, day traders will still be willing to sell reversals down for a scalp.<p>Since today reversed up from a new low, it will probably not trade back down to the low. That reduces the chance of a big bear day.<p>However, because of the reversals overnight, there is now an expanding triangle on the 5 minute chart. That is a potentially credible sell setup, but the bears need a strong reversal down. So far they are not getting it. Today will probably remain a small, scalping day. If there is a trend, up is more likely than down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-at-2019-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal at 2019 close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It rallied above the June high and above the close of 2019.<p>However, it reversed down from a Final Bull Flag and made a new low. This is the 2nd consecutive Monday when the bulls created an island bottom on the weekly chart, but could not keep the gap open. Furthermore, the month-long rally is a wedge and a double top with the June high.<p>Today is a credible sell setup for a swing down to the middle of the 4 month trading range. Most reversal attempts are minor. Therefore the probability is not particularly high. However, this is a good sell setup for the bears hoping for a move down to below 2700 over the next month.<p>The odds are now against a move up to the February gap before a reversal down.

This is the 1st time that the bulls have had consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart in 5 weeks. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices this week.<p>The bears want a double top with the June 5 high. If they get a reversal down this week, there would be a wedge rally with the June 19 and July 6 highs.<p>Many double tops have a wedge rally for the 2nd leg up. But the bears will need a reversal down for a sell signal. The odds favor the bulls. June was a bull flag and the Emini is now breaking above that flag.<h3>The importance of the gap above the February 24 high</h3><p>For the past several months, I have been talking about the gap above the February 24 high on the weekly chart. For the past month, the Emini tried to reverse down from below the gap several times and failed.<p>Big weekly gaps are rare. That makes the gap an unusually important magnet. Once a market gets close to a strong magnet, it usually has to reach the target before traders will consider selling aggressively.<p>Consequently, traders should expect a move to above the 3238.25 February 24 high within a week or two. At that point, traders will then decide if the Emini will reverse down or continue up to a new high.<h3>Possible island bottom on weekly chart</h3><p>Last week gapped up, but the gap was small and it quickly closed. Because this week closed on its high, there is an increased chance of a gap up this week as well. This is especially true with the strong magnet of the February 24 high just slightly above.<p>If there is a gap up, there will be a 4 month island bottom on the weekly chart. While island tops and bottoms are minor patterns, they are still signs of strength. The bulls will try to keep the gap open so that more traders will buy, expecting a new all-time high.<p>What happens if today does not gap up? Traders still expect a test into that February gap. Therefore, the odds favor higher prices over the next couple weeks, whether or not today sells off.<p>When a market gets nears an important magnet, it often accelerates toward the magnet. Why would a bear sell now when he believes he will be able to sell higher at the magnet soon? That shortage of sellers can create a buy vacuum up to resistance.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. This week will probably open above last week’s high. There will then be a 4 month island bottom on the weekly chart.<p>Since this is the 2nd consecutive attempt to create an island bottom on the weekly chart, there is a higher probability of success. With the gap only being about half of the average recent daily range and with it likely to remain open today, traders should expect either a bull trend or trading range day today.<p>Is Friday’s buy climax a problem for the bulls today? Usually, the day after a buy climax day enters a trading range for at least a couple hours, starting by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>While that could happen today, there might be enough euphoria about the break above the July high to create another bull trend day today. Day traders should look for a bullish bias today, and possibly a reasonably strong bull trend day.<p>However, if the gap closes again like it did last Monday, day traders will expect a bear trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-13.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

There are now consecutive failed island bottom attempts.<p>In addition, the month-long wedge rally is reversing down from a double top with the June high, which is a common reversal combination. Also, the Emini reversed down from above the 2019 close. Finally, yesterday closed near its low and it therefore a good sell signal bar for today.<p>If the bears can get follow-through selling over the next few days, this week will probably be the start of a pullback to the middle of the 3 year trading range.<p>One problem that the bears have is that yesterday was a big bar on the daily chart and it closed near the bottom of a 7 day tight trading range. A big bar means big risk.<p>Also, selling at the bottom of a tight trading range is a low probability bet. Therefore, yesterday is not as bearish as it might seem. The bears need strong follow-through today. Otherwise, traders will believe that yesterday is just a brief pullback in a bull trend.<p>The bulls need a quick reversal back up today or tomorrow. If today is another big bear day, the odds will be in favor a test of the bottom of the month-long trading range.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 8 points in the Globex session. There might be a small gap down. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>The Emini had a sell climax yesterday. There is only a 25% chance of a big bear day that begins on the open today.<p>Traders know that there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour today. The bulls want a close above the open so that today would have a bull body on the daily chart. That would reduce the chance of a successful reversal down on the daily chart. If today closes near its high, traders will suspect that yesterday was a bear trap and that the rally up to the February gap is intact.<p>But if today closes near its low, and especially if it is a big bear day, traders will expect a test down to the bottom of the month-long trading range.<p>Traders do not yet know if yesterday’s bears are exhausted. But they believe that the bears will begin to take some profits before the end of the 2nd hour.<p>Once the bears take profits, the bear trend typically ends for at least a couple hours. That usually leads to a period of confusion, which means a trading range. Traders will then look for either a reversal up or a resumption down.<p>The most important price today will be the open. The bears want a bear body on the daily chart and the bulls want a bull body.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-at-2019-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal at 2019 close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, it is still in a month-long trading range. Therefore, the probability of a successful breakout above the March 9 high is only slightly better than 50%. But if the bulls get consecutive closes above that high, traders will conclude that the yearlong trading range has ended and a bull trend has begun.<p>The bears want to get a reversal down. They prefer to get it from below the June 10 or March 9 highs. Most importantly, they need to reverse the trend before there are consecutive closes above the March 9 high. They do not want traders to believe that the EURUSD has evolved into a strong bull trend.<p>The bears need a couple big bear days for traders to conclude that the month-long rally is ending. Without that, traders will continue to expect at least slightly higher prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied for 4 hours. It is again above the July 9 high, which was the top of a small wedge rally.<p>The bulls want today to close above yesterday’s high. Today would then be a breakout day. Traders would then look for a measured move up. That would lead to a test of the March 9 high.<p>The odds of a test of the March 9 high will be higher if today grows into a big bull day closing far above yesterday’s high. But the minimum that the bulls want is a close above yesterday’s high. They therefore will buy pullbacks today.<p>The rally has been having 10 – 15 pip pullbacks after every few bars. Also, the bull bars are not particularly big. Traders see that rally as not very strong. Also, the EURUSD is stuck at yesterday’s high. This increases the chance of the EURUSD entering a trading range around yesterday’s high.<p>However, today is still in a bull channel on the 5 minute chart. Therefore, it is easier for day traders to make money as buyers.<p>But if the EURUSD begins to have 20 – 30 pip pullbacks, day traders will begin to sell for scalps. If there is a trading range that lasts a couple hours, the bears will have a chance of a reversal down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and broad bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That was a High 2 bottom. It rallied for the rest of the day.<p>The rally was in a broad bull channel and the bears sold reversals down from new highs all day.<p>However, the day closed near its high and today is a big bull bar on the daily chart. It erased most of yesterday’s bearishness. Today is now a buy signal bar for tomorrow. But, the Emini has been in a tight trading range for 7 days. That reduces the chance of a big bull trend tomorrow.<p>With today’s Big Up after yesterday’s Big Down, there is Big Confusion. That increases the chance of trading range price action tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There are now consecutive failed island bottom attempts.<p>In addition, the month-long wedge rally is reversing down from a double top with the June high, which is a common reversal combination. Also, the Emini reversed down from above the 2019 close. Finally, yesterday closed near its low and it therefore a good sell signal bar for today.<p>If the bears can get follow-through selling over the next few days, this week will probably be the start of a pullback to the middle of the 3 year trading range.<p>One problem that the bears have is that yesterday was a big bar on the daily chart and it closed near the bottom of a 7 day tight trading range. A big bar means big risk.<p>Also, selling at the bottom of a tight trading range is a low probability bet. Therefore, yesterday is not as bearish as it might seem. The bears need strong follow-through today. Otherwise, traders will believe that yesterday is just a brief pullback in a bull trend.<p>The bulls need a quick reversal back up today or tomorrow. If today is another big bear day, the odds will be in favor a test of the bottom of the month-long trading range.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 8 points in the Globex session. There might be a small gap down. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>The Emini had a sell climax yesterday. There is only a 25% chance of a big bear day that begins on the open today.<p>Traders know that there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour today. The bulls want a close above the open so that today would have a bull body on the daily chart. That would reduce the chance of a successful reversal down on the daily chart. If today closes near its high, traders will suspect that yesterday was a bear trap and that the rally up to the February gap is intact.<p>But if today closes near its low, and especially if it is a big bear day, traders will expect a test down to the bottom of the month-long trading range.<p>Traders do not yet know if yesterday’s bears are exhausted. But they believe that the bears will begin to take some profits before the end of the 2nd hour.<p>Once the bears take profits, the bear trend typically ends for at least a couple hours. That usually leads to a period of confusion, which means a trading range. Traders will then look for either a reversal up or a resumption down.<p>The most important price today will be the open. The bears want a bear body on the daily chart and the bulls want a bull body.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-at-2019-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal at 2019 close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-small-pullback-bull-trend-but-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-14-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex small pullback bull trend but in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since June 19. However, it is still in a month-long trading range. Therefore, the probability of a successful breakout above the March 9 high is only slightly better than 50%. But if the bulls get consecutive closes above that high, traders will conclude that the yearlong trading range has ended and a bull trend has begun.<p>The bears want to get a reversal down. They prefer to get it from below the June 10 or March 9 highs. Most importantly, they need to reverse the trend before there are consecutive closes above the March 9 high. They do not want traders to believe that the EURUSD has evolved into a strong bull trend.<p>The bears need a couple big bear days for traders to conclude that the month-long rally is ending. Without that, traders will continue to expect at least slightly higher prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied for 4 hours. It is again above the July 9 high, which was the top of a small wedge rally.<p>The bulls want today to close above yesterday’s high. Today would then be a breakout day. Traders would then look for a measured move up. That would lead to a test of the March 9 high.<p>The odds of a test of the March 9 high will be higher if today grows into a big bull day closing far above yesterday’s high. But the minimum that the bulls want is a close above yesterday’s high. They therefore will buy pullbacks today.<p>The rally has been having 10 – 15 pip pullbacks after every few bars. Also, the bull bars are not particularly big. Traders see that rally as not very strong. Also, the EURUSD is stuck at yesterday’s high. This increases the chance of the EURUSD entering a trading range around yesterday’s high.<p>However, today is still in a bull channel on the 5 minute chart. Therefore, it is easier for day traders to make money as buyers.<p>But if the EURUSD begins to have 20 – 30 pip pullbacks, day traders will begin to sell for scalps. If there is a trading range that lasts a couple hours, the bears will have a chance of a reversal down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and broad bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That was a High 2 bottom. It rallied for the rest of the day.<p>The rally was in a broad bull channel and the bears sold reversals down from new highs all day.<p>However, the day closed near its high and today is a big bull bar on the daily chart. It erased most of yesterday’s bearishness. Today is now a buy signal bar for tomorrow. But, the Emini has been in a tight trading range for 7 days. That reduces the chance of a big bull trend tomorrow.<p>With today’s Big Up after yesterday’s Big Down, there is Big Confusion. That increases the chance of trading range price action tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, yesterday rallied in a bull trend and it closed near its high. It erased Monday’s bearishness and it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today on the daily chart.<p>I have been talking about the February 24 big gap down on both the daily and weekly charts since it formed. For the past 2 months, I said that the rally would probably have to test into the gap before the bears can get a correction back to the middle of the 3 year trading range.<p>Over the past month, the bears have made several attempts to reverse down from below that gap. Yesterday significantly increased the odds that the rally will reach that gap within a couple weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 45 points in the Globex session. It will therefore have a big gap up. In fact, it might gap above the June high. It is currently only 10 points below the gap above the February 24 high. Traders expect it to enter that gap today.<p>There is an increased chance of a trend day when there is a big gap up. A bull trend is slightly more likely than a bear trend.<p>When there is a big gap up on the 5 minute chart, the Emini is far above the EMA. That is its recent average price. Many traders do not want to pay a price that is far above average unless the early bars are far above average in their bullishness.<p>When there is a big gap up or down, there is only a 20% chance of a strong trend up or down from the 1st bar. Much more often, the Emini enters a trading range for an hour or two. The bears look for a wedge rally or a double top and then a reversal down.<p>The bulls want the Emini to go sideways or down to around the EMA. They then look to buy a reversal up from a double bottom or a wedge bottom for a swing up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-15.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and broad bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is breaking above a month-long bull flag and it is now testing the March 9 high. That is the top of a yearlong trading range. If the bulls can get consecutive closes above that high, traders will conclude that the 2 year bear trend has ended.<p>The bears want a double top with the March 9 high. After 3 bull days closing near their highs (if today closes near its high), they will probably need a micro double top in addition to the double top. Therefore, traders expect The EURUSD to go at least a little more sideways to up this week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied in a Bull Trending Trading Range pattern today. There was a trading range early overnight, a bull breakout, and now another trading range. This is the weakest type of bull trend because the chart is mostly sideways with only a brief rally in between 2 trading ranges.<p>Since the EURUSD has been in the upper trading range for several hours, day traders are scalping small reversals up and down. However, the day is still in a bull trend. Consequently, the bulls have a slightly better probability of making money.<p>The bears want a reversal down. If today closes on its low, traders will conclude that the break above the June high will probably fail. At a minimum, they want today to close off its high and below the June 10 high. If they get that, they will have a better chance of getting a reversal down within a few days. At the moment, traders expect a test of the March high within 2 weeks.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day after high 1 bull flag buy signal bar\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After a Low 2 top, it sold of to just below yesterday’s high, closing today’s gap up. It then rallied back to just below the open of the day. Today was a trading range day.<p>The February 24 gap on the weekly chart is an important magnet above. The Emini got within 9 points today. It should get there within a week, even if there is a day or two pullback first.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

After selling off and barely closing the gap, it rallied to back near the open of the day. It was a trading range day. That is a weak entry bar for the bulls.<p>Traders continue to expect a test above the February 24 high, which is the bottom of a big gap on the weekly chart. The Emini will probably get there within a week, even if there is a day or two pullback before then.<p>But will it make a new all-time high? If it enters the gap, there will be a 50% chance of a new high within a month. But whether or not there is a new high, traders should expect a pullback to the middle of the 3 year trading range ahead of the November election. Since the Emini is around where it sold off in February, traders wonder if it will sell off again from this level.<h3>Double top but weak sell setup</h3><p>The bears see yesterday as a sell signal bar for a micro double top with Monday’s high. They also see the 3 week rally as forming a double top with the June high.<p>But yesterday was only a bear doji bar. That is a weak sell signal bar. Also, the February 24 gap is a strong magnet above. Consequently, traders expect at least slightly higher prices before there will be a reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 25 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap below yesterday’s low. If it does, the gap will be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour and are insignificant.<p>Traders know that the Emini’s 4 month rally has been extreme and it is now in the area where it sold off in February. That increases the chance of a big selloff again. It can come at any time.<p>But with yesterday being a weak sell signal bar and with the February 24 gap being a strong magnet above, traders expect at least slightly higher prices over the next few days. This is true even if today is a bear trend day. More likely, today will continue yesterday’s trading range behavior and have at least one swing up and one swing down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-trading-range-day-after-high-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-16.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day after high 1 bull flag buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But it is also at the top of a yearlong trading range and the rally is a possible wedge.<p>If the bears get a reversal from this area, there would be a double top with the March 9 high and a wedge top. That would likely lead to a couple legs down over the next few weeks. At a minimum, the bears would expect a test of the June 9 bottom of the June trading range.<p>The monthly chart (not shown) has been in a bear channel for 2 years and a trading range for 1 year. If the bulls can get consecutive closes on the daily chart above the March 9 high, traders will conclude that the bear trend has ended. The monthly chart would then be in a trading range and possibly a bull trend. Therefore, what happens over the next couple weeks is important for the monthly chart.<p>There is no top yet and there still is room to the March 9 high. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight sold off to below yesterday’s low, but reversed back up to the open of the day. The bulls want the day to close near the high so that it would be a stronger buy signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Every time there is a one or two day pullback, the bulls see it as a buy signal. They want today to be another buy signal on the daily chart.<h3>Will today be a good buy signal bar on the daily chart?</h3><p>Today’s range has been small. The bulls do not need a big bull trend day. They just want today to close above the open so that there will be a bull body on the daily chart. That would attract more buyers tomorrow.<p>The bears need more than a small bear body if this is going to be the start of a reversal down. Since there already has been a reversal up overnight, the bears will probably not get a reversal down today.<p>They know today will be a buy signal bar on the daily chart. But they want it to be weak. If they can get the day to close below the open, the candlestick on the daily chart will have a bear body.<p>Traders would be less willing to buy tomorrow. The bears might then be able to create a micro double top within the next few days. If they can, there will have a better chance of getting a reversal down.<p>With today’s range being small, day traders have been scalping. Because of the reversal up a few hours ago, day traders will remain more interested in buying pullbacks than in selling rallies until the EURUSD begins to go sideways.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-double-bottom-and-tight-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and tight trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then went sideways and today was a trading range day. There was a late rally that failed and today closed just below the open.<p>Today is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. But it is small bear doji and yesterday was a bear doji. That reduces the chance of a big rally tomorrow.<p>The bears are hoping that the micro double top is the start of a reversal down to the middle of the 3 month rally. But with a weak sell signal bar yesterday, a weak entry bar today, and a strong magnet above, any reversal down will probably be minor. Traders expect a test into the gap above the February 24 high within a week.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The Emini has been oscillating around the open of the week so that is a magnet.

Traders see a 3 day micro double top and a double top with the June high.<p>But yesterday was a small trading range day. That is a weak entry bar for the bears. Also, Wednesday was a doji bar, which is a weak sell signal bar. Finally, the gap above the February 24 high is a strong magnet above. Consequently, traders expect a test into that gap this month.<p>Yesterday was a one day pullback in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. But it was only a small bear bar. Also the Emini is just below the top of a 2 month trading range. This is not a strong buy setup, even though the Emini will probably work higher over the next week.<h3>Weekly support and resistance</h3><p>Today is the final day of the week. It affects the appearance of the candlestick on the weekly chart.<p>The week has spent a lot of time around the open of the week. If it closes there, this week will be a doji bar on the weekly chart.<p>The bulls want the week to close on its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>The low of the week is probably out of reach. The best the bears can probably do is get a close below the open of the week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. It is being drawn up to the magnet of that gap on the weekly chart. It should get there today or within a few days. There is therefore an increased chance of a bull trend day.<p>Can today be a 3rd consecutive bear day on the daily chart? Of course, but traders expect a test above the February 24 high before there is more than a few days of selling. Consequently, the odds favor higher prices.<p>Yesterday was a trading range day. Also, as a doji day on the daily chart, it is a weak buy signal bar. Trading range days are more common than trend days. Therefore, day traders expect at least one swing up and one swing down today.<p>The 2 most powerful magnetic forces today are the gap above the February 24 high and the open of the week. The Emini might spend today in a trading range between those magnets and then get drawn to one of them in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-double-bottom-and-tight-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-17.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and tight trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday was another small pullback. There is no top yet and the March high is major resistance and therefore a strong magnet. Traders expect the rally to get there next week.<p>The bears want a micro double top with Wednesday’s high. They would see that as a lower high double top with the March high. Furthermore, the rally from the March low has had 3 legs up. It is therefore a wedge. The 2nd leg up in a double top often is a wedge rally. If the bears get a strong reversal day next week, it would be a credible sell setup for a test down to the June 19 bottom of the June trading range. Currently, the odds favor the bulls for at least another day or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied over the past 5 hours. Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart. Since it has a bear body and its high is far above today’s low, it is not a strong buy setup for today. Also, it is only 12 pips above today’s high. This combination of facts means that the EURUSD will probably not go much higher today. Consequently, it will probably enter a trading range.<p>Because the 5 hour rally has been strong, day traders have only been buying. But day traders do not think there is much left to the upside today. They expect a trading range.<p>The bears will begin to look for sell scalps. Because today is a bull trend, the bulls will continue to buy. But with a trading range likely, they will switch to buying 10 – 20 pip pullbacks and scalping.<p>Today could always reverse down. But it will probably have to transition into a trading range for a couple hours first.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-weak-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Traders see a 3 day micro double top and a double top with the June high.<p>But yesterday was a small trading range day. That is a weak entry bar for the bears. Also, Wednesday was a doji bar, which is a weak sell signal bar. Finally, the gap above the February 24 high is a strong magnet above. Consequently, traders expect a test into that gap this month.<p>Yesterday was a one day pullback in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. But it was only a small bear bar. Also the Emini is just below the top of a 2 month trading range. This is not a strong buy setup, even though the Emini will probably work higher over the next week.<h3>Weekly support and resistance</h3><p>Today is the final day of the week. It affects the appearance of the candlestick on the weekly chart.<p>The week has spent a lot of time around the open of the week. If it closes there, this week will be a doji bar on the weekly chart.<p>The bulls want the week to close on its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>The low of the week is probably out of reach. The best the bears can probably do is get a close below the open of the week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. It is being drawn up to the magnet of that gap on the weekly chart. It should get there today or within a few days. There is therefore an increased chance of a bull trend day.<p>Can today be a 3rd consecutive bear day on the daily chart? Of course, but traders expect a test above the February 24 high before there is more than a few days of selling. Consequently, the odds favor higher prices.<p>Yesterday was a trading range day. Also, as a doji day on the daily chart, it is a weak buy signal bar. Trading range days are more common than trend days. Therefore, day traders expect at least one swing up and one swing down today.<p>The 2 most powerful magnetic forces today are the gap above the February 24 high and the open of the week. The Emini might spend today in a trading range between those magnets and then get drawn to one of them in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-double-bottom-and-tight-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-17.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and tight trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday was another small pullback. There is no top yet and the March high is major resistance and therefore a strong magnet. Traders expect the rally to get there next week.<p>The bears want a micro double top with Wednesday’s high. They would see that as a lower high double top with the March high. Furthermore, the rally from the March low has had 3 legs up. It is therefore a wedge. The 2nd leg up in a double top often is a wedge rally. If the bears get a strong reversal day next week, it would be a credible sell setup for a test down to the June 19 bottom of the June trading range. Currently, the odds favor the bulls for at least another day or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied over the past 5 hours. Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart. Since it has a bear body and its high is far above today’s low, it is not a strong buy setup for today. Also, it is only 12 pips above today’s high. This combination of facts means that the EURUSD will probably not go much higher today. Consequently, it will probably enter a trading range.<p>Because the 5 hour rally has been strong, day traders have only been buying. But day traders do not think there is much left to the upside today. They expect a trading range.<p>The bears will begin to look for sell scalps. Because today is a bull trend, the bulls will continue to buy. But with a trading range likely, they will switch to buying 10 – 20 pip pullbacks and scalping.<p>Today could always reverse down. But it will probably have to transition into a trading range for a couple hours first.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-weak-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It broke to a new high late in the day, but closed just below the open.<p>The past 2 Monday’s gapped up on the weekly chart. That created a 4 month island bottom with the February 24 gap down.

Many bears have been waiting for that test. Once in the gap, there is a 50% chance of a new high and a 50% chance of a correction down to 2700.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>have been in a tight trading range for 4 months after reversing down in March from the most extreme buy climax in history. Bonds have been drifting up, but they will probably stay in a range for the rest of the year.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has rallied in a wedge bull channel to the March high on the weekly chart. But even if the bulls break above the March high, the EURUSD will probably be in a trading range for the next year. The top of the range should be around 1.18 and the September 2018 high, which was the start of the 2 year bear channel.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures weekly chart:</strong><br>Weak rally to top of 4 month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-double-top-at-top-of-4-month-tight-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-18.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has double top at top of 4 month tight trading range.png\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures market has rallied for 7 weeks on the weekly chart. The bulls hope that this is a resumption of the 2020 bull trend. But so far, the rally does not have consecutive big bull bars closing on their highs. It looks like a leg in the 4 month trading range and it is now simply testing the top of the range.<p>The bulls need a couple big bull bars closing on their highs to convince traders that the bull trend is resuming. There is currently a 60% chance that it is not, at least not yet.<h3>4 month tight trading range on the monthly chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-4-month-tight-trading-range-after-buy-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-18-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart has 4 month tight trading range after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>It is important to understand that the January to March rally was the most extreme buy climax on the monthly chart in the history of the bond market. The huge reversal down in late March is a sign that the bulls aggressively took profits.<p>When there is an extreme profit-taking selloff after an extreme buy climax, traders are confused. Will the bulls buy again, creating a resumption of the bull trend, or has the bull trend ended? No one knows.<p>However, traders believe that the bulls are exhausted. Exhausted bulls like to see the bears make a couple credible attempts to create a bear trend before thinking about buying again. These 2 legs down typically take about 10 bars, which is around a year on the monthly chart. Therefore, the bond market will probably be sideways for the remainder of the year.<h3>What happens after a year of sideways trading?</h3><p>What happens after a year of 2 legs of sideways to down trading? Traders will decide if the 2 legs down are the start of a bigger move down or simply a bull flag.<p>If the selloff does not look particularly strong, the bulls will buy again. But even if they get a new all-time high, it will probably be small and brief.<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"America will not tolerate negative interest rates (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">America will not tolerate negative interest rates</a>and that will keep a cap on bond prices.<p>Also, if there is a new high, it would be the 3rd leg up from the 2018 low. Furthermore, the 3 year bull channel has been tight. Consequently, traders will then expect a reversal down from a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>What if March was the end of a 30 year bull trend? The 1st target for the bears is the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the January low. Since that is far below the current price and the bond market now has small bars, the bears will probably need a year to get there.<p>Below that is the bottom of the 2014 – 2018 trading range. A trading range late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. Its low is a magnet once there is a reversal down. If the selloff to the January low continues down, the next target is the 2018 low. Because that is far below the current price, the bond market would probably need 2 – 3 years to get there.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex weekly chart:</strong><br>4 month rally, but possible wedge rally to a double top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-wedge-rally-to-double-top-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-18-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart wedge rally to double top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart has rallied for 2 weeks after forming an ii bull flag in early July. An ii pattern is a pair of consecutive inside bars. It is a Breakout Mode pattern. Since the breakout has been to the upside, it is an ii bull flag.<p>The breakout above the June high is good for the bulls. They want the rally to break above the March high. Not only that, they want consecutive closes above the March high. They would prefer those closes to be far above that high. If they succeed, traders will conclude that the 2017 bull trend is resuming.<h3>Possible wedge rally to a double top</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market rallied strong in late March. The top of the March 27 big bull bar might be the 1st leg up in a wedge rally. June 10 is a possibly 2nd leg. This coming week could be the 3rd and final leg of the wedge bull channel. If the bears get a reversal down in the next couple weeks, it will be from a wedge rally on the daily chart.<p>Also, the July rally would then be a double top with the March high. It is important to note that the 2nd leg up in a double top often is a wedge rally. There is then both a double top and a wedge top. That has a higher probability of leading to a 2 – 4 week selloff. Furthermore, if there is a selloff, it will probably have at least a couple legs down and test the bottom of the June/July trading range around 1.1150.<h3>Trading range on monthly chart is more likely than a bull trend</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-4-month-rally-in-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-18-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart in 4 month rally in bear trend\"></a></figure><p>There is a 30% chance of the bulls achieving their goal of resuming the 2017 bull trend. Why is it not higher? Because the 2 year bear trend was a Spike and Channel pattern on the monthly chart.<p>The channel began with the September 2018 high, just above 1.18. When there is a reversal up from a Spike and Channel bear trend, the rally typically tests the start of the bear channel and then the rally stalls. Traders expect a trading range for many bars afterwards.<p>This means that the 2 year bear channel will probably be simply a bear leg in a 3 – 5 year trading range. It also means that the current rally will probably be a bull leg in that same trading range. Finally, the trading will will probably last many months after it tests the September 2018 high, if it gets there.<p>Has the 2 year bear trend ended? After 3 consecutive months that have traded above the high of the prior month, it probably has. The bear trend can resume or the 4 month rally could be the start of a bull trend. But because of the Spike and Bear Channel, the EURUSD monthly chart will probably be sideways for at least another year.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Probably sellers above the June high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-4-month-rally-to-top-of-3-year-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-18-4.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly candlestick chart in 4 month rally to top of 3 year trading range\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has rallied strongly for 4 months from the below the bottom of its 3 year trading range. It is now just below the top of the trading range.<p>I have made the point many times that the size of the bodies has been shrinking from April through June. That is not what bulls want to see. The shrinking bodies represent a loss of momentum.<p>If you are a bull, you want the rally to continue to far above the old high. Ideally, you want the bodies to stay big or even get bigger. Also, you want each bar to close on or near its high. That indicates that traders are buying right up to the final days of the month. They do that because they are confident of higher prices in the next month. Because that did not happen in June, there might be more sellers than buyers above the June high.<p>Shrinking bodies and a big tail on top of a bar, like June, indicate that traders are selling before the end of the month. The selling is a combination of bulls taking profits and the bears betting on a reversal down.<p>Why would the bulls take profits if they believe the next month will be higher? They wouldn’t. Consequently, a lot of bulls are unwilling to take that bet. This hesitation on the part of the bulls increases the chance of a reversal back down to the middle of the 3 year range.<h3>In a trading range, traders expect reversals</h3><p>When the stock market is in a trading range, traders expect reversals up from around prior lows and down from around prior highs. There is often a breakout before the reversal. That happened with the February high and with the March low. Therefore, if there is going to be a reversal down this summer, it might come from above the February high instead of from a lower high.<p>I have written many times that the small body in June and the big tail on top of the June candlestick made it probable that July would not close far above the June high. This is true even though July has broken above the June high.<p>The month is only half over and the bulls can still get a huge bull bar in July. So far, July is trading at the high of the month. But there are 2 weeks left and the month can look very different once the candlestick closes.<p>For example, June had a big bull body early in the month. It reversed down strongly on June 11 and never got back to the high of the month. This created the big tail on the top of June’s candlestick by the end of the month.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Testing the February 24 gap, but probably not much higher</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-weekly-candlestick-chart-4-week-rally-testing-February-big-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-18-5.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly candlestick chart 4 week rally testing February big gap\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a bull trend for 4 months. The V bottom rally is now near the February all-time high, which is also the top of a 3 year trading range.<p>There was a huge gap down on the weekly and daily charts on February 24. Since that time, I said that a huge gap at the start of a strong bear trend is an important magnet. I thought that the Emini would get back there within a couple years. Instead, it is reaching the target after just 6 months.<p>While the bears have been trying to get a reversal down for 7 weeks, their attempts have failed. The Emini is still in a 4 month Small Pullback Bull Trend on the weekly chart.<p>Since early June, I have said that many traders will keep buying every reversal down because they expect that the Emini cannot escape the magnetic pull of that gap. Why sell below the gap if you think that the Emini will go higher and reach the gap?<p>Will the rally continue up to a new high? That really does not matter. Unless the Emini breaks strongly above the old high, it will probably begin to turn down from somewhere above the February 24 high. The top could be above or below the February high.<h3>2 failed attempts at an island bottom</h3><p>The Emini did something subtle but important in both of the past 2 weeks. It gapped up on Monday. This formed a 4-month island bottom with the February gap down. However, the gap closed by the end of the day, ending the island bottom. It did the same thing the week before.<p>It is very unusual to make 2 consecutive attempts at an island bottom and have both fail. This is important, but easy to overlook. It is a sign that something is wrong with the bulls.<p>The Emini might gap up again on Monday, July 20. That would be the 3rd consecutive week when the bulls tried to create a 4 month island bottom.<p>Even if there is a gap up and it stays open all week, the location at the top of a 3 year trading range is bad for the bulls. Therefore, the July gap up will probably close within a couple weeks.<p>These failed attempts at a strong bull breakout increase the chance of a reversal down this summer. However, it probably will not happen until after the Emini tests into the gap above the February 24 high.<h3>Trading range price action since April</h3><p>The candlesticks since late April are weaker than those of the 1st 4 weeks of the rally up from the March low. There have been many bars with prominent tails or bear bodies. Also, the Emini went sideways for several bars in May and again in June.<p>This type of price action is more common when the rally will end up being in a trading range. The rally is probably a bull leg that will become part of a trading range. Traders therefore expect a bear leg to begin this summer.<h3>Targets for the bears</h3><p>If there is a bear leg, it could simply test down to the June 15 higher low. That is the bottom of a 5 week trading range and the bottom of the most recent leg up. A trading range late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. Its low is a reasonable target for a retracement.<p>When a rally in a trading range reverses, the selloff often reaches the start of the trading range bars. That is the April 24 doji candlestick on the weekly chart. The low of that bar came on April 21.<p>Additionally, a bear leg in the 3 year trading range should test down to around the middle of the range. That also is around that April 21 low, and that is about a 50% retracement of the 4 month rally.<p>Finally, it is 20% down from the all-time high. If the market is 20% below the high, it is in a bear market. Therefore, that is also an important price. Markets like to test important prices. If there is a reversal down from around the February 24 gap or the all-time high, traders will look for a move down to 2700 – 2800.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Weak rally to the February 24 gap</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-daily-candlestick-chart-testing-February-big-gap-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-18-6.png\" alt=\"Emini daily candlestick chart testing February big gap\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a weak rally since the June 15 low. But it has also been sideways since early June. The bulls hope that the 4 month rally will continue up to a new all-time high.<p>However, the bears expect a double top with the February all-time high. They do not care if the 2nd high is a little above or below the February high. Legs in trading ranges often extend beyond the range before reversing. It would surprise no one if the reversal down came from a new high.<p>The bears believe that this rally is an exhaustive buy climax and that the 3 year trading range is intact. Trading ranges have legs up and down. The bears see the 4 month rally as just a leg in the 3 year trading range and therefore are looking for a bear leg to begin soon.<h3>The importance of the February 24 gap</h3><p>The gap above the February 24 high is big and it was the start of the pandemic crash. It is therefore a very important price.<p>When the Emini gets close to an important support or resistance level, traders like to see the move reach that level before looking for a reversal. Many bears feel this way. If enough do, there could be aggressive selling from above the February 24 high.<p>The bears might wait a week or more to see if the break into the gap will be strong enough to continue up to a new high. But at some point, if the Emini stalls, there might be strong selling. The bulls who bought wisely back in late March will take profits. Those who bought poorly in February will give up on their hope of getting out at their entry price, and they too will sell. Finally, many bears think that this rally will form a double top with the February high.<p>No one yet knows if the selling will be enough to begin correction back down to the middle of the 3 year range. However, whenever the market is deciding between a big breakout and a big reversal, traders assume that there is a 50% chance of either outcome.<h3>The un-importance of the election</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/President-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-18-7.png\" alt=\"stock market rallied under democrat presidents\"></a></figure><p>You cannot ignore the election, which theoretically affects the stock market. But much less than people think. I posted the above chart 2 weeks ago to show how much stronger the stock market was under Clinton and Obama than under the 2 Bushes and Trump.<p>You could surmise that republicans mess things up. But the correct conclusion is that the president’s party is not important.<p>The economy is sacred to the American people. No president is going to screw it up. We’ve designed a system that minimizes the damage any one idiot can do, no matter how much he tries to please his base and ignore everything else.<p>Trump is campaigning on how bad Biden will be for the stock market. Well, most people believe Biden is going to win the election. If he was going to be terrible, the Emini would be down at the March low, not up at the all-time high. No one cares.<p>It does not matter if Trump or Biden wins. American businesses are far more important than whatever fool lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The only reason rich people care who wins is because politics are fun and they want someone as president who shares their values. They do not believe the outcome will affect their portfolios all that much. The stock market is telling us that.<h3>Is July going to be the top for several months?</h3><p>The timing of this is interesting. Since the Emini got within 10 points of the gap this week, it will probably enter the gap in July. Also, there is a tendency for the market to have selloffs in the August through October time frame. The 1929 Crash and the 1987 Crash both were in October. Both crashes had more than a 10% selloff in August. We are entering that window. Also, as I said, the Emini is overbought and it might try to become more neutral ahead of the election.<p>All of these factors favor a reversal down to the middle of the 3 year trading range within a few months. Larry Williams, who is a well-known trader, uses his own reasoning to come to a similar conclusion. He recently said that he expects the market to<a aria-label=\"rally into around July 27 and then turn down (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/jim-cramer-charts-suggest-sp-500-climb-will-stall-out-in-late-july.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">rally to around the old high into around July 27 and then turn down</a>.<p>But why is the market still going up? Liquidity. I have said many times that the single most important factor over the past 4 months is Fed Governor<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-and-economy-best-and-worst-case-scenarios-60-minutes-2020-03-22/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Neel Kashkari's statement on 60 Minutes  (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Neel Kashkari’s statement on 60 Minutes</a>in March that the Fed has “an infinite amount of cash” to protect the economy. But as powerful as the Fed is, it will not bother to stop a 15% correction. Therefore, a pullback to 2700 can take place, despite the Fed’s proclamation.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is trading just below the February 24 high, which is the bottom of the big gap down on the weekly chart.<p>Traders expect the Emini to enter that gap this week. Then, there will be a 50% chance of a new high and a 50% chance of a reversal down to the middle of the 3 year trading range.<p>Each of the past 2 Monday’s gapped up on the open, but the gap closed during the day. The gap up created a 4 month island bottom with the February gap down.<p>The Emini might gap up again today in a 3rd consecutive attempt to create an island bottom on the weekly chart. But whether it does and whether the gap closes, traders expect a test into that February gap. It will probably come this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 4 points in the Globex session. That is about 15 points below last week’s high. Consequently, the Emini will probably not gap up on the weekly chart. However, the Small Pullback Bull Trend is still intact on the daily chart. Therefore, traders continue to expect the Emini to work to above the February 24 high before the end of the month.<p>The past 3 days were bear dojis on the daily chart. That means that they were trading range days on the 5 minute chart. While three sideways days is a Breakout Mode pattern, 3 consecutive trading range days increase the chances of more sideways trading today. This is especially true with today probably opening within Friday’s range.<p>Everyone knows that the Emini is overbought and at the top of a 3 year trading range. There is therefore an increased potential for either a big trend day up or down. But traders expect trading range trading unless there is a series of big trend bars up or down on the 5 minute chart.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-weak-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-20.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-nested-wedge-and-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-20-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex nested wedge and double top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied for 4 months. It has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for 4 weeks. It is testing the March high, which is the highest high in over a year.<p>However, the rally over the past month has had 3 legs up. It is therefore a wedge.<p>This wedge is nested within a bigger wedge that began on March 27. This nested wedge it testing a major high and therefore there is a potential double top with the March 9 high.<p>While the bull trend is good for the bulls, a nested wedge to a double top is good for the bears. This represents tension.<p>When there is the potential for a strong top, there is also the potential for a strong bull breakout. Bullish traders expect a couple closes above the March high and then a swing up. However, the bears want a reversal down to at least to the June low. The move up or down will probably last at least a few weeks and cover at 300 or more pips. It will probably begin within a couple weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above last week’s high. This week is now the 3rd consecutive week that traded above the high of the prior week. This is a sign of persistent bulls.<p>But the EURUSD only went 16 pips above last week’s high. On the weekly chart, that is a small breakout.<p>Also, the 5 minute chart has been in a 25 pip trading range for 6 hours. Day traders have been scalping for 10 – 20 pips.<p>The day’s range is similar that of most days over the past 4 weeks. Consequently, the range will probably not increase significantly. Therefore, day traders are planning to scalp for the rest of the day. They will switch to swing trading if there is a strong breakout or reversal, but the odds are against that.<p>The bulls want the EURUSD to close above Friday’s high and last week’s high. That would increase the chances of higher prices tomorrow.<p>The bears want a reversal down to the low of the day. However, they would be satisfied with a close below Friday’s high. That would slightly increase the chance of sideways to down trading tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It formed the 1st bull day in 3 days and it closed above Friday’s high. It was the highest close since February.<p>The past month rallied in a wedge and the bears want a double top with the all-time high. However, the bulls want a strong break above the February high.<p>Something very important happened yesterday. The Emini finally entered the gap above the February 24 high. That was a big gap down on both the daily and weekly charts and the start of the pandemic crash. I have been saying that the Emini probably had to get there before traders would consider selling. We soon will find out just how many sellers are in the gap.<p>There is now a 50% chance of a new all-time high and a 50% chance of a reversal down to the middle of the 3 year trading range. The Emini might go sideways for a week or two in the gap before traders decide on the direction.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 23 points in the Globex session. It therefore will probably gap above yesterday’s high. If the gap is small, it will probably close in the 1st hour.<p>Yesterday’s rally was very strong. But that means it was extreme and therefore a type of a buy climax. There is only a 25% chance of consecutive strong bull trend days, but there is a 50% chance of some follow-through buying in the 1st 2 hours. Therefore, if today is another bull trend day, it will probably be a weaker type, like a Broad Bull Channel or a Bull Trending Trading Range day.<p>When there is a strong trend, the bulls typically begin to take profits. Day traders expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading to start by the end of the 2nd hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-21.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If there is, the next target is the September 2018 high just above 1.18 because that was the start of the 2 year bear channel.<h3>Nested wedge rally</h3><p>The past 5 days are largely overlapping one another and the bodies are small. This is a sign of a loss of momentum and it is coming at important resistance. A reversal down from here would be from a double top with the March 9 high.<p>When there is a reversal down from a double top, the 2nd rally often is a wedge. The March 27 high is the 1st of 3 legs up. The 2nd leg ended on June 10th. That makes the current month-long rally the 3rd leg up, and the rally from the March 23 low is therefore a wedge.<p>Furthermore, the 3rd leg up is itself a smaller wedge. A small wedge nested within a larger wedge increases the chance of a reversal down. If there is a reversal down, traders will look for a couple legs down lasting at least a couple weeks. The 1st target is the bottom of the 3rd leg up. That is the June 19 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down after barely going above yesterday’s high. It has been in a Triangle for 6 hours. Day traders are scalping reversals for 10 pips.<p>This triangle is in a month-long bull trend. It is therefore a bull flag. But it is also a sign of neutrality. Consequently, the bulls only have a 55% chance of an upside breakout. There a 45% chance it is a topping pattern.<p>If there is a bull breakout, a triangle late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. That reduces the chance of a big rally from here. It therefore increases the chance of a reversal down from here or from slightly above the March 9 high.<p>Because the EURUSD is at major resistance, day traders are ready for either a big breakout above the resistance or a big reversal down. However, until there is a breakout, they will continue to scalp reversals.<p>Today’s close is important. If today closes near its low, traders will begin to sell on the daily chart, looking for a reversal down to the June 19 low. But if today closes near its high and above yesterday’s high, traders will expect the rally to continue up to the March 9 high. That high is only 26 pips above today’s current high.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-trading-range-with-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-21-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That is still more likely that it rallying straight up to the old high or reversing down.<p>Traders expect an unknown number of sellers in this gap. Those sellers are the buyers from February who are happy to get out without much of a loss. They are also the buyers who bought early in the reversal up who are taking some profits.

Traders should know within 2 weeks if there are enough sellers to turn the Emini back down to the middle of the 3 year range.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It formed the 1st bull day in 3 days and it closed above Friday’s high. It was the highest close since February.<p>The past month rallied in a wedge and the bears want a double top with the all-time high. However, the bulls want a strong break above the February high.<p>Something very important happened yesterday. The Emini finally entered the gap above the February 24 high. That was a big gap down on both the daily and weekly charts and the start of the pandemic crash. I have been saying that the Emini probably had to get there before traders would consider selling. We soon will find out just how many sellers are in the gap.<p>There is now a 50% chance of a new all-time high and a 50% chance of a reversal down to the middle of the 3 year trading range. The Emini might go sideways for a week or two in the gap before traders decide on the direction.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 23 points in the Globex session. It therefore will probably gap above yesterday’s high. If the gap is small, it will probably close in the 1st hour.<p>Yesterday’s rally was very strong. But that means it was extreme and therefore a type of a buy climax. There is only a 25% chance of consecutive strong bull trend days, but there is a 50% chance of some follow-through buying in the 1st 2 hours. Therefore, if today is another bull trend day, it will probably be a weaker type, like a Broad Bull Channel or a Bull Trending Trading Range day.<p>When there is a strong trend, the bulls typically begin to take profits. Day traders expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading to start by the end of the 2nd hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-21.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The selloff at the end of the day closed yesterday’s gap up.<p>Because yesterday had a bear body, it is a sell signal bar for today. But the bull channel on the daily chart is tight and yesterday had a big tail below. Also, yesterday was the 2nd consecutive close above the February 24 high. This is a weak sell setup.<p>Because yesterday is a sell signal bar, today might have to go below its low to see if there are more sellers than buyers there. Remember, traders know that the gap on the weekly chart might be where the 4 month bull trend ends. However, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top on the daily chart before they can begin a reversal. Therefore, the bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>I have been saying that the Emini might have to go sideways for a week or more in the February gap on the weekly chart. It could take a while before traders decide if the 4 month rally will reach the old high or reverse back down to the middle of the 3 year trading range.<p>Therefore, today will probably be more of a trading range day and not a big bear day.

Also, traders know that today might have to go below yesterday’s low to trigger the sell signal on the daily chart.<p>However, there will probably be buyers not too far below because the daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Consequently, today will probably not be a big bear day.<p>Also, after yesterday’s strong selloff, there is a reduced chance of a big bull day. If today is not going to be a big bull day or big bear day, it will probably have a lot of trading range price action. This might continue for a week or more.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-trading-range-with-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-22.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today so far is the 2nd consecutive big bull bar closing on its high and above the March high. If today closes near its high, the 2 day breakout will be strong enough for traders to expect at least a small 2nd leg up after the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback. But if it closes below its midpoint, there is an increased chance that a 2 week pullback could begin this week.<p>When an exceptionally strong breakout comes late in a bull trend, it is usually climactic. That means it typically will attract some profit-taking, usually after a brief 2nd leg up.<p>Since this is the 3rd leg up, the bears want a major reversal down from a wedge top. But it is a strong breakout of a long base. Consequently, the best the bears can probably get over the next few weeks is a 2 week pullback to the June 10 high. That is a breakout point and it is around the EMA. Traders now expect the rally to continue up to the September 2018 high of around 1.18 over the next few months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been continuing yesterday’s rally. Today’s close is important. The more today closes near the high, the stronger the breakout on the daily chart. It would increase the chance of at least a small 2nd leg up after a a 2 – 3 day pullback.<p>The bulls will therefore buy pullbacks today. But today’s range is almost as big as yesterday’s. Today will probably not go much higher. They simply want today to close near its high.<p>The bears want today to close below the midpoint of the day’s range. That would be a sign that profit-taking is beginning. It would increase the chance of a pullback to the daily EMA and the June 10 high within a week or two. Consequently, the bears will sell reversals down from the high of the day.<p>Since today will probably not get much higher, yet the bulls want it to close near the high, the rally will probably evolve into a trading range within the next hour. After an hour or two of sideways trading, the bears would have a better chance of a reversal down to below the midpoint of today’s range. There is only a small chance of a big bear trend down to the low of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bull-channel-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was a trading range day with a late rally. The bulls want the 4 month rally to close the February gap and continue up to a new all-time high.<p>But there is a 50% chance of a reversal down from a lower high. With no credible top, traders expect sideways to up over the next few days.<p>Remember the monthly chart. June had big tail on the top of its monthly candlestick. That increases the chance of a tail on the top of July.

This might continue for a week or more.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-trading-range-with-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-22.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today so far is the 2nd consecutive big bull bar closing on its high and above the March high. If today closes near its high, the 2 day breakout will be strong enough for traders to expect at least a small 2nd leg up after the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback. But if it closes below its midpoint, there is an increased chance that a 2 week pullback could begin this week.<p>When an exceptionally strong breakout comes late in a bull trend, it is usually climactic. That means it typically will attract some profit-taking, usually after a brief 2nd leg up.<p>Since this is the 3rd leg up, the bears want a major reversal down from a wedge top. But it is a strong breakout of a long base. Consequently, the best the bears can probably get over the next few weeks is a 2 week pullback to the June 10 high. That is a breakout point and it is around the EMA. Traders now expect the rally to continue up to the September 2018 high of around 1.18 over the next few months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been continuing yesterday’s rally. Today’s close is important. The more today closes near the high, the stronger the breakout on the daily chart. It would increase the chance of at least a small 2nd leg up after a a 2 – 3 day pullback.<p>The bulls will therefore buy pullbacks today. But today’s range is almost as big as yesterday’s. Today will probably not go much higher. They simply want today to close near its high.<p>The bears want today to close below the midpoint of the day’s range. That would be a sign that profit-taking is beginning. It would increase the chance of a pullback to the daily EMA and the June 10 high within a week or two. Consequently, the bears will sell reversals down from the high of the day.<p>Since today will probably not get much higher, yet the bulls want it to close near the high, the rally will probably evolve into a trading range within the next hour. After an hour or two of sideways trading, the bears would have a better chance of a reversal down to below the midpoint of today’s range. There is only a small chance of a big bear trend down to the low of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bull-channel-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was a trading range day with a late rally. The bulls want the 4 month rally to close the February gap and continue up to a new all-time high.<p>But there is a 50% chance of a reversal down from a lower high. With no credible top, traders expect sideways to up over the next few days.<p>Remember the monthly chart. June had big tail on the top of its monthly candlestick. That increases the chance of a tail on the top of July.

The bulls are trying to close the February gap and then get a new all-time high. They have a 50% chance before a pullback to the middle of the 3 year range. Because the daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend, traders expect sideways to up trading for at least a couple more days.<p>The bears still have a 50% chance of a reversal down before there is a new high. Since the Emini is so close to the all-time high, the bears will probably need to start their reversal within a week, if they are to get a reversal.<p>The Emini might have to stay mostly sideways for a week or more before traders decide on whether the rally will continue up to the all-time high or reverse down to the middle of the 3 year range.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 3 points in the Globex session. Yesterday ended with a tight bull channel. A bull channel should be considered to be a bear flag since there is a 75% chance of a bear breakout. The breakout can come by the Emini going down or sideways.<p>Channels typically evolve into trading ranges. Also, all of the trading range price action of the past few days further increases the chance of trading range price action today.<p>The bulls want to close the February gap. The bottom of the gap is just above 3300. However, the 4 month rally is extreme and the gap was huge. This increases the chance of a reversal down for several weeks beginning within a couple weeks.<p>Markets typically stall when testing major resistance. That partly explains the recent trading range price action. It might continue for a few more days. But when the Emini is testing an important price, there is an increased chance of a surprisingly big trend up or down starting at any time.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bull-channel-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-23.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But the rally has had 3 climactic legs up. It is therefore a wedge and a buy climax. That typically will attract profit takers and lead to a pullback for a couple weeks.<p>Furthermore, the series of 4 bull bars closing on their highs and without much overlap is a very strong breakout. When there is a strong breakout late in a bull trend, that, too, attracts profit takers. However, there is often one more brief breakout after a 1 – 3 day pullback before the pullback begins.<p>Traders should expect exhaustion this week or next. That typically results in approximately a TBTL (Ten Bar, Two Leg) pullback. The 1st targets are the EMA and the breakout points. Those points are the March high and the June 10 high. The pullback will probably be about 200 pips.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight failed to get above yesterday’s high and reversed down to the low of the session. Because of the exhaustive buy climaxes on the daily chart, the bulls are starting to take profits and the bears are beginning to short.<p>Since the 4 day rally has been strong, the EURUSD will probably have to go sideways or up a little more before the 200 pip pullback begins. However, since it is imminent, day traders will be more willing to short than they have been for the past 2 weeks.<p>The overnight reversal down was strong enough to make at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down likely today. But the bulls will probably buy this 1st reversal down.<p>With traders buying selloffs and selling rallies for at least a day or two, the EURUSD should enter a trading range. Day traders will look for 10 – 20 pip scalps up and down.<p>Today’s open is important. Traders will look for bear bodies on the daily chart as a sign that the 2 week pullback might be beginning. Consequently, the open of the day will be a magnet. The bears want a close at least one pip below the open to create the 1st bear day in the past 5 day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-double-top-pullback-and-reversal-down-from-February-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double top pullback and reversal down from February gap\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It broke back below the February 24 high, which is the bottom of the weekly gap. The selloff also fell below the June high.<p>The selloff was a sell climax and a sell vacuum test of those support levels. The bulls need a strong reversal up tomorrow for traders to view this as a test. Otherwise, traders will suspect it is the end of the 4 month rally.<p>Today’s high was exactly at yesterday’s high and the low was below yesterday’s low. Today was therefore an outside down day. It is therefore a sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>I have been saying that the Emini might sell off at the end of July because the monthly chart. June had a tail on top and the bodies were shrinking.

It was an outside down day and it is therefore a sell signal bar for today.<p>I have been warning that the Emini might sell off at the end of July because of the monthly chart. The bodies have been shrinking and June has a big tail on top. Also, the Emini has now tested the gap on the weekly chart. They therefore have achieved an important goal and many will start taking profits.<p>The bulls want the rally to close the gap on the weekly chart. But traders are wondering if yesterday the start of a reversal down to the middle of the 3 year trading range. If there are 2 or 3 big bear days over the next few days, then it probably is. If not, if there is going to be a selloff before a new high, it will likely start before the end of next week, which is the end of the month.<h3>At support on the daily chart</h3><p>Yesterday sold off and stopped at a cluster of support levels on the daily chart. It tested the June high, the open of the week, and the close of 2019. These are magnets and the Emini might remain stuck here all day.<p>The most important price is the open of the week. Will the Emini finally get a bear body on the weekly chart after 3 bull bodies? The past 2 weeks had small bull bodies. So far, this week is a 3rd consecutive small bull body. The bears want a bear body. Today would then be a better sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<p>Remember, the 4 month bull trend might be ending this month. The odds will go up if there are bear bodies on the weekly and daily charts.<h3>Weekly support and resistance</h3><p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. With yesterday’s selloff, the week is now the 3rd consecutive doji bar on the weekly chart. If today closes below the open of the week, the week will have a bear body. It would then be a more reliable sell signal bar for next week. That would increase the chance of lower prices for next week.<p>The bulls still want to close the gap on the weekly chart. If today reverses up strongly, they might have a chance next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 11 points in the Globex session. It will open around yesterday’s low. If there is a small gap down, the gap will probably close in the 1st hour.<p>Yesterday ended with a trading range after a sell climax. That is an area of agreement. If there is a break below the trading range, the Emini will probably get drawn back into the range within a few hours. A trading range late in a bear trend is often the Final Bear Flag.<p>Every trading range has both a sell and a buy setup. The bulls want a major trend reversal up to undo yesterday’s sell climax. The bears want a double top bear flag and a 2nd consecutive big bear day.<p>Because yesterday collapsed but stopped abruptly at support, the Emini will probably stay around the support all day. That means a trading range day is more likely than a big trend day up or down.<p>There should be at least one swing up and one swing down today. If the Emini is within 20 points of the open of the week in the final hour, it will probably get drawn to it and then close either a little above or below it.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-double-top-pullback-and-reversal-down-from-February-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-24.png\" alt=\"Emini double top pullback and reversal down from February gap\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls will try to resume the trend, but after the big bull bars on Tuesday and Wednesday on the daily chart, traders will probably start to sell a 1 – 2 day rally to above yesterday’s high.<p>Because today is a small trading range day, day traders are scalping for 10 pips. While there always can be a breakout, the bulls are exhausted on the daily chart.

It was an outside down day and it is therefore a sell signal bar for today.<p>I have been warning that the Emini might sell off at the end of July because of the monthly chart. The bodies have been shrinking and June has a big tail on top. Also, the Emini has now tested the gap on the weekly chart. They therefore have achieved an important goal and many will start taking profits.<p>The bulls want the rally to close the gap on the weekly chart. But traders are wondering if yesterday the start of a reversal down to the middle of the 3 year trading range. If there are 2 or 3 big bear days over the next few days, then it probably is. If not, if there is going to be a selloff before a new high, it will likely start before the end of next week, which is the end of the month.<h3>At support on the daily chart</h3><p>Yesterday sold off and stopped at a cluster of support levels on the daily chart. It tested the June high, the open of the week, and the close of 2019. These are magnets and the Emini might remain stuck here all day.<p>The most important price is the open of the week.

There is a 50% chance of a reversal down to the middle 3rd of the 3 year trading range beginning within a few weeks before there is a new high.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>have worked higher relentlessly for 8 weeks. Even though the price is not much higher, the persistence increases the chance of a bull breakout. Small but relentless trends sometimes accelerate into clear, strong trends.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market broke to a new 52 week high and it is no longer in a bear trend. It should soon test 1.18, but it then might evolve into a big trading range.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures weekly chart:</strong><br>8 bar bull micro channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bond-futures-candlestick-chart-has-double-top-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-25.png\" alt=\"Bond futures candlestick chart has double top lower high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>This week’s low on the 30 year Treasury bond futures weekly chart was above last week’s low. This is the 7th consecutive week with rising lows. There is now an 8 week bull micro channel on the weekly chart.<p>It’s not perfect because the low 3 weeks ago was 3/32 below the low of the week before. But on the monthly chart, that is minimal. Most things in trading are less than perfect. But the closer they are to perfect, the more traders expect the market to behave like the perfect pattern. The rally is close enough to a micro channel to use that term.<p>While the price has not been rising quickly, the bulls have been persistent. It is important to remember that the chart is not just a price chart. It is 2 dimensional and time is the 2nd variable. Sometimes time is more important than price. Time can occasionally tell traders that a trend is beginning before price makes it clear. This could be an example.<h3>Possible short covering rally soon</h3><p>When there is a bull micro channel with very little gain in price, the bears short what they think is a weak bull trend. But it is not weak. What often happens is that the shorts get squeezed and the bull trend accelerate up.<p>The bears see that there is a lot of room to the March high and they do not want a huge loss. They become concerned by the persistent drift upward and buy back their losing shorts.<p>A bull micro channel often leads to an acceleration up due to short covering. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a near-term bull breakout above the 8 week bull channel.<h3>Monthly chart has High 1 bull flag</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-high-1-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-25-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart has high 1 bull flag\"></a></figure><p>I talked about June being a pullback from the rally to the March high. That made it a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. July triggered the buy by going above the June high. July is therefore the entry bar.<p>With one week remaining to the month, July is a bull bar closing above its midpoint. While is is not a big bull bar, if it looks like this when the month closes on Friday, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in August.<p>As climactic as the January to March rally was, it was still only a 2nd leg up. Buy climaxes often end as wedge tops, which means a 3rd leg up. The bulls are hoping that June was the start of the 3rd leg up to above the March high.<p>But unless either July or August is a big bull bar closing near its high, the 2 month rally will more likely form a lower high. The odds are that the March buy climax was extreme enough to lead to a yearlong trading range and not just a 3 month pullback.<h3>ii was a sell signal, but it is now a buy signal</h3><p>June broke below an ii pattern on the monthly chart after the reversal down from the March buy climax. April and May were consecutive inside bars (inside-inside, or ii), which is a Breakout Mode pattern. The sell signal triggered when June traded below the May low.<p>The bond futures this week broke above that ii. When an ii sell signal fails like this, the breakout above the ii is then a buy signal. In addition to the High 1 bull flag in June, there is now an ii buy signal in July.<p>That could be what the bulls need to accelerate up above the weekly bull micro channel. But if instead the bonds turn down next week, there would be a micro double top with the April high. This would be 2nd sell signal (the ii was the first). Traders should find out within the next 2 weeks.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex weekly chart:</strong><br>Strong breakout to new 52 week high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-breakout-to-52-week-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-25-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart breakout to 52 week high\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart has had consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs. In addition, this week closed far above the March high. That high was a 52 week high. More importantly, it was the final major lower high in the 2 year bear channel. Traders now believe that the 2 year bear trend has ended.<p>When a bear trend ends, a market is either in a bull trend or a trading range. It often is in both. At the moment, the rally is strong and traders see it as a bull trend.<p>The next target is the September 2018 high. That was the 1st pullback after the strong reversal down (bear spike) from the February 2018 high. It was therefore the start of the 2 year bear channel. The selloff from the February 2018 high was a Spike and Channel Bear Trend.<h3>Spike and Channel Bear Trend typically evolves into a trading range</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-resuming-2017-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-25-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart resuming 2017 bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The monthly chart is reversing up from a higher low major trend reversal. The bulls want the rally to continue to far above the February 2018 high.<p>But when a market reverses up from a bear channel, the 1st target is the start of the channel. Here, on the monthly chart, that is the September 2018 high of 1.1816. Once the rally reaches the target, the bulls often take profits.<p>Also, the bears know that a bear channel began at that price 2 years ago. They expect that traders will sell there again.<p>So there are bears selling into shorts as well as bulls selling out of longs. That typically results in at least a minor reversal down. It also generates confusion.<p>Consequently, what usually happens is that the rally stalls and the chart turns sideways. The rally becomes a leg in a big trading range, and traders look back at the 2 year bear channel as a bear leg in the trading range.<p>If the EURUSD Forex market stalls around 1.18, it will probably be in a trading range for at least another year. The top of the range should be around 1.18, but it might be back at the February 2018 high at around 1.25. The bottom is just about 1.06, but the odds are against a test of that level for at least a year.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Bull bar breaking above June high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-testing-top-of-3-year-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-25-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart testing top of 3 year trading range\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart in July so far is a bull bar closing near its high with one week remaining. It broke above the June high, but pulled back below that high at the end of the week.<p>It is important to note that June had a big tail on top. That represents profit taking, which means that the bulls were less aggressive.<p>Also, May had a smaller body than April and June had a smaller body than May. Shrinking bodies is a sign of loss of momentum.<p>This is taking place near the top of a 3 year trading range, which is resistance. The bulls can reestablish the momentum by having July close on its high and far above the June high. If the Emini simply goes sideways for the final week of July, the monthly bar will be strong. Traders will expect higher prices in August.<h3>Next week is important</h3><p>There is always a bear case. What happens if the tail on the top of June and the shrinking bodies are still important?<p>One sign of that would be if July closed far below the June high and had a big tail on top, like June. Traders would then see a micro double top with the June high and a big double top with the February high. They would suspect that August might trade down.<p>Consequently, this coming week is important because it can affect what August does. If the bears can get a strong reversal down, it could lead to further selling in August. But if the bulls can keep the Emini where it currently is, traders will look for a new all-time high in August.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Reversing down from within February gap</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-testing-February-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-25-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart testing February gap\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a bear doji bar this week. The bears hope that the bulls will finally take profits now that the rally entered the February gap.<p>This week is a sell signal bar for next week. But because it only had a small bear body, it is not a high probably sell signal. This is especially true since the 4 month rally is a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That is a strong bull trend and it resists reversing. The bulls still have a 50% chance that the rally will make a new high before there is more than a 2 bar pullback.<h3>The importance of the February gap</h3><p>Ever since the gap down on February 24, I have said that the gap would be an important price. It was a big gap down and the start of the coronavirus crash.<p>For the past 2 months, the Emini was close to the gap. I therefore said that the Emini would probably have to enter the gap before there would be a pullback that lasts more than a few days. The Emini this week entered the gap. That will catch the interest of bears who were waiting for the Emini to get there.<p>We do not yet know that there will be enough selling to create a reversal. But we should find out within a week or two.<h3>A big gap at the start of a trend is a strong magnet</h3><p>Because it was a big down, we knew traders were very eager to sell. All of the bulls who bought in February were instantly holding losing positions. Many held trough the crash and the V bottom reversal up.<p>Since the gap was so unusually big and it led to a crash, traders see it as very important. Once the Emini begun to get near it in June, many traders decided not to sell until after the Emini entered the gap. That relative lack of sellers meant the market had to go higher to find sellers. How much higher? Well, into the gap. Many traders are interested in selling there.<h3>Who is going to sell in the gap? Maybe everyone!</h3><p>The Emini finally entered the gap this week. Now we will find out what the bulls are thinking. Will the February bulls thank the heavens for allowing them to get out around breakeven? The 4 month rally has made them whole again. Will they be so exhausted by the collapse and sharp rally that they will choose to exit and wait to see what happens?<p>Traders know that there were a lot of sellers at this price in February. Markets have memory. Will many bears think this is still price to sell?<p>Finally, the smart bulls who bought at the March low need to take profits at some point. Will they conclude that a 40% gain in 4 months is so exceptional that it is unlikely to grow much more in the coming months? Many will not want to give back their windfall profits. Those bulls will sell out of their hugely profitable longs.<p>Will there be enough these 3 types of sellers to reverse the 4 month bull trend? We might find out over the next few weeks.<h3>How big will a pullback be?</h3><p>If the Emini repeatedly dips back below the February 24 high (the bottom of the gap), or reverses down strongly, traders will look for a pullback. The 1st reversal down in a strong bull trend is typically a pullback and not the start of a bear trend. When there is a pullback in a bull trend, a good rule of thumb is to expect it to retrace about half of the rally and about last half as long.<p>A 50% pullback is around 2700. Half of a 4 month rally is 2 months. Consequently, you can estimate what to expect if the Emini is going to reverse soon.<p>Using my simple guide, the initial estimate for a possible end of a selloff would be a month or two down to 2700. It could last 3 weeks or 3 months, and the bottom might be at 2800 or 2600. No one knows, but this is a good starting point when looking for a pullback.<p>Another generalization is that a pullback from a buy climax retraces approximately half of the rally about half of the time. In 25% of cases, the pullback is more like 1/3rd and in the other 25% of cases, it’s around 2/3rds. That is why I said 2600 – 2800.<p>Over the past month, I have given many other reasons to expect a pullback to around 2700. I will not repeat them today.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Wedge rally reversing down in February gap</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-wedge-rally-at-February-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-25-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily chart wedge rally at February gap\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had 3 consecutive closes this week above the February 24 high. That means that they were in the gap.<p>However, Thursday reversed down from within the gap. Since the 6 week rally has had 3 pushes up, it is a wedge and a buy climax. If the bears can get follow-through selling next week, they will probably get a reversal down to the middle of the 3 year trading range.<p>But since the rally is still in a Small Pullback Bull Trend, the bulls still have a 50% chance of a new all-time high before there is more than a few days down.<p>I have been saying that once the Emini entered the gap, there would be a 50% chance of a new high before there is a pullback lasting more than a few days. That is still true.<p>You often hear that all gaps close. However, the bulls have not yet closed the gap. Remember, for 2 months I have carefully said that the Emini should go above the February 24 high. That means I was expecting it to enter the gap. I never said it should go above the February 21 low, which would close the gap.<p>My thought was that traders thinking of selling in the gap did not care if it closed the gap. Besides, the top of the gap is very near the all-time high, which is a much more important price.<p>That is why I have only mentioned the bottom of the gap and the all-time high as major targets. If the Emini were to close the gap, it would probably quickly continue up to a new high, and that is a more important achievement.<h3>Do all gaps close?</h3><p>There is an adage on Wall St. that says “all gaps close.” It is important to understand that traders who have traded for decades (I have traded for 35 years) never use superlatives like always, never, all, or none.<p>Well, except one. I sometimes say, “Never say never or always.” That is because black swans exist and unimaginable things happen. They happen rarely, but they happen. One of the tenets of quantum physics is that there is a real possibility for everything imaginable, even if it is so small that it is realistically impossible.<p>Back to gaps. Every bear gap in history has closed, and the February gap will close as well. How can I say that? The world’s population and the world’s wealth have increased forever. That means the value of the market has continued up, even after an 89% loss in the Great Depression. There always has been a new high. Therefore every gap down gets closed.<p>But what about a gap up? The market has been in a bull trend forever. That means there have been many higher lows. If the market gapped up early in the rally from a low, that gap does not have to close.<h3>How often do gaps close?</h3><p>If you look back at daily and weekly charts over the past 100 years, you will see that every gap down eventually closed (the February gap will close at some point). And you would also find many gaps up that never closed and they never will close. If you just look at recent gaps up and down, about 70% will close within 3 years.<p>Gaps on the Emini chart have become less important in recent years because so many institutions use 24 hour charts. They don’t see the gaps on the day session chart.<p>Also, there are far fewer gaps on continuation charts because the market is open almost without stop from Sunday night through Friday night. When there are gaps, they are more likely to come on Mondays after the market has been closed for a couple days. News can happen during the closure and it can result in a gap up or down. That means that Monday gaps can have more significance. For example, February 24 was a Monday, and the gap down is present on both the daily and weekly charts.<h3>How low can a pullback go?</h3><p>It is important to note that the Emini dipped back below the February 24 high on Thursday. That is a sign of sellers in the gap. We do not know yet if the selling will be persistent and severe. We should find out within the next 2 weeks.<p>If it is, the 1st downside target is the bottom of the June trading range. A trading range is an area of agreement. Both the bulls and bears think the price is fair.<p>The Emini is now above what everyone thought was a fair price. If enough traders think it belongs back within that trading range, the Emini will probably test down to the bottom of that range, just below the 3000 big round number. At that point, traders will conclude that the July rally was just an extension of the June/July range instead of a resumption of the bull trend.<h3>Possible head and shoulder top within 2 months</h3><p>If there is a selloff to 3000 and then a bounce, traders will begin to talk about the possibility of a lower high and then a 2nd leg down. The trading range at that point would contain a lower high major trend reversal sell signal. Also, it would be a head and shoulders top.<p>If that top were to develop, there would be a 40% chance of a break below the June low and then a measured move down. That would take the Emini down to around the 2600.<p>That is just below the March 31 high, which was a breakout point. Pullbacks often test breakout points. This is especially true when the market is in a trading range. The Emini has been sideways for almost 3 years.<p>If the Emini were to fall that far, that would probably be the end of the pullback. There is only a 30% chance that a reversal down would go below the March low during the initial selloff.<p>Why 30% and not 10%? Because markets are always more balanced than you might think. The probability for everything that is reasonably possible hovers between 40 and 60%. Betting on a test of the bottom of the 3 year range is not crazy. Therefore the probability has to be at least 30%.<h3>Mystery chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-inverted-chart-in-spike-and-channel-bear-trend-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-25-7.png\" alt=\"Emini inverted chart in spike and channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p>The above chart had a huge bull trend that ended in March. It broke strongly to the downside in early April. After a pullback that formed a double top bear flag, it sold off in a wedge bear channel. The 3rd leg down also has 3 small legs so the selloff is a nested wedge. This has a higher probability of a reversal up.<p>Bear channels usually have bull breakouts. Therefore, traders should expect a rally soon.<p>When a Spike and Channel Bear Trend reverses up, it usually tests either or both lower highs. Here, those are the May and June highs. It then typically evolves into a trading range.<p>It is important to note that the strong bear trend so far is holding above the February bottom of the bull trend. While it retraced almost the entire rally, it still could be just a deep pullback in a bull trend.<p>So what market is this? It is the Emini, but I plotted it upside down. If you flip it over, you would see that the rally to the March high on this chart is the selloff to the March low on the Emini chart.<p>Sometimes its easier to see what might be going on if you can look at the market from a different perspective.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is a sign of a loss of momentum in the rally. Because it had a bear body, it is a sell signal bar for this week. But a doji is a weak sell signal bar<p>Friday was a bear day on the daily chart. It was the entry bar for the bears. who sold below Thursday’s low. Thursday was an outside down bar after a test into the February gap and therefore a sell signal bar.<p>Can the Emini still rally and close the February gap this week? There is still a 50% chance of a new high before there is a pullback to the middle of the 3 year range. However, the bulls need July to close at or above the June high and not at the low of the month. Traders will have a better idea by the end of the week, which is the end of the month.<h3>Final week of the month</h3><p>On the monthly chart, June had a big tail on top. I have been saying that there would probably be sellers above the June high. With July trading above June late in the month, I said there was an increased chance of a selloff at the end of July. That is still true.<p>This is the final week of the month and there is an increased probability of a reversal down. It might have started on Thursday. If there is a reversal down this week, it will probably lead to a selloff that will retrace about a third to a half of the 4 month rally. The swing down will probably last several weeks, but it could continue for a couple months.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. The bears want today to trade below last week’s low. That would trigger a weekly sell signal. The bulls, however, see Friday as a higher low major trend reversal on the 5 minute chart. They therefore want a strong rally and a resumption of the daily bull trend.<p>As I said, the next couple weeks are very important. The Emini is testing the all-time high after an extreme buy climax. There is therefore an increased chance of a big breakout or big reversal. That increases the chance of big trend days up or down.<p>However, the Emini often goes sideways while traders wait for the breakout to begin. Friday was an example. There is increased tension. Traders are ready for a big move. But they want to see consecutive big bars up or down. Until they see that, they will continue to look for reversals every 1 – 3 hours.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-27.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It does not matter if the rally will break above it on the current leg up. The rally is strong enough so that it should continue at least a little higher. It is likely to get above that high. However, because it is so extreme, there probably will be an abrupt pullback starting this week<h3>Nested wedge buy climax</h3><p>The rally has had 3 legs up from the March low. It is therefore a wedge buy climax. The overnight rally is an acceleration up from Thursday. Thursday was a pause after a 2 day strong rally.<p>When there are smaller days after bigger days in a buy climax, they are pauses between the legs. Today and Friday are forming the 3rd leg up in the past 7 days.<p>This is a parabolic wedge buy climax. Since it is within the bigger, 4 month wedge, there is now a nested wedge. It is also at a measured move up from the June wedge. This should attract profit taking this week. There is often a 1 or 2 day pullback and then a brief final leg up before the profit taking begins. But either way, the bulls will probably take some profits starting this week or next.<p>Once they do, there will probably be a 200 pip pullback lasting at least a week or two. However, the bears will need at least a couple weeks of sideways trading before they will have a reasonable chance at a trend reversal. Traders will be eager to buy a 200 pip pullback. There is now a bull trend on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market is way overdone. The overnight range is very big and it is coming late in a bull trend on the daily chart. This is probably a blow-off top. However, traders will continue to buy until there is a reversal down.<p>There was a trading range around 1.1720 overnight. A trading range late in a bull trend is an area of agreement. The EURUSD is now above that area of agreement and it is very overbought. Traders will probably conclude that the price is too high. Therefore, traders expect a pullback to 1.1720 today or tomorrow.<p>Also, this is coming just below the resistance of the September 2018 high and there is a buy climax on the daily chart. Traders know that there will be profit taking on the daily chart starting this week or next.<p>Normally, traders would not be looking to sell in a strong bull trend because the odds favor higher prices. A nested parabolic wedge buy climax is an exception. Consequently, despite the big overnight range, day traders will be willing to sell, looking for a pullback to the bottom of the most recent leg up on the 5 minute chart. This was the rally that began overnight from 1.17 today or tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-wedge-double-bottom-and-spike-and-channel-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double bottom and spike and channel bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But since Friday was a bear doji and Thursday was a big bear day, this was a weak buy signal.<p>The Emini rallied in a 10 bar bull micro channel on the open on the 5 minute chart. That was strong enough buying to make a bear trend day unlikely. After a parabolic wedge selloff to a double bottom, it rallied again to a small new high. This was a Spike and Channel Bull Trend Day and a Bull Trend Resumption day.<p>Today was mostly a trading range day, but it formed another higher low after Friday’s higher low major trend reversal. The 5 minute trend is weakly up.<p>I have been saying that traders want another test above the February 24 high and into the weekly chart. They will probably get it this week and maybe tomorrow.<p>Traders might want to see one more test above the February 24 high before looking for a reversal down into August.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Today and Friday are forming the 3rd leg up in the past 7 days.<p>This is a parabolic wedge buy climax. Since it is within the bigger, 4 month wedge, there is now a nested wedge. It is also at a measured move up from the June wedge. This should attract profit taking this week. There is often a 1 or 2 day pullback and then a brief final leg up before the profit taking begins. But either way, the bulls will probably take some profits starting this week or next.<p>Once they do, there will probably be a 200 pip pullback lasting at least a week or two. However, the bears will need at least a couple weeks of sideways trading before they will have a reasonable chance at a trend reversal. Traders will be eager to buy a 200 pip pullback. There is now a bull trend on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market is way overdone. The overnight range is very big and it is coming late in a bull trend on the daily chart. This is probably a blow-off top. However, traders will continue to buy until there is a reversal down.<p>There was a trading range around 1.1720 overnight. A trading range late in a bull trend is an area of agreement. The EURUSD is now above that area of agreement and it is very overbought. Traders will probably conclude that the price is too high. Therefore, traders expect a pullback to 1.1720 today or tomorrow.<p>Also, this is coming just below the resistance of the September 2018 high and there is a buy climax on the daily chart. Traders know that there will be profit taking on the daily chart starting this week or next.<p>Normally, traders would not be looking to sell in a strong bull trend because the odds favor higher prices. A nested parabolic wedge buy climax is an exception. Consequently, despite the big overnight range, day traders will be willing to sell, looking for a pullback to the bottom of the most recent leg up on the 5 minute chart. This was the rally that began overnight from 1.17 today or tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-wedge-double-bottom-and-spike-and-channel-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double bottom and spike and channel bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But since Friday was a bear doji and Thursday was a big bear day, this was a weak buy signal.<p>The Emini rallied in a 10 bar bull micro channel on the open on the 5 minute chart. That was strong enough buying to make a bear trend day unlikely. After a parabolic wedge selloff to a double bottom, it rallied again to a small new high. This was a Spike and Channel Bull Trend Day and a Bull Trend Resumption day.<p>Today was mostly a trading range day, but it formed another higher low after Friday’s higher low major trend reversal. The 5 minute trend is weakly up.<p>I have been saying that traders want another test above the February 24 high and into the weekly chart. They will probably get it this week and maybe tomorrow.<p>Traders might want to see one more test above the February 24 high before looking for a reversal down into August.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The buy triggered yesterday when yesterday traded above Friday’s high. The bulls want the Small Pullback Bull Trend on the daily chart to close the gap above the February 24 high and then to continue up to a new high.<p>However, the Emini reversed down from within the gap. The bears hope for a 2nd reversal down this week. That would be a higher probability reversal. They hope that the 4 month rally is just a bull leg in the 3 year trading range, and that it is only a test of resistance at the February gap and the all-time high.<p>Traders should find out this week or next. This is the final week of the month. If July closes on its high, traders will expect a new all-time high is August. But if it closes below the June high, especially far below, they will look for a 1 – 2 month pullback beginning this week or next.<p>Traders might use Wednesday’s FOMC announcement or Thursday’s GDP report as the excuse for the breakout to a new high or the reversal down to below 2800. The next couple of weeks might affect the next month or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 9 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was in a tight bull channel. A bull channel is the same as a bear flag because there is a bear breakout 75% of the time. Today will probably gap below the bull channel.<p>Many bears want to see the Emini test back into the February gap one more time. If it reverses down a 2nd time without closing the gap, the bears will be more confident that a 1 – 2 month reversal has begun.<p>The bulls also want the Emini to get back into the gap. But they then want it to continue up to a new high over the following couple weeks.<p>Yesterday’s high was within 5 points of the February 24 high at the bottom of the gap. The odds are that the Emini will enter the gap today or tomorrow.<p>This is a very important week. Will July close above the June high or far below? The Emini might go sideways into the FOMC and GDP announcements and then use one of them as an excuse for a breakout up or down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-wedge-double-bottom-and-spike-and-channel-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-28.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double bottom and spike and channel bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But there have been 3 surges, which means the rally is a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>Furthermore, it is within a bigger wedge bull channel from the March 23 low. This is a nested wedge buy climax at the resistance of the September 2018 high and a measured move target from the June 19 low. Traders will take profits soon.<p>The EURUSD might simply start to reverse down today, like it did after the March 27 buy climax. Or, there might be a 1 – 3 day pullback and then a brief rally to a double top, like in June.<p>However, this kind of climactic buying attracts sellers.

However, a top is likely and today’s close will give traders an indication of what type of top we will see.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had several selloffs and rallies overnight. The result is that it has been in a trading range for 8 hours. Day traders are now scalping for 20 pips up and down.<p>The bulls will continue to buy selloffs to get today’s close above the open. The bears will sell rallies and try to get today to close near its low. After several swings up and down overnight, today will probably remain a trading range day.

There is therefore an increased chance of a big move up or down starting within 2 weeks, and possibly today.<h3>The importance of the February gap</h3><p>Many bears do not want to sell until there is one more test into the weekly gap above the February 24 high and then a 2nd reversal down. Yesterday’s high was 2 points below that target. That might be all that the bears get. We will find out over the next week or two.<p>June was the 3rd consecutive bull bar on the monthly chart. But its small body and big tail are signs of a loss of momentum at the old high. Friday is the final trading day of the month. The June high therefore will be important at the end of the week.<h3>The July close is important</h3><p>If this month closes far above the June high, traders will expect higher prices in August. That means a new all-time high. If instead July closes far below the June high, traders will expect lower prices for a month or two. If July closes near the open of the month, August might be sideways for a 3rd consecutive month.<p>While the low of the month is about 120 points below yesterday’s close and there are only 3 days left, there is a 20% chance that the Emini will get there by Friday’s close. Do not be surprised if there is an extreme move up or down by the end of the week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex session. Yesterday ended with a sell climax. There is only a 25% chance of a strong bear trend day today, but there is a 50% chance of at least some follow-through selling in the 1st 2 hours. Also, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the end hour.<p>Because yesterday ended in a tight bear channel, the 1st reversal up today will probably be minor. The bulls typically will need some kind of test of yesterday’s low before they can get a bull trend reversal. The selling usually has to stop for an hour or two before relentless buying can begin.<p>Day traders should exit ahead of the 11 am PST FOMC announcement. Also, they should wait at least 10 minutes before resuming their day trades.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-High-2-bottom-and-weak-rally-but-late-selloff.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-29.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 bottom and weak rally but late selloff\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders expected at least a small 2nd leg up after the big bar on Monday. Yesterday was down and today tested yesterday’s high. Today therefore has met the minimum expectations of the bulls.<p>The bulls who bought Monday’s close were disappointed by yesterday being a bear day. Today tested Monday’s close allowing those bulls to exit without a loss.<p>We will find out over the next few days if the bulls are starting to exit. We will know if there is a big bear day today or tomorrow. If so, the EURUSD will likely pull back for a couple weeks.<p>It is currently equally likely that there will be one more 1 – 3 day rally to the September 2018 high before the pullback begins.<h3>ii Breakout Mode pattern</h3><p>Today’s high so far is below yesterday’s high and its low is above yesterday’s low. It is therefore so far an inside day. Yesterday was also an inside day.<p>Consecutive inside days form an ii (inside-inside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. When it comes late in a trend, it is both a bull flag and a micro double top.<p>If there is a bull breakout, the ii is typically the Final Bull Flag. Traders expect a reversal down within a few days.<p>At 11 am PST today, there is an FOMC announcement. It will affect all financial markets. Consequently, today will probably not remain an inside day.<p>Yesterday is a High 1 bull flag, but a bull breakout will probably reverse down, like in June. There is a micro double top so a selloff could begin a 2 week pullback.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from a rally to just below yesterday’s high. It sold off 50 pips, but so far is holding above yesterday’s low. It might remain an inside day until the FOMC announcement at 11 am PST. If so, day traders will scalp for 10 – 20 pips.<p>Because the FOMC announcement often leads to a big move up or down, traders view today as 2 different sessions. Today will probably be in a trading range until the report.<p>Once the report comes out, day traders should wait at least 10 minutes before trading. This is because there is usually at least one big reversal in the 1st 10 minutes.<p>They then have to be ready for anything.

I have been saying it probably would do that.<p>The bulls want a new all-time high, which would require a move into the gap. Yesterday was a big bull day.

If the bulls can get July to close near its high, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in August.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 27 points in the Globex session. Yesterday’s rally was in a bull channel. Since there is usually a break below the channel, traders should think of it as a bear flag. Today will probably open below the bull channel.<p>Channels typically evolve into trading ranges. Consequently, a trading range is likely today. But the legs will probably be big enough for swings up and down.<p>Can today be a big bear trend day? The June high is a magnet below with 2 days left to the month, so yes, today can trend down.<p>Can today rally strongly? Probably not. The bulls have already accomplished all that they need for July. The next magnet above the is the top of the February gap and that is likely too far above for this week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-rallied-in-bull-channel-on-FOMC-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-30.png\" alt=\"Emini rallied in bull channel on FOMC day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That was the start of the 2 year bear channel.<p>The rally from the March low has 3 legs. It is therefore a wedge bull channel and a buy climax. In addition, the rally of the past 3 weeks has 3 legs up in a tight bull channel. It is therefore a parabolic wedge buy climax. With 2 buy climax patterns at resistance, traders should expect some profit taking to begin within a week or so.<p>Yesterday’s high might be forming a micro double top with Monday’s high. This is in addition to the possible double top with the September 2018 high.<p>As strong as the rally has been over the past 3 weeks, this kind of price action is what traders typically see just before the bulls take profits. Traders should expect a 200 pip pullback to around the EMA to begin before the EURUSD breaks much above 1.18.<p>When a bull trend is as strong as this one has been, there will be many traders eager to buy a pullback. Therefore, a pullback is more likely than a reversal into a bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been going sideways for 4 days. The bulls hope that this is a pause in the bull trend and that the rally will soon break above the September 2018 high.<p>Every trading range has both buy and sell setups. The bears are hoping that yesterday’s high formed a double top with Monday’s high. If not, they hope that a move above Monday’s high will reverse down. There would then be a wedge top this week.<p>Because the EURUSD has been sideways for 4 days, day traders are looking for small swings lasting a few hours and for 10 – 20 pip scalps. After such a strong rally for several weeks, there will probably be a lot of back and forth trading over the next couple weeks. That means smaller swing trades and more scalping.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It began with a selloff to just above last week’s low and then it reversed up sharply. There was a small double bottom and therefore a High 2 2nd reversal up from below yesterday’s low. The buy signal bars were big and closed near their highs. This led to a huge rally to back into the February gap. The Emini went sideways for the 2nd half of the day around the bottom of the February gap, and rallied again to yesterday’s close in the final minutes.<p>Tomorrow is the last day of the week and off the month. Traders are deciding if the Emini will close above or below the June high. If it closes above, August will probably be at least a little higher.

I have been saying it probably would do that.<p>The bulls want a new all-time high, which would require a move into the gap. Yesterday was a big bull day. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices today.<p>Many bears want to see the Emini reverse down in the February gap for a 2nd time. That would increase the chance of a swing down on the daily chart. The are hoping that the 3 day rally is just a pullback from the selloff from the July high.<p>Traders should find out within a week if the Emini will make a new high or reverse down from a double top with the February high.<p>Friday is the final day of the month. If the bulls can get July to close near its high, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in August.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 27 points in the Globex session. Yesterday’s rally was in a bull channel. Since there is usually a break below the channel, traders should think of it as a bear flag. Today will probably open below the bull channel.<p>Channels typically evolve into trading ranges. Consequently, a trading range is likely today. But the legs will probably be big enough for swings up and down.<p>Can today be a big bear trend day? The June high is a magnet below with 2 days left to the month, so yes, today can trend down.<p>Can today rally strongly? Probably not. The bulls have already accomplished all that they need for July. The next magnet above the is the top of the February gap and that is likely too far above for this week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-rallied-in-bull-channel-on-FOMC-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-30.png\" alt=\"Emini rallied in bull channel on FOMC day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-micro-double-top-and-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-30-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex micro double top and parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied strongly up to the resistance of the September 2018 high. That was the start of the 2 year bear channel.<p>The rally from the March low has 3 legs. It is therefore a wedge bull channel and a buy climax. In addition, the rally of the past 3 weeks has 3 legs up in a tight bull channel. It is therefore a parabolic wedge buy climax. With 2 buy climax patterns at resistance, traders should expect some profit taking to begin within a week or so.<p>Yesterday’s high might be forming a micro double top with Monday’s high. This is in addition to the possible double top with the September 2018 high.<p>As strong as the rally has been over the past 3 weeks, this kind of price action is what traders typically see just before the bulls take profits. Traders should expect a 200 pip pullback to around the EMA to begin before the EURUSD breaks much above 1.18.<p>When a bull trend is as strong as this one has been, there will be many traders eager to buy a pullback. Therefore, a pullback is more likely than a reversal into a bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been going sideways for 4 days. The bulls hope that this is a pause in the bull trend and that the rally will soon break above the September 2018 high.<p>Every trading range has both buy and sell setups. The bears are hoping that yesterday’s high formed a double top with Monday’s high. If not, they hope that a move above Monday’s high will reverse down. There would then be a wedge top this week.<p>Because the EURUSD has been sideways for 4 days, day traders are looking for small swings lasting a few hours and for 10 – 20 pip scalps. After such a strong rally for several weeks, there will probably be a lot of back and forth trading over the next couple weeks. That means smaller swing trades and more scalping.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It began with a selloff to just above last week’s low and then it reversed up sharply. There was a small double bottom and therefore a High 2 2nd reversal up from below yesterday’s low. The buy signal bars were big and closed near their highs. This led to a huge rally to back into the February gap. The Emini went sideways for the 2nd half of the day around the bottom of the February gap, and rallied again to yesterday’s close in the final minutes.<p>Tomorrow is the last day of the week and off the month. Traders are deciding if the Emini will close above or below the June high. If it closes above, August will probably be at least a little higher. If it closes below, July will still have a big bull body, but it will not be as strong.<p>The February gap and the June high will be magnets tomorrow, especially in the final hour. Tomorrow’s close can affect what the Emini will do in August.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Because it was a bull bar and the Emini is in a bull trend on the daily chart, tomorrow is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>However, the Emini has been sideways for 2 weeks. Traders are still deciding if the 4 month rally will continue up to a new high or if the Emini will first pull back to the middle of the 3 year trading range.<p>Today is the final day of the week and of the month. The bulls want July to close above the June high and in the February gap. Both will be magnets in the final hour today.<p>Will today be a big trend day? Most days have a lot of trading range price action. Furthermore, the Emini is near 2 important magnets. Also, the Emini is in the middle of a 2 week trading range. These factors reduce the chance of a big trend day today. The Emini will probably stay within 20 points of either the June high or the February gap, and then test one of the magnets in the final hour.<p>However, yesterday was particularly strong. The Emini could easily continue up to a new July high and close the month on the high. That would be a close far above the June high and make higher prices likely in August.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex session. While the bears want the month to close below the June high, that is about 40 points lower. Furthermore, it is below the support of the EMA on 60 minute chart. Consequently, July will probably close above the June high.<p>For day traders, while yesterday was strong, it was also sideways for 4 hours. That trading range is a magnet. Also, the bulls are confident that they will accomplish their goal of having July close above June. And, they are exhausted from yesterday’s big reversal up. These factors reduce the chance of a big bull day.<p>So traders are not expecting a big rally or a big selloff. That means today will probably spend a lot of time going sideways. But even if that is true, the legs up and down should be big enough for day traders to swing trade.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-31.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

On the daily chart above, the rally is extreme. There was a parabolic wedge last week, but this week broke above the wedge.<p>However, the bear bar on Tuesday might be a 1 day Final Bull Flag. There is also a potential higher high double top with the September 2018 high. Also, this is the 3rd leg up from the March low so there is a big wedge bull channel.<p>Because the rally is extreme and climactic, the bulls should take profits soon for a couple weeks. That should result in a couple legs small sideways to down for about 200 pips to near the EMA. The minor reversal down might even test the March high.<p>It is important to note that traders now see the daily and weekly charts as in bull trends. They will buy the pullback. The selloff should become a bull flag and not a bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to another 52 week high last night but reversed all of the way back down to the open and to yesterday’s close. Today so far is a reversal day. That is a sign that the bulls are beginning to take profits and the bears are starting to sell.<p>Yesterday reversed Wednesday’s rally, but traders bought the reversal and yesterday closed on its high. Will they do that again today? It is more likely that the bulls will not buy aggressively now that there is a 2nd reversal attempt in a market that is likely on the verge of pulling back. Day traders today looking to buy will be scalping.<p>Will the bears continue the overnight bear trend? There is no need. As long as today closes around the open, today will be a reversal bar on the daily chart. Since traders expect a profit taking pullback to begin within the next few days, this is all that the bears need. They would like today to close below the open, but they do not need a big bear day. Besides, the bulls probably will not allow it.<p>Traders believe that today isn’t going up or down much. It will therefore probably be a trading range. It could be the start of a 2 week profit taking pullback.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-7-31-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.
