Even if there is a reversal, it will probably lead to 1- to 2-month trading range, and not bear trend.<li>Today is the 1<sup>st</sup>day of June. The bulls want a gap up on the monthly chart, but that will probably not happen.<li>May had a small bear body, and it was therefore a bear doji bar in a strong bull trend. Because it was a bear bar, even though only a doji, it was the 3<sup>rd</sup>pause in the yearlong tight bull channel. It is therefore a weak sell signal bar for a parabolic wedge reversal.<li>Bulls often take profits once there is a parabolic wedge. Increased chance that the rally will stall here or slightly above. For example, if June breaks to a new high but forms a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar, it would be a 2<sup>nd</sup>sell signal bar for the parabolic wedge.<li>On daily chart, Friday was sell signal bar for wedge rally to a lower high double top major trend reversal.<li>However, Friday was small and today is going to gap above Friday’s high.<li>Wedge rally started with May 14 high. If today breaks above May 28 top of wedge but then reverses again, there would be a new wedge that began on May 25. The bears will still try to get a reversal down from wedge rally to double top with May 7 high.<li>Strong trends resist reversing. I have been saying for many months that the rally has been climactic, but that buy climaxes are more likely to continue than reverse. Traders will continue to bet on higher prices, knowing that a 10% correction can come at any time.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Up 21 points in Globex session.<li>Today will gap above Friday’s high.<li>Today will open above Friday’s high, which was the top of a wedge.<li>Breakout above a wedge has 50% chance of continuing up, and 50% chance of reversing down a 2nd time, usually from another wedge.<li>Near top of 2-month trading range and bears want reversal down. With today reversing the 2-day selloff, big bear day is unlikely.<li>Bulls want strong breakout to new all-time high, which is top of 2-month trading range.<li>Today will probably not break above the May 7 all-time high. Therefore, the bulls are not quite as strong as they could be.<li>However, trading range is Breakout Mode, and bulls are reversing last week’s attempt at top. Today will probably be either sideways or up.<li>Sideways for 6 days, which increases the chance of a lot of trading range trading again today.<li>But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in 1<sup>st</sup>hour, traders will look for trend day.<li>Most likely, today will be either sideways to up.</ul><h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-rally-to-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex wedge rally to double top.

This is a small pattern and therefore more likely a minor reversal than a major trend reversal.<li>Minor reversal usually results in more sideways days.<li>Bears want today to be big bear bar closing near its low. Today would then be a higher probability sell signal bar for tomorrow.<li>Strong 2-month rally and most reversals fail so good for bulls. Bulls would like big bull day, but would be happy with anything other than big bear day. If they can stop a reversal, they will expect another attempt to break above Feb 25 high.<li>Small day so far, so traders think price is just about right.

More likely, it is not (see below).</ul><h4 id=\"3-11-month-trading-range\">11-month trading range</h4><ul><li>Higher low double bottom (November 2020 and March 2021) and lower high double top (January and May, 2021).<li>Bears want strong break below March low, which is neckline of January 2021/May 2021 double top.<li>They then want measured move down from below the November 2020 low (bottom of 10-month range) to bottom of 7-year trading range<li>Bears also want 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down from last year’s wedge top.<li>Bulls want any selloff in June or July to be a pullback from the April/May strong rally.<li>Bulls want the the November 2020/March 2021 double bottom to lead to a break above the February 2018 top of the trading range.<li>The April/May rally was strong enough, so that the June selloff is more likely a pullback from that rally, than the start of a bear trend.<li>Therefore, a selloff in June and July will probably stay above the March low, and the 10-month trading will have evolved into a triangle.</ul><h4 id=\"4-7-year-trading-range\">7-year trading range</h4><ul><li>Higher low double bottom (January 2017 and March 2020), and a lower high double top (February 2018 and January 2021).<li>If there is a big reversal down from here, it will probably not break below the 2017 bottom of the 7-year range, because last year’s rally was strong, and it came from a higher low.<li>Furthermore, any selloff will probably turn up from above the March 2020 higher low.<li>Therefore, if there is a big selloff from here, the trading range will more likely evolve into a triangle.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-5-1.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart in parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>Strong rally from last year’s pandemic low, but rally has had 3 pushes up. It is therefore a parabolic wedge, which often attracts profit takers.<li>Buy climaxes can last much longer than what seems reasonable.<li>Parabolic wedge does not guarantee profit taking. The Small Pullback Bull Trend could continue for many more months, without a 2- to 3-month pullback, but that is unlikely.<li>So far, June is a small bear inside bar.<li>If it remains a bear bar, many traders will see that as a sign of profit taking in a parabolic wedge buy climax. That would increase the chance of lower prices for at least a couple months.<li>Bulls want June to be a 5<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar. That would be unusual this late in a buy climax.<li>Therefore, June will probably close below the open of the month, even if June goes above the May high before the end of the month.<li>Because the bull trend is so strong, if the Emini sells off for a few months, the reversal will probably be minor.<li>A minor reversal only has a 30% chance of growing into a bear trend (major reversal) without first transitioning into at least a small trading range.<li>While the 1<sup>st</sup>pullback will probably be only a few months, it is important to note that it could lead to a trading range that could last a year or more. The January 2018 buy climax led to a trading range that lasted 2 years. The trading range that began in 2014 lasted more than a year, despite a very strong bull trend.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-tight-trading-range-with-micro-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart tight trading range with micro double top\"></a></figure><ul><li>Outside down week that reversed up, and ended as outside up week.<li>Closed above last week’s high, but not above May 7 all-time high.<li>Since closed just below all-time high, might gap up to new high next week.<li>Bears want reversal down from small double top with May 7 high. Since strong bull trend, minor reversal is more likely than bear trend. A minor reversal is usually only a few weeks, like all of the other minor reversals since the March 2020 low.<li>Small Pullback Bull Trend since March 2020.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend typically evolves into a trading range once it has lasted 60 bars or so. Therefore, a trading range is likely soon.<li>Weekly chart has been in a trading range for 8 weeks, but that is probably not enough to end the Small Pullback Bull Trend. Odds continue to favor higher prices.<li>When a strong trend ends, it usually will have a correction that is deeper, and lasts longer than all of the prior corrections in the trend.<li>This trend had a 10% correction that lasted 2 months (last September and October).<li>Once there is a correction, it should be more than 10%, and last more than 2 months.<li>If there is more than a 10% correction, traders begin to look for a 20% correction. This is because Institutions say that a correction has converted into a bear trend once it reaches 20%. Traders see it as a psychological support level, and therefore a magnet.<li>Any reversal can be major (become a bear trend). The 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down in a Small Pullback Bull Trend only has 30% chance of growing into a bear trend without first evolving into a trading range.<li>Therefore, even if there is a 20% correction that lasts several months, traders will expect a test of the high, before there would be a 40% chance of a bear trend.<li>Until there is a clear, strong reversal down, the odds are that every selloff will just be another small pullback that will lead to a new high.<li>A correction (10% or more) is typically not clearly underway until it is about half over.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-high-1-bull-flag-but-possible-double-top-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-5-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart high 1 bull flag but possible double top in 2-month trading range.\"></a></figure><ul><li>Friday triggered High 1 bull flag buy signal.<li>Friday closed near its high, so might gap up to new all-time high next week.<li>Even though trading range for 2 months, traders continue to expect higher prices. There is currently 60% chance of bull breakout, and 40% chance of bear breakout.<li>Bears want reversal down from around May all-time high. Emini has stalled just above 4,200 for 2 months. It is therefore important resistance in an overbought market.<li>If there is new high next week, and then a reversal down, there will be a wedge rally to a higher high double top. The 1<sup>st</sup>2 legs of the wedge are the May 14 and June 1 highs.<li>Wedge rally to a double top is a common topping pattern.<li>Stock market tends to rally around June 26 through the 6<sup>th</sup>of July. That means it tends to not rally in mid-June, which increases the chance of sideways to down for a couple weeks.<li>Most tops fail. Traders will continue to buy every reversal down until one is exceptionally strong. They will then conclude that the market is correcting.<li>A correction is usually half over by the time traders decide it is underway.<li>Once traders believe the market is in a correction, they like to wait for a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down before buying again. That process could take several weeks and possible a few months.

There would then be a gap up on the weekly chart as well.<li>If there is a gap up, it will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<li>Since the Emini is at the top of a 2-month trading range, it is in Breakout Mode. It is now testing the top of the range, and there is therefore an increased chance of a strong trend day up or down.<li>Friday was a buy climax day, and so there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading, that starts by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>If today is going to be a trend day, there will probably be a series of strong trend bars in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour.<li>If today is a bull trend day, and it breaks above the May high, there is an increased chance of a midday reversal down, since breakouts in general fail half the time.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-weak-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-7.png\" alt=\"Emini weak small pullback bull trend.

It is an important magnet, and only 21 points above today’s high.<li>Bulls want strong breakout above 9-week tight trading range, and then a 200-point measured move up, based on the height of the range.<li>Bulls need a couple bull bars closing near their highs, before traders will conclude that the breakout is successful.<li>Yesterday made a new all-time high on the open, but then reversed down to below Monday’s low. It was therefore an outside down day.<li>Traders bought below Monday’s low, and the Emini reversed back up to above yesterday’s high, becoming an outside up day.<li>Yesterday tested into gap below June 4 low, but did not close the gap.<li>There have been several breakouts, above and below the trading range since it began in April.<li>Each one reversed and led to a breakout in the opposite direction. This is therefore an expanding triangle.<li>Since that is just a type of trading range, it does not change anything. The chart is still in Breakout Mode.<li>Yesterday was another breakout above the range, but the bulls need follow-through buying today, or tomorrow for the breakout to be successful.<li>The bears need a bear bar and a reversal down within the next few days, for traders to conclude that the breakout has failed.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Up 7 points in Globex session. Might gap above yesterday’s high. If so, gap will probably be small, and small gaps typically close in 1<sup>st</sup>hour or so.<li>Most days over past few weeks have had at least one swing up and one swing down, so traders will look for at least one reversal today.<li>Since testing top of trading range, there should be either strong breakout, or strong reversal down at some point, which means one or more strong trend days in either direction.<li>If series of strong trend bars in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour, day traders will expect trend day. If not, they will look for reversals, like they have been doing for a couple weeks.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-outside-down-and-then-outside-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-9.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is an increased chance of sellers above.<li>Trading range is Breakout Mode, which means that the probability of a successful bull breakout, is about the same as a successful bear breakout.<li>Strong bull trend since March 31, so odds slightly higher for bull breakout.<li>Friday reversed up from a 3-week wedge bull flag.<li>Traders see yesterday as a pullback from Friday’s and Monday’s rally, which was the 1<sup>st</sup>leg up. Bulls hope that today is start of 1- to 3-day 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up.<li>Bears want double top with June 1 high, which would be double top lower high major trend reversal.<li>There is no sense that the price is terribly wrong and therefore no emotion to create a sustained move in either direction.<li>All trading ranges eventually break into trends, but until they do, traders will continue to look for reversals every few days.</ul><h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Today broke above yesterday’s high, which triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal in the rally that began June 4.<li>Breakout stalled at 3 pips above yesterday’s high, and therefore the breakout has been weak.

This is neutral. Traders need more information before concluding that the breakout above the 2-month trading range will succeed or fail.<li>Emini weak breakout above May high. Bulls need strong follow-through buying soon, if this is going to be the start of a 200-point measured move up.<li>Yesterday closed above May 7 breakout point. If bulls can form a bull bar today, that also closes above that high, there would be consecutive bull bars closing above a breakout point. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<li>If they fail to get follow-through buying soon, they will sell out of their longs. Also, bears will suspect the breakout is failing and they will sell more aggressively.<li>Today is Friday, so weekly support and resistance can be important.<li>Bulls want the week to close above the open of the week. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<li>Open of week is only about 10 points below yesterday’s close, and it therefore might get tested today.<li>Bulls want week closes above yesterday’s high, at a new all-time high.<li>Bears want the week to close below the open, so that it would have a bear body. That would increase the chance of sideways to down trading next week.<li>Market often pulls back in the middle of June, ahead of the June 26 through July 5 bullish seasonal tendency. It is the end of the quarter, and many institutions buy the best stocks of the quarter so that their portfolios look better in the quarterly reports (end of the quarter window dressing).<li>There might be some euphoria just before a holiday, and the start of the summer.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Up 9 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Most important magnets today are the open of the week (about 10 points below yesterday’s close), the May 7 high (about 6 points below yesterday’s close), and yesterday’s high (all-time high).<li>Yesterday was in trading range for final 4 hours, and today will probably open in that range. That would increase the chance of a trading range open.<li>Bulls want trend resumption up after yesterday’s strong bull trend reversal.<li>Bears hope the rally will form a lower high, and reverse down.<li>Most days over past several weeks have had at least one swing up, and one swing down, so that is likely again today.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour, there would be an increased chance of a strong trend day. Most days have at least one reversal.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-then-V-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-11.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax and then V bottom.

Therefore, possible bear channel.<li>Middle of 2-month trading range, so Breakout Mode, and traders looking for reversals every few days.<li>Bulls want double bottom with June 4, May 13, or May 5 lows.<li>Today is Friday, so weekly support and resistance can be important.<li>This week so far is a bear inside bar, and it follows a double top 2 weeks ago with the February 25 high.<li>If this week closes below its midpoint, and especially near its low, it will be a good sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<li>Bears want week to break below last week’s low (June 4 low), and close below that low.<li>Bulls want week to close above the open, but that is unlikely, given the strong trend down overnight on the 5 minute chart.<li>The more the week closes near its low, the more likely next week will be lower, which means more likely the selloff will test the 1.20 area.<li>If today can reverse up, and close in the middle of today’s range, traders will expect more sideways trading next week.<li>At the moment, it looks like the EURUSD will trade at least a little lower next week.</ul><h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Strong overnight bear trend. Day traders have only been selling, and many have been swing trading.<li>The daily range is about average, which means the trend will probably not continue much lower.<li>There was an unusually big bear bar in the last hour. That might be an exhaustive sell climax.<li>The bulls want the strong bear trend to convert into a trading range. It is unlikely that the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up will become a bull trend. The strong bear trend will probably have to transition into a trading range, before the bulls can get a strong reversal up.<li>Day traders will only sell until there is at least a 20- to 30-pip rally. At that point, they will expect a trading range, and then they will begin to buy reversals up from the low for scalps.<li>Unless there is an extremely strong reversal up (50 or more pips), it will probably be easier to make money selling all day.<li>Once the bear trend converts into a trading range, the bears will switch to scalping from swing trading.<li>Bulls want today to close above yesterday’s low. That is only 31 pips above the current low, and therefore possible.<li>Today will probably close around yesterday’s low or below, and therefore near the low of the week.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That means there is about a 50% chance of a bull or bear breakout, and a measured move up or down.<li>As uniformly bullish as all of the TV experts are, there is no breakout until there is a clear breakout.<li>Markets have inertia and resist change.

The bulls need bigger bars or several more small bars, to convince traders that the trading range is ending, and the yearlong bull trend is resuming.<li>The bigger the bull bars, and the more they close on their highs, the more likely the rally will reach a 200-point measured move above the May 7 high.<li>Friday was a bull inside bar in a bull trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<li>The odds favor at least slightly higher prices, but unless there is a Bull Surprise breakout, the rally will probably not reach a 200-point measured move target.<li>The rally is in a wedge bull channel. A reversal down would be from a wedge rally to a higher high double top with the May 7 high.<li>That is a common reversal pattern, but the wedge is not clear, and there is no sell signal bar. The odds are against a major reversal without a good sell signal bar, or a big Bear Surprise Bar.<li>A reversal would also be a higher high major trend reversal, and an expanding triangle top, which began with the April 16 or April 29 highs.<li>Even a strong sell setup (this one is weak) in a bull trend, only has a 40% chance of leading to a trend reversal (into bear trend).<li>Most of the time, a selloff from a top will be only a minor reversal. That means that it will be a pullback in the bull trend (bull flag), or lead to a trading range, just like every other reversal since March 2020.<li>Until there is a strong reversal down, traders will continue to expect higher prices. They will bet that every reversal down will fail within a few bars.<li>Once a correction is clearly underway, it is usually about half over.<li>Traders will continue to expect higher prices until there is a strong reversal down.</ul><h2 id=\"6-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

June FOMC report at 11am PT today.<li>Tight bull channel on daily chart for 4 weeks, so traders continue to expect higher prices. They will continue to buy 1- to 3-day selloffs until there is a very strong reversal down.<li>Yesterday’s high was below Monday’s all-time high, and yesterday’s low was above Monday’s low, so yesterday was an inside day. Both buy and sell signal bar.<li>Sell signal bar for failed breakout above May 7 high, but tight bull channel for 4 weeks. Minor sell setup.<li>High 1 buy signal bar but bear body.

Since more signs of inflation, more potential for a change in the Fed’s wording.<li>This increases the chance of a big move after the report. It could be in either direction, and it also could reverse and form an opposite big move.<li>Because of potential for big move after any 11 am PT FOMC report, day traders should exit positions ahead of report.<li>Since there is usually a big move in both directions in 1<sup>st</sup>few minutes after report, day traders should wait at least 10 minutes after the report before resuming trading.<li>Very little correlation between the moves before and after the report. Trade what happens after the report as if it is the start of a new day.<li>Ahead of the report, be open to anything. Yesterday had a lot of trading range trading, as do most days. Day traders will expect reversals.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars, day traders will look for a trend, but they should exit ahead of report.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-bear-trend-from-open-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-16.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from open then trading range.

It was caused by disappointed bulls exiting their longs in a panic (a Give-up bar). It was also a Bear Surprise Bar.<li>Surprise Bar means low probability. While it was likely that the EURUSD would turn down at some point, it was unlikely that any particular week would turn down and form a big bear bar.<li>A low probability bearish event traps bulls in and bears out.<li>Some bulls did not exit, and are now hoping for a bounce, so that they can sell out with a smaller loss.<li>Some bears did not short, and they want a bounce that will allow them to short with less risk.<li>With both bulls and bears looking to sell the 1<sup>st</sup>rally, the odds are there will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.</ul><h4 id=\"3-bear-trap-or-a-selloff-to-the-november-low\">Bear Trap or a selloff to the November low?</h4><ul><li>Can the bear breakout be a bear trap (a failed breakout that reverses up)? Any breakout can be a trap. Unless next week is a bull bar closing near its high, there will be a 60% chance of at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down over the next few weeks.<li>If next week is a big bear bar closing on its low, the odds of a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down will be about 70%.<li>How far down can the selloff go? The obvious 1<sup>st</sup>target is the bottom of the 11-month range. That is either the November 4, or March 31 lows, around 1.16 and 1.17.<li>The bulls want a higher low, so that the EURUSD would still be in a bull channel. The March low is above the November low.<li>The bears want a strong break below both of those lows. They would then want a measured move down to the bottom of the 7-year trading range, which is last year’s low at around 1.03.<li>What is most likely? I keep saying that trading ranges resist breaking out. Therefore, if the EURUSD reaches the bottom of the 11-month range, which is likely, it would then probably go sideways to up for several weeks. Traders would need time to decide if it will break below, or go back up to the middle or top of the range.</ul><h2 id=\"4-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"5-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-with-double-top-at-measured-move-target.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-19-1.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart with double top at measured move target. Wedge rally to double top.\"></a></figure><ul><li>I have been talking for months about the measured move target based on the June 5 high, and then the September 25/October 30 double bottom test of that high. The Emini has stalled at the target for a couple months.<li>This week broke above it and reversed down. It is to early to know if the reversal will be a pause, that will lead to another attempt to break above this resistance. Or, if the resistance will hold and the bulls will take profits, leading to a correction.<li>This week traded above last week’s high, and made a new all-time high. It then sold off to below last week’s low. This week is therefore an outside down week, which is bearish.<li>This week closed below last week’s low. That increases the chance of lower prices next week.<li>Because it closed near its low, next week could gap down on the weekly chart. If the gap stayed open, it would further increase the chance of lower prices.<li>The bears see this week as a sell signal bar for a double top with the May 7 high.<li>The bar after an outside bar frequently has a lot of overlap with the outside bar. It often is an inside bar. Therefore, the outside bar might not be as bearish as some might think. The bears need sustained selling to convince traders that a reversal is underway.<li>I keep making the point that the weekly chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for over a year. That is a type of strong bull trend. Most reversal attempts in a strong trend fail, and become bull flags.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend usually gets a big pullback after about 60 bars. Therefore, that is likely within the next couple months. The Emini would then no longer be in a Small Pullback Bull Trend.<li>A strong bull trend only has a 30% chance of immediately reversing into a bear trend, without first evolving into a trading range. Therefore, the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down might be big enough to end the strong trend, and possibly lead to a swing down, but it should not continue down into a bear trend.</ul><h4 id=\"6-how-low-can-this-go\">How low can this go?</h4><ul><li>How big a pullback is needed to end a Small Pullback Bull Trend?<li>Traders should expect a pullback that is bigger, and lasts longer than any prior pullback in the trend.<li>The biggest pullback was 10% in September and October. Therefore, traders should expect a 15-20% pullback to begin within the next couple months.<li>Once a pullback reaches 10%, it has a 50% chance of eventually falling 20%.<li>Traders will buy the selloff, because they know that even a strong reversal down in a strong bull trend, will likely reverse back up and test the high.<li>Is this week the start of a 20% pullback? While a 15-20% pullback is likely at some point this year, picking the exact start is a losing bet. It is always more likely that every reversal down will be brief, and the bull trend will resume. Therefore, this selloff will probably not be the end of the strong bull trend.<li>For traders to conclude that the strong bull trend is over, they need to see strong, sustained selling. By the time that happens, the correction is usually already half over.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-trend-reversal-down-from-wedge-rally-to-higher-high-double-top-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart trend reversal down from wedge rally to higher high double top major trend reversal\"></a></figure><ul><li>I have been saying for many months that Fed Chairman Powell was wrong to say that the Fed would not raise rates until at least 2023. There are far too many variables beyond his control to make that statement, and making it hurt his credibility.<li>The recent CPI reading of 5% was too much to ignore. To restore some credibility, he was forced to change his statement this week. That resulted in Wednesday’s selloff after the FOMC announcement.<li>I still think what he is saying is wrong, and that he will be forced to raise rates next year.<li>Is he lying, or just trying to reassure the markets? To me, it’s a lie because he should know better. But it does not matter. If enough institutions think inflation will rise faster than what Powell continues to say, that will reduce the upside for the markets over the next couple years.<li>Why did the market not continue to sell off on Wednesday, after a change in Powell’s position? Traders already knew that Powell had to change his statement, and that was already factored in.<li>There was a reflexive selloff when he made the announcement, but no follow-through selling until Friday. The bears quickly bought back their shorts on Wednesday, and the bulls bought the brief discount.<li>It is important to note that bear trends often have strong rallies, like after the FOMC announcement on Wednesday, and again on Thursday. They are bull traps, tricking eager bulls into buying in a bear trend, hoping that the old bull trend is intact.<li>Those eager bulls get overwhelmed by bears who are waiting for strong rallies to sell, confident that the market will go lower in a series of lower highs and lows.</ul><h4 id=\"8-wedge-rally-to-higher-high-double-top-but-strong-bull-trend\">Wedge rally to higher high double top, but strong bull trend</h4><ul><li>Tuesday made a new all-time high but reversed down.<li>The rally from the May 12 low is a wedge bull channel, which often attracts profit-takers. The shape is not good, and it therefore might not have attracted as many sellers initially as a more typical wedge would. However, if the bears get persistent selling over the next couple weeks, traders will conclude that a correction is underway.<li>The reversal is also a higher high double top with the May 7 high. It is therefore a higher high major trend reversal.<li>A major trend reversal with a reasonable sell signal bar, like on Tuesday, has a 40% chance of leading to a swing down.</ul><h4 id=\"9-what-is-the-difference-between-a-swing-down-and-a-bear-trend\">What is the difference between a swing down and a bear trend?</h4><ul><li>Note that I did not say a 40% chance of a bear trend. I said a swing down. A swing means at least 2 legs sideways to down, and about 10 or more bars.<li>The stronger the selloff, the higher the probability that a swing down will grow into a bear trend, which is a series of lower highs and lows.<li>If the bears get a couple big bear bars closing near their lows or 3 – 5 bear bars mostly closing below their midpoints, the probability of a bear trend would be 40%.<li>At the moment, traders expect at least a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>There is only a 40% chance that it be a swing down, and not just sideways.<li>The probability that this is the start of a bear trend is currently only 30%.</ul><h4 id=\"10-what-is-the-difference-between-a-bear-trend-and-a-bear-market\">What is the difference between a bear trend and a bear market?</h4><ul><li>The definition of a bear trend is based on a chart. It is a series of lower highs and lows.<li>Institutions and the media talk about bear<em>markets</em>and not bear<em>trends</em>.<li>A bear market is a 20% drop from the high, which can happen without a bear trend (a series of lower highs and lows on a chart).<li>For example, a single bear bar in a strong bull trend on the monthly chart, can have a low that is 20% down from the high. The media would call it a bear market, even though it was only a one-bar pullback in a bull trend.</ul><h4 id=\"11-what-about-next-week\">What about next week?</h4><ul><li>There is a seasonal tendency to go sideways to down in the middle of June, and then up from June 26 to July 5. The math is not good enough to use this to trade, but traders should be prepared for a rally at the end of the month, which is also the end of the quarter.<li>Wednesday’s FOMC announcement created a big bear bar on the daily chart.<li>Thursday had a small bull body, and it was therefore a weak follow-through bar for the bears.<li>However, the bears got strong follow-through selling on Friday. It gapped down and closed on the low, and below the 50-day MA and the June 3 low.<li>Also, this week’s low was exactly at a 50% retracement of the May 19 to June 14 rally<li>Another support level is the bull trend line from the October 30 low — a magnet just below Friday’s low.<li>Because the Emini is at a cluster of support, the bulls will try to stop the selling next week. They then would try to rally back up to a new high, after that seasonally bullish window begins on June 26 (next Saturday).<li>Traders will find out over the next couple weeks, if this selloff is the start of a swing down or bear trend. It currently is more likely that will be just another pullback in the yearlong bull trend.<li>However, the selloff has been strong enough, so that traders will sell the 1<sup>st</sup>bounce, expecting at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>If the Emini continues down strongly early next week, the odds will shift in favor of a test of the May low, and the 4,000 Big Round Number.</ul><h2 id=\"12-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

A bull day after a big bear day where there is very little overlap between the 2 days is bullish.<li>Many of Friday’s sellers did not exit today. If they exit this week, their short covering could lead to a new high.<li>Yesterday’s low was another test of the 50-day MA and the May 14 high. That high was the neckline for the May 12/May 19 double bottom.<li>There are 6 trading days left in June. The bulls want the Emini to close above the open of the month so that June will have a bull body on the monthly chart.<li>If June has a bear body, it will be a sell signal bar for a parabolic wedge buy climax on the monthly chart.<li>I have mentioned several times that the stock market tends to rally going into the 4<sup>th</sup>of July. The most reliable start of the rally is June 26. It is possible that the late June rally began today. If the bulls get follow-through buying, then the Emini will probably make a new high within the next 2 weeks.<li>Can today be a bull trap? Any rally can be a bull trap. If the Emini sells off strongly this week, there would be a head and shoulders top on the daily chart, where the May 7 high would be the left shoulder.<li>It is important to note that any top has only a 40% chance of leading to a bear trend. Therefore, it is more likely that any reversal down this week will simply be a bear leg in the 3-month trading range.<li>Because the Emini has been in a trading range, traders expect reversals.<li>The bears wanted Friday to lead to a bear breakout. The bulls want today to lead to a bull breakout and for last week’s selloff to be a late June bear trap.<li>But until there is a breakout, traders will continue to expect disappointing follow-through after strong moves up and down and then another reversal.<li>The strong 16-month rally and yesterday’s strong reversal up make a successful bull breakout slightly more likely than a bear breakout. If the bulls get a good 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive strong bull day tomorrow, there will probably be a new high soon.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 2 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day. Today therefore has at least a 75% chance of going sideways to down for at least a couple hours, starting by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour. It might get stuck in the trading range that set up after the first 90 minutes yesterday.<li>Even if today is mostly sideways, it should have at least one swing up and one swing down.<li>There is only a 25% chance that today will be a 2nd consecutive big bull day or big bear day.<li>While more trading range trading is likely, if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction in the 1st hour, there will be an increased chance of a strong trend day.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend-From-The-Open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-22.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bull Trend From The Open - rallying from bear trap in late June.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Instead, it was a big bull day.<li>Yesterday’s high was below Friday’s high and its low was above Friday’s low. Yesterday was therefore a bull inside bar.<li>That is a Breakout Mode setup. It is both a buy and sell signal bar for today.<li>Since it was a bull bar in a sell climax, it is a weak Low 1 sell signal bar. There will probably be buyers not far below its low.<li>For the bulls, they want the 3-day selloff to be a bear trap and a failed breakout below the May 5 bottom of a 2-month trading range.<li>So far, today is inside of yesterday’s range. If it remains an inside day, there will be consecutive inside bars (ii), which is a more reliable Breakout Mode Pattern.<li>An ii late in a bear trend usually either leads to a reversal up or it becomes a Final Bear Flag. That means if there is a bear breakout, it typically fails and the EURUSD reverses up within a few days.<li>Since the 3 bear bars were surprisingly big, the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up will probably be minor, even if it gets back above the bottom of the range at the May 5 low.<li>Since the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 11 months, traders should expect disappointment. Consequently, the rally might go above the May 5 low without 1<sup>st</sup>forming a micro double bottom. This would disappoint the bears who want a bear trend.<li>Whether or not it does, the bulls will probably need at least a small double bottom before they can get much above the June 16 sell climax high. The start of a sell climax is always a magnet when there is a reversal up.<li>The EURUSD will probably be sideways to up for at least a couple days and possibly for a couple weeks.<li>Last week’s selloff was so strong that traders expect at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down before there is a rally above the May high.<li>There is a 30% chance that this will be a V-bottom and that the EURUSD will go straight up to above the June 16 high in June.</ul><h3>EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Today reversed down from below yesterday’s high. So far, it is above yesterday’s low. It is therefore a 2nd consecutive inside day.<li>Today will probably not break far above or below yesterday’s range so today will likely not be a trend day.<li>Day traders so far today have been scalping in both directions<li>If it remains a 2nd inside day, the bulls will try to get it to close near the high. That would increase the chance of a rally over the next few days.<li>The bears will try to get it to close near its low, increasing the chance of a bear breakout. However, the bears know that if today remains an inside day and there is a bear breakout, there will probably be a reversal up within a few days.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-after-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption after bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

A bull day after a big bear day where there is very little overlap between the 2 days is bullish.<li>Many of Friday’s sellers did not exit today. If they exit this week, their short covering could lead to a new high.<li>Yesterday’s low was another test of the 50-day MA and the May 14 high. That high was the neckline for the May 12/May 19 double bottom.<li>There are 6 trading days left in June. The bulls want the Emini to close above the open of the month so that June will have a bull body on the monthly chart.<li>If June has a bear body, it will be a sell signal bar for a parabolic wedge buy climax on the monthly chart.<li>I have mentioned several times that the stock market tends to rally going into the 4<sup>th</sup>of July. The most reliable start of the rally is June 26. It is possible that the late June rally began today. If the bulls get follow-through buying, then the Emini will probably make a new high within the next 2 weeks.<li>Can today be a bull trap? Any rally can be a bull trap. If the Emini sells off strongly this week, there would be a head and shoulders top on the daily chart, where the May 7 high would be the left shoulder.<li>It is important to note that any top has only a 40% chance of leading to a bear trend. Therefore, it is more likely that any reversal down this week will simply be a bear leg in the 3-month trading range.<li>Because the Emini has been in a trading range, traders expect reversals.<li>The bears wanted Friday to lead to a bear breakout. The bulls want today to lead to a bull breakout and for last week’s selloff to be a late June bear trap.<li>But until there is a breakout, traders will continue to expect disappointing follow-through after strong moves up and down and then another reversal.<li>The strong 16-month rally and yesterday’s strong reversal up make a successful bull breakout slightly more likely than a bear breakout. If the bulls get a good 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive strong bull day tomorrow, there will probably be a new high soon.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 2 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day. Today therefore has at least a 75% chance of going sideways to down for at least a couple hours, starting by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour. It might get stuck in the trading range that set up after the first 90 minutes yesterday.<li>Even if today is mostly sideways, it should have at least one swing up and one swing down.<li>There is only a 25% chance that today will be a 2nd consecutive big bull day or big bear day.<li>While more trading range trading is likely, if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction in the 1st hour, there will be an increased chance of a strong trend day.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend-From-The-Open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-22.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bull Trend From The Open - rallying from bear trap in late June.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EURUSD-Forex-possible-ii-final-flag-in-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-22-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex possible ii final flag in sell climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>After 3 big bear bars and with the EURUSD still in an 11-month trading range, yesterday was not likely to be a big bear day. Instead, it was a big bull day.<li>Yesterday’s high was below Friday’s high and its low was above Friday’s low. Yesterday was therefore a bull inside bar.<li>That is a Breakout Mode setup. It is both a buy and sell signal bar for today.<li>Since it was a bull bar in a sell climax, it is a weak Low 1 sell signal bar. There will probably be buyers not far below its low.<li>For the bulls, they want the 3-day selloff to be a bear trap and a failed breakout below the May 5 bottom of a 2-month trading range.<li>So far, today is inside of yesterday’s range. If it remains an inside day, there will be consecutive inside bars (ii), which is a more reliable Breakout Mode Pattern.<li>An ii late in a bear trend usually either leads to a reversal up or it becomes a Final Bear Flag. That means if there is a bear breakout, it typically fails and the EURUSD reverses up within a few days.<li>Since the 3 bear bars were surprisingly big, the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up will probably be minor, even if it gets back above the bottom of the range at the May 5 low.<li>Since the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 11 months, traders should expect disappointment. Consequently, the rally might go above the May 5 low without 1<sup>st</sup>forming a micro double bottom. This would disappoint the bears who want a bear trend.<li>Whether or not it does, the bulls will probably need at least a small double bottom before they can get much above the June 16 sell climax high. The start of a sell climax is always a magnet when there is a reversal up.<li>The EURUSD will probably be sideways to up for at least a couple days and possibly for a couple weeks.<li>Last week’s selloff was so strong that traders expect at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down before there is a rally above the May high.<li>There is a 30% chance that this will be a V-bottom and that the EURUSD will go straight up to above the June 16 high in June.</ul><h3>EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Today reversed down from below yesterday’s high. So far, it is above yesterday’s low. It is therefore a 2nd consecutive inside day.<li>Today will probably not break far above or below yesterday’s range so today will likely not be a trend day.<li>Day traders so far today have been scalping in both directions<li>If it remains a 2nd inside day, the bulls will try to get it to close near the high. That would increase the chance of a rally over the next few days.<li>The bears will try to get it to close near its low, increasing the chance of a bear breakout. However, the bears know that if today remains an inside day and there is a bear breakout, there will probably be a reversal up within a few days.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-after-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption after bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

While the bull trend has been extreme and it will end at some point, most reversal attempts will fail. Traders should continue to expect higher prices. This week’s rally was yet another example.<li>Last week was a big bear bar, and it turned down from a double top with the May 7 high. The high was also just above a measured move up from last year’s March 23 low and June 25 high. The bears were hoping that this would end the Small Pullback Bull Trend.<li>However, this week was a big bull bar and it closed near the high of the week. Additionally, it closed at a new all-time high. It totally erased last week’s attempt at a top. The Emini might gap up next week on the weekly chart.<li>When the odds favor a top, yet the rally continues up, sometimes the bears completely give up. This can result in an acceleration up and a very strong rally. Early April was an example.<li>A strong rally late in a bull trend often attracts profit takers. If there is strong acceleration up over the next couple weeks, there would be a risk that the Emini might then abruptly reverse down. That would be a blow-off top and an exhaustive buy climax.<li>This might happen over the next few weeks for several reasons: it was reasonable to expect profit taking at the measured move target, yet the Emini is breaking above that resistance; the Emini stalled around 4,200 for a couple months and is now breaking above it; June 26 to July 5 is a seasonally bullish window; last week’s reversal up was very strong; and, the Fed will probably be quiet for at least a couple weeks after it changed its statement this month, which reduces the chance of a bearish surprise.</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-trading-range-so-possible-measured-move-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-6-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart breaking above trading range so possible measured move up\"></a></figure><ul><li>Strong rally on Monday and Tuesday with follow-through buying for the rest of the week.<li>Breakout to a new high.<li>6-bar bull micro channel and four of the past 5 days had bull bodies.<li>Bulls want a measured move up based on the height of the 3-month trading range.<li>There are many choices for the bottom and top of the range. However, the range is about 200 points tall, and the top was around 4,200. Therefore, a reasonable target is 4,400.<li>There is a 40% chance that this rally will reach that target this summer, and it could get there next week. However, the rally might top out somewhere below.<li>There is currently only a 30% chance of a correction starting in the next few weeks.<li>Traders will continue to buy 1- to 3-day selloffs, even when they are strong, like last week’s.<li>Long ago, the 4<sup>th</sup>of July week used to have light volume and lots of tight trading ranges. With most of the volume now traded by computers, this is less of an issue.</ul><h4 id=\"7-what-about-the-bears\">What about the bears?</h4><ul><li>The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they get even a minor reversal down. Therefore, the bulls will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>1- to 3-day pullback.<li>If the bears get a reversal down next week, it would be from the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg up in a wedge top. May 7 and June 14 were the 1<sup>st</sup>two tops.<li>If the reversal down was strong, traders would expect a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down. They would then wonder if the yearlong rally was finally ending and converting into a trading range.<li>Even though there should be a 15 – 20% correction this year after such a climactic rally, the bulls will buy it. The bull trend has been so strong that traders will expect a test back up to the prior high.<li>Therefore, the downside risk over the next few months is probably 20%. Any selloff should convert the bull trend into a trading range and not a bear trend.<li>After several months in a trading range, there would be a 40% chance of a trend reversal (into a bear trend) on the daily chart.</ul><h2 id=\"8-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It could reach the 4,400 measured move target before there is a correction.<li>The past 5 days were small, but each made a new high within bull micro channel. No credible top yet.<li>Yesterday was the 8<sup>th</sup>day without a pullback, which is extreme. That increases the chance that today will trade below yesterday’s low, creating a pullback.<li>Traders will buy the first 1- to 3-day pullback.<li>Strong bull trend and strong time of year through end of week so traders expect at least a little higher.<li>4<sup>th</sup>of July week is 2<sup>nd</sup>lightest trading of the year (Christmas is the slowest).<li>Still can get a big move at any time.<li>Friday’s unemployment report could be catalyst for big move up or down.<li>Today is the final day of June. On the monthly chart, June will probably be the 5<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar. The more it closes near its high, the more likely July will trade at least a little higher.<li>Bars often change their appearance just before they close.
