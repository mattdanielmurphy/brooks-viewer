It also closed just above the 4600 Big Round Number.<li>Since Friday was the last day of the month, with a gap up today, there will be a gap on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<li>September traded above the August high and then below the August low. It was therefore an outside down month.<li>October was an outside up month.<li>Consecutive outside bars is an Emini OO pattern (outside-outside) Breakout Mode. That means traders will buy above and sell below.<li>A minimum goal is a measured move based on the height of the Emini OO pattern. For the bulls, a measured move up is 4934.50.<li>Two weeks ago on the daily chart, the Emini also broke above a 4-month trading range. A measured move up based on that trading range is 4802.00.<li>Since October closed near its high, November should trade above the October high, which would trigger the OO buy signal. It will probably do that today or early this week.<li>There is always a bear case, and there is always at least a 40% chance of it happening.<li>The bears want a reversal down, even if there is first a breakout above the monthly OO pattern.<li>An inside bar after an outside bar is common. If November is a bear inside bar closing near its low, there would be an ioi Breakout mode pattern (August is inside of September’s range). That, or any bear bar closing near its low in November or December, would be a credible sell signal on the monthly chart.<li>At the moment, traders expect higher prices in November.<li>There is a seasonal tendency for the market to rally between October 26 and November 5. That increases the chance of a break above the October high this week.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 12 points in the overnight Globex session. It will probably gap up today, forming a gap up on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<li>A gap up to a new high increases the chance of a trend day today. If there is a trend, it is more likely to be in the direction of the gap (up).<li>When there is a gap, there is often an attempt to close the gap, especially in the 1st hour.<li>Bulls will look for a reversal up from around yesterday’s high. Sometimes a gap will close and the Emini will still reverse up and form a bear trend.<li>The bears want a Bear Trend From The Open.<li>If they cannot get that, they would like today to sell off at some point and then close below Friday’s high. That would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow.<li>However, the best they probably can get is a pullback lasting a few days.<li>The Emini has rallied in a tight bull channel for several weeks. That increases the chance of a pullback and then a 1- to 2-week trading range starting at any time.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-1.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open, bull trend resumption.

Thursday was therefore a bull trap. It was also a 2<sup>nd</sup>failed attempt to get back above the August 19 low.<li>On the weekly chart, last week traded above the high of the prior week and then below the low. It was therefore an outside down week. However, it had a prominent tail below the low and the low was above the low from 2 weeks ago. This is less bearish than it could have been. Since there is a 4-bar tight trading range, there is an increased chance of more sideways trading this week.<li>On the monthly chart, October was the third consecutive bear bar. However, it had a small body and closed a fraction of a pip above the September low. It, too, was therefore less bearish than it could have been.<li>I have been saying for several weeks that the EURUSD should fall below the March 9, 2020 high or the June 10, 2020 high. Friday increased the chance that it will happen within a couple weeks.<li>The EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years. Those 2 highs were breakout points for last year’s strong rally.<li>When a market is in a trading range and it gets near support or resistance, it usually goes beyond it before reversing.<li>That is the reason why I have written repeatedly that the EURUSD should fall to 1.15 or possibly 1.14.<li>However, last year’s rally was very strong, and it was stronger than the current reversal down from the May high. That makes it likely that the selloff is just a big pullback from last year’s rally.<li>Therefore, there should soon be a reversal up lasting at least several weeks, and it might reach the September 3 high. It should begin after a dip below one or both of those breakout points, but the reversal up can begin at any time.<li>There is always at least a 40% chance that the opposite of what is likely will happen. Consequently, there is about a 40% chance that the selloff will continue down to near the bottom of the 7-year trading range.<li>If the bears get consecutive bear bars closing near their lows and below the June 10, 2020 high, the odds of the selloff continuing to near last year’s low will be more than 50%.<li>At the moment, the EURUSD will probably fall to 1.15 or 1.14 within a few weeks, but then try to reverse up.<li>The bears need follow-through selling within a few days. If they do not get it, Friday will be just a sell vacuum test of the October 12 low and a bear trap, and the bulls will try to get a reversal up from a higher low major trend reversal.<li>A measured move up above the October 28 high, which is the neck line of the double bottom, would be almost to the September 3 high.<li>A measured move down would be below the June 10, 2020 high.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><ul><li>I will post chart after the close.</ul><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-then-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-1-3.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and then trading range day\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Small gap up on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts, but it closed in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour.<li>Minor reversal up from a parabolic wedge sell climax on the open.

It also closed just above the 4600 Big Round Number.<li>Since Friday was the last day of the month, with a gap up today, there will be a gap on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<li>September traded above the August high and then below the August low. It was therefore an outside down month.<li>October was an outside up month.<li>Consecutive outside bars is an Emini OO pattern (outside-outside) Breakout Mode. That means traders will buy above and sell below.<li>A minimum goal is a measured move based on the height of the Emini OO pattern. For the bulls, a measured move up is 4934.50.<li>Two weeks ago on the daily chart, the Emini also broke above a 4-month trading range. A measured move up based on that trading range is 4802.00.<li>Since October closed near its high, November should trade above the October high, which would trigger the OO buy signal. It will probably do that today or early this week.<li>There is always a bear case, and there is always at least a 40% chance of it happening.<li>The bears want a reversal down, even if there is first a breakout above the monthly OO pattern.<li>An inside bar after an outside bar is common. If November is a bear inside bar closing near its low, there would be an ioi Breakout mode pattern (August is inside of September’s range). That, or any bear bar closing near its low in November or December, would be a credible sell signal on the monthly chart.<li>At the moment, traders expect higher prices in November.<li>There is a seasonal tendency for the market to rally between October 26 and November 5. That increases the chance of a break above the October high this week.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 12 points in the overnight Globex session. It will probably gap up today, forming a gap up on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<li>A gap up to a new high increases the chance of a trend day today. If there is a trend, it is more likely to be in the direction of the gap (up).<li>When there is a gap, there is often an attempt to close the gap, especially in the 1st hour.<li>Bulls will look for a reversal up from around yesterday’s high. Sometimes a gap will close and the Emini will still reverse up and form a bear trend.<li>The bears want a Bear Trend From The Open.<li>If they cannot get that, they would like today to sell off at some point and then close below Friday’s high. That would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow.<li>However, the best they probably can get is a pullback lasting a few days.<li>The Emini has rallied in a tight bull channel for several weeks. That increases the chance of a pullback and then a 1- to 2-week trading range starting at any time.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-1.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open, bull trend resumption.

That usually leads to a trading range, which means a couple legs sideways to down. It should begin within a couple weeks.<li>The Fed is in the process of changing its policy. That increases the chance of a surprise.<li>A surprise can affect the market for a couple weeks. But, if the surprise is bearish, the best the bears will likely get is a trading range for a couple weeks.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 6 points in the overnight Globex session. Today will probably open within yesterday’s trading range.<li>That would increase the chance of it staying within the range going into today’s November FOMC announcement today at 11:00 am PT.<li>Day traders should exit positions ahead of the report.<li>There is usually a sharp move up and down in the 1<sup>st</sup>few minutes after the report. Day traders usually should wait until at least 10 minutes after the report before resuming trading.<li>In only 20% of the time, the report leads to a strong trend up or down and lasting for the rest of the day.<li>More often, even if there is a strong trend, there is usually an opposite swing before the close.<li>Day traders should be open to anything after the report.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.

Will gap up today.<li>Parabolic wedge buy climax that is testing top of tight bull channel at 4693 created by October 7 and September 2 highs.<li>Next targets are 4700 Big Round Number and top of channel created by May 7 and September highs, which is at 4713 today.<li>Above that is the measured move target at 4802.00, based on the height of the summer trading range.<li>After 3 bull days opening near their lows and closing near their highs, traders might begin to take some profits today or Monday.<li>While there is a parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart, the bears typically will need a micro double top before they can get more than a 3-day pullback. They do not even have a bear bar yet.<li>If today reverses down, the reversal will probably only last 1 to 3 days.<li>There is a seasonal tendency to pull back in the 2<sup>nd</sup>week of November, but there is a strong tendency to rally from November 11 to December 5.<li>I do not trade seasonal tendencies because it is very difficult to construct a profitable strategy using them. However, they are factors to consider. Traders looking for a big selloff in a bull trend during a seasonally bullish time need very strong bear bars before shorting.<li>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>So far, the week is a bull bar closing near its high. The tops of the 2 channels and the 4700 Big Round Number are magnets for the bulls.<li>For the bears, the low of the week is probably too far below for it to be a magnet today.<li>As an alternative, the bears will try to get the week to close below the middle of the week’s range. That would increase the chance that next week would be sideways instead of up.<li>The closer to the high of the week that the week closes, the more likely next week will trade higher.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 20 points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap up.<li>It is at the top of the tight bull channel in a parabolic wedge buy climax, but there is no top yet and there are other magnets above (4700 Big Round Number and 4713 top of bull channel on daily and weekly charts).<li>Big gap increases chance of trend day. If there is a trend, it is slightly more likely to be in the direction of the gap (here, up).<li>Can it break far above 4713 at the top of the channel? The bull trend is extremely strong. If the market is forming consecutive bull bars closing near their highs, traders will buy and not worry about resistance.<li>Because the daily chart is so overbought and in a resistance area, a big bear trend can come at any time.<li>The bears will need a couple big bear bars closing near their lows before looking for lower prices. Or, if there is a big bear bar on the open closing near its low, that would be a sell signal for a possible Bear Trend From The Open.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-then-triangle-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-5.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax then triangle with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It therefore met the minimum expectation of the bears who were looking for a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down.<li>In the minutes after today’s unemployment report, today broke below the October 12 bottom of the month-long trading range.<li>The bulls are still hoping for a reversal up from a lower low double bottom. They want a measured move above the October 28 neckline, which would be a test of the January 3 high.<li>They need a bull bar closing near its high within the next few days to convince traders that a double bottom reversal is underway.<li>Without that, the odds still favor a test below the March 9, 2020 high. That was the breakout point for last summer’s strong rally. Since the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years, traders should expect it to go beyond support or resistance before reversing because that is what typically happens.<li>If there is a strong reversal up within the next week, traders will expect a move up to the October 28 high and maybe the September 3 high without first dropping below the March 9, 2020 high.<li>Whether or not the selloff continues down to below the March 9, 2020 high or the lower breakout point of the June 10, 2020 high, traders should expect a reversal up lasting several weeks before the EURUSD falls much below that support. Trading ranges have reversals and breakouts tend to fail.<li>It is possible that the rally might not come until January 1.

Will gap up today.<li>Parabolic wedge buy climax that is testing top of tight bull channel at 4693 created by October 7 and September 2 highs.<li>Next targets are 4700 Big Round Number and top of channel created by May 7 and September highs, which is at 4713 today.<li>Above that is the measured move target at 4802.00, based on the height of the summer trading range.<li>After 3 bull days opening near their lows and closing near their highs, traders might begin to take some profits today or Monday.<li>While there is a parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart, the bears typically will need a micro double top before they can get more than a 3-day pullback. They do not even have a bear bar yet.<li>If today reverses down, the reversal will probably only last 1 to 3 days.<li>There is a seasonal tendency to pull back in the 2<sup>nd</sup>week of November, but there is a strong tendency to rally from November 11 to December 5.<li>I do not trade seasonal tendencies because it is very difficult to construct a profitable strategy using them. However, they are factors to consider. Traders looking for a big selloff in a bull trend during a seasonally bullish time need very strong bear bars before shorting.<li>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>So far, the week is a bull bar closing near its high. The tops of the 2 channels and the 4700 Big Round Number are magnets for the bulls.<li>For the bears, the low of the week is probably too far below for it to be a magnet today.<li>As an alternative, the bears will try to get the week to close below the middle of the week’s range. That would increase the chance that next week would be sideways instead of up.<li>The closer to the high of the week that the week closes, the more likely next week will trade higher.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 20 points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap up.<li>It is at the top of the tight bull channel in a parabolic wedge buy climax, but there is no top yet and there are other magnets above (4700 Big Round Number and 4713 top of bull channel on daily and weekly charts).<li>Big gap increases chance of trend day. If there is a trend, it is slightly more likely to be in the direction of the gap (here, up).<li>Can it break far above 4713 at the top of the channel? The bull trend is extremely strong. If the market is forming consecutive bull bars closing near their highs, traders will buy and not worry about resistance.<li>Because the daily chart is so overbought and in a resistance area, a big bear trend can come at any time.<li>The bears will need a couple big bear bars closing near their lows before looking for lower prices. Or, if there is a big bear bar on the open closing near its low, that would be a sell signal for a possible Bear Trend From The Open.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-then-triangle-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-5.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax then triangle with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Forex-testing-double-bottom-after-double-top-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-5-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex testing double bottom after double top\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday was a big bear day and it traded below the October 29 sell climax low.

Will gap up today.<li>Parabolic wedge buy climax that is testing top of tight bull channel at 4693 created by October 7 and September 2 highs.<li>Next targets are 4700 Big Round Number and top of channel created by May 7 and September highs, which is at 4713 today.<li>Above that is the measured move target at 4802.00, based on the height of the summer trading range.<li>After 3 bull days opening near their lows and closing near their highs, traders might begin to take some profits today or Monday.<li>While there is a parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart, the bears typically will need a micro double top before they can get more than a 3-day pullback. They do not even have a bear bar yet.<li>If today reverses down, the reversal will probably only last 1 to 3 days.<li>There is a seasonal tendency to pull back in the 2<sup>nd</sup>week of November, but there is a strong tendency to rally from November 11 to December 5.<li>I do not trade seasonal tendencies because it is very difficult to construct a profitable strategy using them. However, they are factors to consider. Traders looking for a big selloff in a bull trend during a seasonally bullish time need very strong bear bars before shorting.<li>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>So far, the week is a bull bar closing near its high. The tops of the 2 channels and the 4700 Big Round Number are magnets for the bulls.<li>For the bears, the low of the week is probably too far below for it to be a magnet today.<li>As an alternative, the bears will try to get the week to close below the middle of the week’s range. That would increase the chance that next week would be sideways instead of up.<li>The closer to the high of the week that the week closes, the more likely next week will trade higher.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 20 points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap up.<li>It is at the top of the tight bull channel in a parabolic wedge buy climax, but there is no top yet and there are other magnets above (4700 Big Round Number and 4713 top of bull channel on daily and weekly charts).<li>Big gap increases chance of trend day. If there is a trend, it is slightly more likely to be in the direction of the gap (here, up).<li>Can it break far above 4713 at the top of the channel? The bull trend is extremely strong. If the market is forming consecutive bull bars closing near their highs, traders will buy and not worry about resistance.<li>Because the daily chart is so overbought and in a resistance area, a big bear trend can come at any time.<li>The bears will need a couple big bear bars closing near their lows before looking for lower prices. Or, if there is a big bear bar on the open closing near its low, that would be a sell signal for a possible Bear Trend From The Open.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-then-triangle-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-5.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax then triangle with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.

When there is a trading range, traders look for reversals, especially after going beyond support or resistance.<li>The most important support below is at the breakout points of last year’s strong rally. They are the March 9, 2020 high at around 1.15 and June 10, 2020 high at around 1.14.<li>At the moment, the EURUSD will probably dip below one or both before the 6-month bear trend ends.<li>The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a bear trend. There is currently only a 30% chance that it will continue down for a 700-pip measured move (based on the head and shoulders top) to last year’s low.<li>Therefore, traders should expect a test back up before there is a break below last year’s low.<li>It should occur from either around the current level or from around 1.15 or 1.14.<li>If the bulls start to form some big bull bars, the odds will be that the reversal up has begun.

They want a measured move above the October 28 neckline, which would result in a test of the September 3 high.<li>There is also a wedge bull flag with October 18 and 29. When the 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down in a double bottom is a wedge, there is an increased chance of a reversal up.<li>But unless the bulls begin to create several big bull bars closing near their highs, the odds are that the 7-month bear trend will continue lower.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Monthly-Breakout-Above-Outside-Outside-Pattern.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-7-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart Breakout above Outside-Outside Pattern\"></a></figure><ul><li>The November monthly Emini candlestick currently is a bull bar at a new high. It so far is a strong breakout above the Sept-Oct OO (outside-outside) pattern.<li>The bulls want a test of the trend channel line around 4820 and a measured move to 4934.50 based on the height of the OO pattern (which is the height of the October bar).&nbsp;<li>September was the third time that a bear bar interrupted the strong rally on the monthly chart. A third reversal attempt has a higher probability of leading to a 2- to 3-bar sideways to down pullback.<li>Al has said that most prior bear bars in buy climaxes on the monthly chart led to a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar within a bar or two. That means the bears hope that November rallies and then reverses down at the end of the month to close below the open of the month.<li>Will that happen? With October being surprisingly strong, November will likely be another bull bar. Traders will begin to wonder if the Emini will reach the 5,000 Big Round Number before there is more than a one-month reversal.<li>How much higher can the buy climax continue? Climactic rallies often last far longer than what might appear reasonable.<li>An OO pattern is a pause and a brief area of agreement. It is usually an expanding triangle on a smaller time frame.&nbsp;<li>A breakout from a triangle usually tests back to the triangle, where the bulls and bears last agreed on a fair price.<li>Therefore, there is an increased chance that it will be the Final Bull Flag before there is a correction lasting at least a few bars (months).&nbsp;<li>However, the breakout above the OO often lasts several bars before there is a reversal.&nbsp;<li>For now, the odds favor at least slightly higher prices in November.<li>However, there is always a bear case, and it always has at least a 40% chance of happening.<li>But even if it does, the best the bears will probably get is 2 to 3 months of sideways to down trading before the bulls try for another leg up.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Weekly-5-Consecutive-Bull-Bars-Testing-Trend-Channel-Line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-7-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart 5 Consecutive Bull Bars Testing Trend Channel Line\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was the 5<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar. It closed at a new high and it is testing the top of the bull channel.<li>While 5 consecutive bull bars closing near its high is a strong spike, it is also climactic on the weekly chart.<li>It increases the odds that we may soon see some profit taking, resulting in a sideways to down pullback.<li>The next target for the bulls is 4802.00. That is the measured move target based on the height of the 4-month trading range (Jul-Oct).<li>Should the Emini reach there, it would result in a trend channel line overshoot, which usually leads to a pullback into the channel after that.<li>Al has said that while there was a 50% chance that the Small Pullback Bull Trend was ending in September, there was also a 50% chance that it would continue. The strong rally over the past 4 weeks shows that the trend is intact.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend is a bull trend where the pullbacks are small. This one began with the pandemic crash. The biggest pullback was 10% and it came a year ago.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend ends with a big pullback. That means a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than the biggest prior pullback. Here, the trend will remain intact until there is at least a 15% correction.&nbsp;<li>Once it ends, the bull trend typically converts into a trading range. Initially, the odds are that it will be a bull flag. Traders should expect the trend to resume. If it does, it is usually a weaker bull trend.<li>If the trading range lasts 20 or more bars, the probability of a reversal into a bear trend begins to get close to 50%.<li>The bears want a higher high major trend reversal with the September high. However, the 5 strong bull bars after a 6-bar bear microchannel was a low probability event. A surprise typically has at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up.&nbsp;<li>Therefore, the bears would need a surprisingly strong bear bar or a micro double top before traders would look for a reversal.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to up for November.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-daily-candlestick-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-at-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-7-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini parabolic wedge on daily candlestick chart at top of bull channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini continued to make new high every day this week. Friday was a bear doji but had a big tail below, so it is a weak sell signal bar.<li>The dominant feature is a parabolic wedge buy climax at top of the bull channel.&nbsp;<li>The bears want at least a 1- to 3-day pullback or a reversal down.<li>It would also be from an expanding triangle. The final leg up in the triangle began on October 4. It has been very strong. That means most traders no longer see this as an expanding triangle.<li>The bears will need at least a micro double top or a few consecutive bear bars closing near their lows before traders will think about a possible reversal down.<li>The move up since October 13 is in a tight bull channel which means relentless bulls. Odds are bulls will buy the first 1- to 3-day pullback for a second leg sideways to up move.<li>Al has said that there is a seasonal tendency to pull back in the 2<sup>nd</sup>week of November, but there is a strong tendency to rally from November 11 to December 5.<li>However, seasonal tendencies are minor since it is very difficult to construct a profitable strategy using them.<li>Traders looking for a big selloff in a bull trend during a seasonally bullish time need very strong bear bars before shorting. A seasonal tendency is not enough.<li>The daily chart is overbought and in a resistance area so a big bear trend day can come at any time.<li>The rally since October has been extreme. That increases the chance of several sideways to down days soon.&nbsp;<li>With the Emini as overbought as it is, bulls will begin to take some profits soon. This will probably create a trading range lasting at least a couple of weeks starting within a few weeks.<li>But unless the bears get several consecutive big bear bars closing near the lows, the odds continue to favor at least slightly higher prices.

They will try to overpower the bears again today and create another new high. So far, there has been a new high every day in November, and the bulls want the streak to continue.<li>However, the bear bar and the buy climax at resistance should attract some profit taking early this week. That reduces the chance of a big bull day today.<li>Furthermore, it increases the chance of sideways to down trading early this week.<li>Because the Emini is so overbought, the profit taking could be big and fast. That increases the chance of a strong bear day this week.<li>If there are early consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows, that would increase the chance of a bear trend day.<li>What about a strong bull trend day?

Since yesterday closed below its midpoint and below Monday’s low, and it had a big bear body, today should trade sideways to a little lower.<li>Because the bull trend has been strong, this reversal down is probably minor. That means it should last only a few days before the bulls buy again.<li>There are now 3 consecutive bear bars. That is enough selling to usually lead to a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>A parabolic wedge buy climax typically also has at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>Consequently, even if the bulls buy again today or tomorrow, the reversal up will probably only last a day or two.<li>With the bulls looking to buy the selloff and the bears looking to sell the 1<sup>st</sup>bounce, the Emini will probably be mostly sideways for a few days. With the buy climax on the daily chart being as extreme as it has been, the Emini could enter a trading range for a couple weeks.<li>Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar in a strong bull trend. But since at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down is likely and it is the 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive bear bar, there will probably be sellers not far above yesterday’s high.<li>Can these 3 bear bars be the start of a 15% correction? Of course, and a correction is becoming increasingly likely.<li>However, I have been saying since the pandemic crash that it is more likely that every reversal down will be minor than the start of a bear trend. That is true here as well.<li>One of these reversals will eventually lead to a correction, but picking which one is a low probability bet.<li>The bears will need several more big bear bars before traders conclude that a correction might be underway.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 15 points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap below yesterday’s low.<li>If there is a gap down and it is small, it will probably close within the 1<sup>st</sup>hour.<li>The bears want a 4th bear day. If there is a series of bear bars early in the day, today will more likely continue yesterday’s trading range and bear channel.<li>If the bulls get a series of early big bull bars, today could be a bull trend day. However, today will have a difficult time getting much above yesterday’s trading range high.<li>Trading ranges are magnets, and that increases the chance of either a trading range or a continuation of yesterday’s broad bear channel, which traders will trade like a trading range.<li>Because the sell climax was extreme and yesterday was the 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive bear day, the sellers might be exhausted. This increases the chance of a continuation of yesterday’s trading range.<li>The bears want a resumption down from yesterday’s early selling and the bulls want a trend reversal up.<li>But 3 big down days after a strong rally creates confusion. Yesterday’s trading range might not have lasted long enough for traders to bet relentlessly on either direction.<li>Unless there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, traders will look for reversals.<li>Even if today is a trading range day, there should be at least one swing and probably two.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-10.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open then trading range.

Since yesterday closed below its midpoint and below Monday’s low, and it had a big bear body, today should trade sideways to a little lower.<li>Because the bull trend has been strong, this reversal down is probably minor. That means it should last only a few days before the bulls buy again.<li>There are now 3 consecutive bear bars. That is enough selling to usually lead to a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>A parabolic wedge buy climax typically also has at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>Consequently, even if the bulls buy again today or tomorrow, the reversal up will probably only last a day or two.<li>With the bulls looking to buy the selloff and the bears looking to sell the 1<sup>st</sup>bounce, the Emini will probably be mostly sideways for a few days. With the buy climax on the daily chart being as extreme as it has been, the Emini could enter a trading range for a couple weeks.<li>Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar in a strong bull trend. But since at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down is likely and it is the 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive bear bar, there will probably be sellers not far above yesterday’s high.<li>Can these 3 bear bars be the start of a 15% correction? Of course, and a correction is becoming increasingly likely.<li>However, I have been saying since the pandemic crash that it is more likely that every reversal down will be minor than the start of a bear trend. That is true here as well.<li>One of these reversals will eventually lead to a correction, but picking which one is a low probability bet.<li>The bears will need several more big bear bars before traders conclude that a correction might be underway.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 15 points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap below yesterday’s low.<li>If there is a gap down and it is small, it will probably close within the 1<sup>st</sup>hour.<li>The bears want a 4th bear day. If there is a series of bear bars early in the day, today will more likely continue yesterday’s trading range and bear channel.<li>If the bulls get a series of early big bull bars, today could be a bull trend day. However, today will have a difficult time getting much above yesterday’s trading range high.<li>Trading ranges are magnets, and that increases the chance of either a trading range or a continuation of yesterday’s broad bear channel, which traders will trade like a trading range.<li>Because the sell climax was extreme and yesterday was the 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive bear day, the sellers might be exhausted. This increases the chance of a continuation of yesterday’s trading range.<li>The bears want a resumption down from yesterday’s early selling and the bulls want a trend reversal up.<li>But 3 big down days after a strong rally creates confusion. Yesterday’s trading range might not have lasted long enough for traders to bet relentlessly on either direction.<li>Unless there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, traders will look for reversals.<li>Even if today is a trading range day, there should be at least one swing and probably two.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-10.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open then trading range.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-10-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top bear flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>Turning down from double top bear flag with November 3 high.

A third reversal attempt has a higher probability of leading to a 2- to 3-bar sideways to down pullback.<li>Al has said that most prior bear bars in buy climaxes on the monthly chart led to a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar within a bar or two. That means the bears hope that November rallies and then reverses down at the end of the month to close below the open of the month. Therefore, the bears will try to create a bear bar in November. If they are successful, it will probably lead to lower prices in December.<li>Will that happen? With October being surprisingly strong, November will likely be another bull bar. Traders will begin to wonder if the Emini will reach the 5,000 Big Round Number before there is more than a one-month reversal.<li>How much higher can the buy climax continue? Climactic rallies often last far longer than what might appear reasonable.<li>An OO pattern is a pause and a brief area of agreement. It is usually an expanding triangle on a smaller time frame.&nbsp;<li>A breakout from a triangle usually tests back to the triangle, where the bulls and bears last agreed on a fair price.<li>Therefore, there is an increased chance that it will be the Final Bull Flag before there is a correction lasting at least a few bars (months).&nbsp;<li>However, the breakout above the OO often lasts several bars before there is a reversal.&nbsp;<li>For now, the odds slightly favor sideways to up in November.&nbsp;<li>However, there is always a bear case, and it always has at least a 40% chance of happening.&nbsp;<li>But even if it does, the best the bears will probably get is 2 to 3 months of sideways to down trading before the bulls try for another leg up.&nbsp;</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Weekly-Bear-Doji-with-Long-Tail-Below-–-Weak-Pullback.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-14-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini weekly chart bear doji with long tail below - weak pullback\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was an inside bear doji closing at the upper third of its range with a long tail below. It ended the 5-bull bar streak but failed to trade below the prior week’s low.<li>A bear doji closing in the upper third of its range is a weak sell signal bar for a strong reversal down. This is especially true as it follows a 5-bar bull microchannel which means strong bulls.<li>The bears want a higher high major trend reversal with the September high. The bears would need a surprisingly strong bear bar or a micro double top before traders would look for a reversal.<li>Al has said that there is a seasonal strong tendency to rally from November 11 to December 5. However, it is very difficult to construct a profitable strategy using them, but they are factors to consider. Traders looking for a big selloff in a bull trend, during a seasonally bullish time, need very strong bear bars before shorting.<li>The next target for the bulls is 4802.00. That is the measured move target based on the height of the 4-month trading range (Jul-Oct).<li>Should the Emini reach there, it would result in a trend channel line overshoot, which usually leads to a pullback into the channel after that.<li>So far, the Small Pullback Bull Trend is still intact. A Small Pullback Bull Trend ends with a big pullback. That means a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than the biggest prior pullback. Here, the trend will remain intact until there is at least a 15% correction.&nbsp;<li>Once it ends, the bull trend typically converts into a trading range. Initially, the odds are that it will be a bull flag. Traders should expect the trend to resume. If it does, it is usually a weaker bull trend. If the trading range lasts 20 or more bars, the probability of a reversal into a bear trend begins to get close to 50%.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to up for November unless the bears can create consecutive strong bear bars closing near its low.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Daily-Pullback-from-Parabolic-Wedge-at-Top-of-Bull-Channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-14-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini daily chart. Emini weak pullback form parabolic wedge at to of bull channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini candlesticks from Monday to Wednesday were bear bars but all had prominent tails below. Thursday was a bear inside bar therefore Breakout Mode and Friday broke above it and closed as a bull bar with a small tail above.<li>Al has said that because the bull trend has been strong, this reversal down is probably minor. That means it should last only a few days before the bulls buy again.<li>The 5 consecutive bear bars were enough selling to usually lead to a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down. A parabolic wedge buy climax typically also has at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down. Consequently, even if the bulls buy early next week, the reversal up will probably only last few days.&nbsp;<li>With the bulls looking to buy the selloff and the bears looking to sell the 1<sup>st</sup>bounce, the Emini will probably be mostly sideways for a few days. With the buy climax on the daily chart being as extreme as it has been, the Emini could enter a trading range for a couple weeks.<li>The 4-day selloff came after a strong rally on the daily chart. This creates a Big Up, Big Down, Big Confusion pattern, which typically leads to a trading range. Therefore, there is an increased chance of sideways trading for a few days.<li>Is this the high of the year? It might be, but there have been many other attempts at a bear trend reversal and all have failed. Therefore, the odds continue to favor higher prices.&nbsp;<li>The bears need more strong bear bars before traders will conclude that a correction is underway. Traders will continue to bet on new highs until there is a clear, strong reversal down.</ul><h2 id=\"8-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Emini is testing the 4700 Big Round Number.<li>The November 5<sup>th</sup>top came from just below the top of the 15-month bull channel. Some traders believe that the resistance was not adequately tested. They want to see a reversal down from above the top of the channel. Since the channel is rising, the top is now around 4740. It is a magnet above.<li>I wrote last week that while the selloff was strong, every strong selloff since the pandemic crash was a bull flag and led to a new high.<li>What is different this time is that the November 5 high was a reversal down from the top of a month-long parabolic wedge and the top of a 6-month bull channel. That increases the chance of at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down before the rally gets much above the high or above the top of the 15-month bull channel.<li>But even if there is a double top reversal, traders will still buy it.<li>This has been an extremely strong bull trend and at no point did the bears ever have more than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>They will need an extremely strong selloff, probably to below the bottom of the bull channel, before many traders will think that a correction is likely. Until then, they will buy every reversal down.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 15 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>It will gap up. The bulls want a strong breakout above the 4700 Big Round Number and then a new all-time high.<li>However, Friday had a very strong rally, but then entered a trading range for several hours. That is an area of agreement and therefore a magnet. If there is a reversal down in the 1<sup>st</sup>couple hours, it will probably continue down to the middle of Friday’s range.<li>The Emini went sideways for several days last week around 4700. Also, the selloff had 5 consecutive bear days, which is relentless selling. Both of these facts increase the chance that yesterday’s rally will stall again here for at least a couple days.<li>While a trading range around 4700 is likely for a few days, any day can be a trend day. If there is a series of strong trend bars in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour, traders will expect a trend day.<li>If there is a trend, up is more likely after Friday’s strong rally.</ul><h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Forex-just-above-2020-breakout-points-and-measured-move.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-15.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex just above 2020 breakout points and measured move\"></a></figure><ul><li>I have been writing regularly for a couple months that the EURUSD would probably have to fall below the March 9, 2020 high.<li>That is because it has been in a trading range for 7 years and when in a trading range, a leg up usually begins after falling below support.<li>That high was the breakout point of last year’s strong rally. It is therefore important support and a strong magnet. The EURUSD broke below it last week.<li>I also said that the selloff might continue down to below the June 10, 2020 high, which is a less important breakout point.<li>Since the EURUSD has already done the minimum, there is now an increased chance of a reversal up at any time.<li>Last week’s big bear day was a strong enough Surprise Bar for traders to expect at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down.<li>The EURUSD will probably fall below the June 10, 2020 high because the momentum down is strong and that price is almost exactly a measured move down from the October trading range.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this year’s bear trend will continue all of the way to the bottom of last year’s rally or below the bottom of the 7-year range.<li>However, if the bears continue to form bear bars on the weekly and month charts, that probability will go higher.<li>While the selloff should go a little lower, there is better than a 50% chance that there will be a 1- to 2-month rally from around where the EURUSD currently is or from around the June 26, 2020 low, which was the 1<sup>st</sup>pullback from last year’s breakout of the triangle bottom.<li>With important magnets just above 1.14 and the momentum down strong, the odds favor at least slightly lower prices over the next couple weeks.<li>Since major currency reversals have an increased chance of beginning at the start of a year, the selloff might continue through December.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Bear-trending-trading-range-day-at-60-minue-EMA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-15-1.png\" alt=\"Emini Bear trending trading range day at 60 minute EMA\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>The Emini had a small gap up, but it closed in the first hour, which is typical with small gaps.<li>After trading in a tight trading range for a couple hours, there was a Major Bear Surprise Bar.<li>Since its low was at the 60-minute EMA and one tick below yesterday’s trading range low, it was a good candidate for a 2<sup>nd</sup>Leg Bear Trap. And that is what it turned out to be. Bears bought back shorts and bulls bought, betting on a bounce.<li>The Emini then entered a lower trading range and formed a Bear Trending Trading Range Day.<li>The bears see today as a lower high sell signal bar for tomorrow. There is now a lower high double top on the daily chart with the November 5 all-time high.<li>However, the Emini is more likely to continue the 8-day tight trading range for at least another day.

Also, the selloff had 5 consecutive bear days, which is relentless selling.

Emini testing November high (November 5).<li>Last week was a bear bar on the weekly chart, which is a weak buy signal bar.<li>Yesterday closed back below last week’s high and back below the 4700 Big Round Number. It closed just above the midpoint of the day’s range.<li>However, I have been saying that the rally is strong enough for traders to expect it to break at least a little above the top of the 15-month bull channel on the weekly chart within the next few weeks.<li>There are several ways to draw the channel. The best way has the channel line at 4745 this week, and it will be at 4768 next week.<li>Traders should expect at least slightly higher prices, even if the Emini stalls around the November 5 all-time high for a few days.<li>The bears want a reversal down from around that November 5 high. That would be a double top on the daily chart.<li>But with the bull trend as strong as it has been, traders will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>1- to 3-day reversal. The rally should reach the top of the weekly bull channel before traders will consider the possibility of a correction.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 4 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a Spike and Channel Bull Trend on the 5-minute chart. There is typically a reversal down to the start of the channel and then a conversion into a trading range.<li>Yesterday sold off to below the start of the channel. That increases the chance of an early trading range today.<li>If today is a bull trend day, it will probably be a weaker type, like a Broad Bull Channel or a Trending Trading Range Day.<li>Markets often stall at prior highs. That increases the chance of the Emini being sideways for a couple days.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Spike-and-Channel-bull-trend-then-midday-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-17.png\" alt=\"Emini testing November high. A Spike and Channel bull trend yesterday with midday trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Forex-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-17-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>After 5 strong days down, there should be some minor profit taking soon for a few days.<li>Today so far is a reversal day. If today closes above its midpoint, it should lead to a few days of sideways to up trading from bears taking profits and bulls looking for a bounce.<li>The selloff has had 3 legs down in a tight bear channel that began in November 5. That is a parabolic wedge sell climax, which typically leads to a bounce with at least a couple legs sideways to up.<li>The past 3 days broke far below the bear channel. There is a 75% chance of a reversal back up into the channel starting within 5 days. This should limit the downside over the next few days.<li>The EURUSD can get back in the channel by going sideways or up. Because of the parabolic wedge sell climax, it should bounce.<li>Can this be the bottom of the bear trend that began in January? It is more likely that the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up will be minor. The bulls usually will need at least a double bottom before they can get a bull trend reversal.<li>If there is a reversal up, the 1<sup>st</sup>target is the breakout point, which is the bottom of the bear channel (blue line). Next is the November 5 low at the bottom of the month-long trading range<li>Above that is the top of the most recent sell climax, which is the November 9 high.<li>If the week closes near the low of the week, this week would be the 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive big bear bar on the weekly chart. That would be a strong breakout below last year’s breakout point. The summer rally broke strongly above the March 9, 2020 high.

Emini testing November high (November 5).<li>Last week was a bear bar on the weekly chart, which is a weak buy signal bar.<li>Yesterday closed back below last week’s high and back below the 4700 Big Round Number. It closed just above the midpoint of the day’s range.<li>However, I have been saying that the rally is strong enough for traders to expect it to break at least a little above the top of the 15-month bull channel on the weekly chart within the next few weeks.<li>There are several ways to draw the channel. The best way has the channel line at 4745 this week, and it will be at 4768 next week.<li>Traders should expect at least slightly higher prices, even if the Emini stalls around the November 5 all-time high for a few days.<li>The bears want a reversal down from around that November 5 high. That would be a double top on the daily chart.<li>But with the bull trend as strong as it has been, traders will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>1- to 3-day reversal. The rally should reach the top of the weekly bull channel before traders will consider the possibility of a correction.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 4 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a Spike and Channel Bull Trend on the 5-minute chart. There is typically a reversal down to the start of the channel and then a conversion into a trading range.<li>Yesterday sold off to below the start of the channel. That increases the chance of an early trading range today.<li>If today is a bull trend day, it will probably be a weaker type, like a Broad Bull Channel or a Trending Trading Range Day.<li>Markets often stall at prior highs. That increases the chance of the Emini being sideways for a couple days.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Spike-and-Channel-bull-trend-then-midday-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-17.png\" alt=\"Emini testing November high.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Forex-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-17-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>After 5 strong days down, there should be some minor profit taking soon for a few days.<li>Today so far is a reversal day. If today closes above its midpoint, it should lead to a few days of sideways to up trading from bears taking profits and bulls looking for a bounce.<li>The selloff has had 3 legs down in a tight bear channel that began in November 5. That is a parabolic wedge sell climax, which typically leads to a bounce with at least a couple legs sideways to up.<li>The past 3 days broke far below the bear channel. There is a 75% chance of a reversal back up into the channel starting within 5 days. This should limit the downside over the next few days.<li>The EURUSD can get back in the channel by going sideways or up. Because of the parabolic wedge sell climax, it should bounce.<li>Can this be the bottom of the bear trend that began in January? It is more likely that the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up will be minor.

Next is the November 5 low at the bottom of the month-long trading range<li>Above that is the top of the most recent sell climax, which is the November 9 high.<li>If the week closes near the low of the week, this week would be the 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive big bear bar on the weekly chart.

Next is the November 5 low at the bottom of the month-long trading range<li>Above that is the top of the most recent sell climax, which is the November 9 high.<li>If the week closes near the low of the week, this week would be the 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive big bear bar on the weekly chart. That would be a strong breakout below last year’s breakout point. The summer rally broke strongly above the March 9, 2020 high. That breakout point should have been support.<li>Consecutive big bear bars on the weekly chart closing near their lows would make it likely that the selloff will continue down to the next support, which is the June 19, 2020 low of 1.1168.<li>Before this week’s big bear breakout, I said that the bears only had a 30% chance of a break below the bottom of last year’s rally. That is the March 23, 2020 low of 1.0636.<li>If this week closes near its low, the bears would have a 40% chance of achieving that goal.<li>But that means there is still a 60% chance of a rally from above that low. If there is a rally, it could last a couple months.<li>There should be a rally back into the bear channel over the next couple weeks even if there is a brief leg down for a few days first.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-then-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and then triangle\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Bear Trend From The Open, but reversed up from a parabolic wedge not far below the 60-minute EMA.<li>The EMAs on the 5- and 60-minute charts were flat and near one another from the end of the first hour.

Therefore, the November 5 high of 4711.75 is a magnet.<li>The bears want the week to close below that high and below last week’s high.<li>They also want the week to close below the open of the week. This week would then have a bear body, which would increase the chance of sideways to down trading next week.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 2 points in the overnight Globex session. It should open near the middle of yesterday’s trading range. It therefore might continue sideways, as it has been doing for 4 days.<li>However, the Emini has been in a tight bull channel for 7 days on the 60-minute chart. A bull channel is a bear flag since there is a 75% chance of a break below the channel and then a swing sideways to down.<li>There have been swings up and down during most recent days. Traders are deciding if the rally will break strongly above the all-time high and reach the top of the weekly channel, or reverse down from a double top with the November 5 high.<li>In either case, there can be a strong trend. If there is a series of strong trend bars in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour in either direction, traders will look for a trend day.<li>But if there is hesitation and reversals, they will expect at least one swing up and one swing down today.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-outside-up-after-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-19.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up after sell climax.

Emini bulls want to test bull channel top on weekly chart at 4775.<li>It barely closed back above the 4700 Big Round Number and just below the all-time high, which is disappointing for the bulls.<li>After 4 sideways days at resistance, there should be a breakout up or down soon.<li>The bulls want a close above the November 5 all-time high.<li>If the week closes near the high of the week, that would increase the chance of a gap up on the weekly chart next week.<li>It would also increase the chance that the Emini will test bull channel top of the weekly bull channel, which will be around 4775 next week.<li>If the week closes near the low, there will be a micro double top on the weekly chart, which would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<li>Today is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>The bulls want the week to close at a new high. Therefore, the November 5 high of 4711.75 is a magnet.<li>The bears want the week to close below that high and below last week’s high.<li>They also want the week to close below the open of the week. This week would then have a bear body, which would increase the chance of sideways to down trading next week.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 2 points in the overnight Globex session. It should open near the middle of yesterday’s trading range. It therefore might continue sideways, as it has been doing for 4 days.<li>However, the Emini has been in a tight bull channel for 7 days on the 60-minute chart. A bull channel is a bear flag since there is a 75% chance of a break below the channel and then a swing sideways to down.<li>There have been swings up and down during most recent days. Traders are deciding if the rally will break strongly above the all-time high and reach the top of the weekly channel, or reverse down from a double top with the November 5 high.<li>In either case, there can be a strong trend. If there is a series of strong trend bars in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour in either direction, traders will look for a trend day.<li>But if there is hesitation and reversals, they will expect at least one swing up and one swing down today.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-outside-up-after-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-19.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up after sell climax.

The bears want a reversal down from a higher high double top, and the bulls want the rally to continue up to the top of the bull channel. Since the Emini is in a bull trend (with 7-bar bull micro channel on weekly chart), the odds slightly favor higher prices.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex is in an extreme sell climax in a support zone. This should attract some profit taking soon, which will likely result in a trading range for a couple months. The selloff might continue down to the June 19, 2020 higher low before the trading range begins.<h2 id=\"1-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Weekly-Bear-Follow-Through-Below-June-2020-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-21.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Weekly Chart Bear Follow Through below June 2020 High\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was the 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive big bear bar closing near its low.<li>The selloff is breaking below the support of the March 9, 2020 high. A breakout with consecutive big bear bars usually has at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down.<li>The breakout sometimes becomes a measuring gap, which would result in a test of last year’s low and the bottom of the 7-year trading range.<li>This week also broke below the bottom of the bear channel. A breakout below a bear channel has a 75% chance of failing within about 5 bars. Therefore, the selling should end by the end of the year.<li>The end of the selling does not mean the start of a bull trend. Since the selloff has been in a tight bear channel, a trading range for at least a couple months is likely.<li>If the bulls can stop the selling and create a trading range, they will have a better chance of beginning a swing up.<li>Al has been saying that the EURUSD would probably dip below the March 2020 and possibly the June 2020 breakout points before the 6-month bear trend could end.<li>However, there is no sign of a bottom yet. &nbsp;<li>The EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years. When there is a trading range, traders look for reversals. When a market is in a trading range and it gets near support or resistance, it usually goes beyond it before reversing, as it has done now.<li>The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago. There is no credible bottom yet, but a reversal up is likely before there is a breakout below the bottom of the 7-year range.<li>Since this week closed as a strong bear bar, odds are the EURUSD should trade at least slightly lower next week.<li>The bears want a strong break below the June 19, 2020 low and a continuation of the measured move down. They need several strong bear bars closing near their lows to convince traders that the move is underway.<li>Can next week be a big bull bar closing near its high? It is possible. It would then form a 2-bar reversal, and it would increase the odds that a reversal has started.<li>The bulls will need at least a strong bull reversal bar or consecutive bull bars closing near their highs before traders will begin looking for a reversal up.<li>There is always at least a 40% chance that the opposite of what is likely will happen. Consequently, there is at least a 40% chance that the selloff will continue down to near the bottom of the 7-year trading range.&nbsp;</ul><h3 id=\"3-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>Daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Daily-Trend-Channel-Line-Overshoot-Micro-Double-Bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-21-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Daily Chart Trend Channel Line Overshoot and Micro Double Bottom\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD had follow-through selling and broke below the bear channel early in the week. The pullback on Wednesday and Thursday tested the trend channel line, and the test led to a new 17-month low.<li>However, Friday had a prominent tail below.<li>The bears want the sell climax to continue. However, it is extreme, and it should begin to attract profit takers.&nbsp;<li>An extreme sell climax that has a brief reversal, like over Wednesday and Thursday, often has a 1- to 3-day final leg down before exhausted bears begin protracted profit taking.<li>Also, a break below a bear channel usually fails within about 5 bars.&nbsp;<li>There might be more buyers than sellers below Wednesday’s low. If so, the bear trend should convert into a trading range over the next couple of weeks.<li>Traders will likely decide over the next week if it’s time to take some profits.&nbsp;<li>A reasonable minimum goal when there is profit-taking is at least a couple of legs sideways to up and lasting about 10 days.<li>Since 2 legs are the minimum, traders will buy the first 1- to 3-day selloff after the 1<sup>st</sup>rally from the bottom.<li>The first target for a reversal up after a sell climax is the most recent lower high which is November 18 high. That is the neckline of the micro double bottom. The bulls want a measured move up. The bears will try to get another leg down from a double top with Thursday’s high.<li>If the rally is weak, the selloff will continue down to the June 19, 2020 low of 1.1168.<li>If the bulls get several bull bars closing near their highs, this reversal could be the start of a 1- to 2-month rally.<li>As strong as the 2021 bear trend has been, it is still only a bear leg in a 7-year trading range. Traders should expect a bull leg at some point.&nbsp;</ul><h2 id=\"4-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"5-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Monthly-Breakout-Above-Outside-Outside-Pattern-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-21-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart Breakout above Outside- Outside Pattern\"></a></figure><ul><li>The November monthly Emini candlestick currently is a bull bar at the all-time high. So far it is a strong breakout above the Sept-Oct OO (outside-outside) pattern.<li>The bulls want a test of the trend channel line around 4820 and a measured move to 4934.50 based on the height of the OO pattern (which is the height of the October bar).&nbsp;<li>September was the third time that a bear bar interrupted the strong rally on the monthly chart. A third reversal attempt has a higher probability of leading to a 2- to 3-bar sideways to down pullback.<li>Al has said that most prior bear bars in buy climaxes on the monthly chart led to a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar within a bar or two. That means the bears hope that November rallies and then reverses down at the end of the month to close below the open of the month. Therefore, the bears will try to create a bear bar in November. If they are successful, it will probably lead to lower prices in December.<li>Will that happen? With October being surprisingly strong, November will likely be another bull bar. Traders will begin to wonder if the Emini will reach the 5,000 Big Round Number before there is more than a one-month reversal.<li>How much higher can the buy climax continue? Climactic rallies often last far longer than what might appear reasonable.<li>An OO pattern is a pause and a brief area of agreement. It is usually an expanding triangle on a smaller time frame.&nbsp;<li>A breakout from a triangle usually tests back to the triangle, where the bulls and bears last agreed on a fair price.<li>Therefore, there is an increased chance that it will be the Final Bull Flag before there is a correction lasting at least a few bars (months).&nbsp;<li>However, the breakout above the OO often lasts several bars before there is a reversal.&nbsp;<li>For now, the odds slightly favor sideways to up in November.&nbsp;<li>However, there is always a bear case, and it always has at least a 40% chance of happening.&nbsp;<li>But even if it does, the best the bears will probably get is 2 to 3 months of sideways to down trading before the bulls try for another leg up.<li>There are 6 trading days left before November candlestick closes.&nbsp;<li>The bulls want a big bull bar closing near its high, which should lead to higher prices in December.<li>The bears want a close below the open of the month or at least a prominent tail above to reduce the bullishness. They would then have a better chance of sideways to down trading for a couple months.</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Weekly-Doji-Bar-7-Bar-Bull-Micro-Channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-21-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Doji Bar and 7-bar Bull Micro Channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick made a new high but closed as a bull doji bar. There is now a 7-bar bull micro channel, which means strong bulls.<li>The last 3 weekly bars are overlapping, which means the Emini is in a small trading range.<li>While there is a micro double top, a bull doji bar is a weak sell signal bar for a strong reversal down. This is especially true in a tight 7-bar bull microchannel, which represents relentless aggressive buying.<li>The bears want a higher high major trend reversal with the September high. The bears would need a surprisingly strong bear bar or series of bear bars closing near its low before traders would look for a reversal.<li>Al has said that there is a<a href=\"https://admiralmarkets.com/education/articles/forex-strategy/seasonal-patterns-of-financial-markets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">seasonal strong tendency to rally</a>from November 11 to December 5. Although it is difficult to construct a profitable strategy using calendar tendencies, they are factors to consider. Traders looking for a big selloff in a bull trend during a seasonally bullish time need very strong bear bars before shorting.<li>The next target for the bulls is the top of the bull channel at 4775. Above that is the measured move target at 4802.00 based on the height of the 4-month trading range (Jul-Oct).<li>So far, the Small Pullback Bull Trend is still intact. A Small Pullback Bull Trend ends with a big pullback. That means a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than the biggest prior pullback. Here, the strong bull trend will remain intact until there is at least a 15% correction.&nbsp;<li>Once it ends, the bull trend typically converts into a trading range. Initially, the odds are that it will be a bull flag. Traders should expect the trend to resume. If it does, it is usually a weaker bull trend.<li>If the trading range lasts 20 or more bars, the probability of a reversal into a bear trend begins to approach 50%.<li>For now, the odds slightly favor sideways to up for November unless the bears can create consecutive strong bear bars closing near its low.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Daily-Weak-Re-test-of-High-Higher-High-Double-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-21-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Daily Chart Weak Re-test of High and Higher High Double Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini tested the November 5 high this week.<li>There have been 3 small pushes up over the past 6 days.

A bear trend can begin at any time.<li>Is this the high of the year? It might be, but there have been many other attempts at a bear trend reversal, and all have failed.

It is a double top sell signal bar for today for a higher high major trend reversal.<li>Last week’s range was small. This week might become an outside down bar on the weekly chart.<li>If the month closes below the open of the month, there will be a bear bar on the monthly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices in December.<li>However, the daily chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since the October 13 low. There have been many reversal attempts and all were minor. This reduces the chance that the reversal will be major.<li>If today is a bull inside day, it will be a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<li>If today is another bear bar closing near its low, it would increase the chance that the selloff will continue down to the open of the month by the time the month closes next week.<li>If today is not a strong bull day, the selloff should continue down to the November 10 low, even if there is a bounce first. The bulls will try to get a reversal up from a double bottom bull flag with that low.<li>More likely, the Emini will be sideways to down for at least a couple weeks.<li>Today is a good candidate for the high of the year. But the bears will need several big bear bars before traders will believe that this selloff will grow into a bear trend.<li>A market often pulls back just before a candlestick closes. On the yearly chart (not shown), the Emini might pull back into the end of the year, which would put a conspicuous tail on top of the bar. That would make this year’s bar less bullish.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 1 point in the overnight Globex session on the daily chart.<li>Yesterday had 2 strong selloffs and closed near the low. It was a sell climax day.<li>The bears want a gap down today and then a strong bear trend. If there are early bear bars closing near their lows, whether or not there is a gap down, there will be an increased chance of a bear trend day today.<li>However, when there is a sell climax into the close, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour. That reduces the chance of a Bear Trend From The Open today.<li>The bulls want a reversal up. But the selloff was a Major Bear Surprise. It will probably affect the next several days. Traders will look to sell the first strong rally, even if it lasts for a couple days. There is at least a 50% chance that the Emini will work down to the November 10 low.<li>However, a strong bull trend day today would erase much of yesterday’s bearishness. Today would then be a High 1 buy signal bar for tomorrow.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-parablice-wedge-top-and-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-23.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge top and outside down day, and double top sell signal.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Forex-lower-low-double-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-23-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex lower low double bottom\"></a></figure><ul><li>Last week had consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows. Also, the 2 bars were a breakout (below a bear channel). Traders expected at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down. The past 3 days met the minimum expectation.<li>However, a breakout below a bear channel typically begins to reverse up within about 5 days. Today is the 7<sup>th</sup>day and so far has a small bull body.<li>The bigger the body today and the more today closes on its high, the more traders will buy tomorrow, hoping for a reversal up. If today is the low, the 1<sup>st</sup>target will be the November 18 lower high.<li>With the sell climax as extreme as it has been, there should be a rally lasting at least a couple weeks and having at least a couple legs beginning soon. The selloff is extreme on the weekly chart as well.<li>A reversal could lead to a trading range that lasts a couple months.<li>The selloff is near the June 19, 2020 higher low, which is a magnet below. If there is going to be a reversal up for a few weeks, many traders would like it to come after testing that support.<li>The momentum down is strong so traders expect lower prices.<li>But the selloff has been extreme. It is therefore climactic, and it is in a zone of support. This increases the chance of a reversal up for at least a couple weeks beginning soon.<li>We are near the end of the year. Major currency reversals have an increased chance of coming at the start of a year. Therefore, the EURUSD might continue sideways to down through December.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-buy-climax-and-then-nested-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax and then nested wedge bottom\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>After a test of the open of the week in the first 10 minutes, the Emini rallied strongly to the EMA. The rally was a Major Bull Surprise, which made a bear trend day unlikely.<li>It was a buy climax and bears sold it.<li>After new low, the Emini reversed up from a nested wedge bottom and entered a trading range.<li>Closed a little above the open of the day so today was a bull doji on the daily chart.<li>Because today was not a big bull day closing on its high, it is not a strong buy signal bar on the daily chart. This is especially true after yesterday was a big bear outside down day.<li>The Emini is still in the middle of its 7-day range.<li>The bulls want the week to close above the open so that this week will be a bull bar on the weekly chart.<li>The bears want a bear bar on the weekly chart. They also want a bear bar on the monthly chart when November closes next Tuesday. That would increase the chance of lower prices in December.<li>Sideways for 7 days increases the chance of more sideways tomorrow.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bears want November to be a bear bar on the monthly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices in December. The bulls need bull bars on the daily chart this week if the year is going to close at a new high.<p>The&nbsp;<strong>EURUSD&nbsp;</strong>Forex is reversing higher after a test of the June 19, 2020 low and a break far below the bear channels on the daily and weekly charts. This week’s bull reversal bar on the weekly chart is a strong bull signal bar for next week. If the bulls get strong follow-through next week, it could lead to a 2-legged sideways to up move and a transition into a trading range for a couple months.<h2 id=\"2-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"3-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Weekly-Bull-Reversal-Bar-After-TCL-Overshoot.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-28.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Weekly Chart Bull Reversal Bar after TCL Overshoot\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a bull reversal bar closing just slightly off its high with a long tail below after testing to just above the June 19, 2020 low.<li>Al has been saying that the EURUSD has been in a support zone for a few weeks and that it will likely reverse up for at least a few weeks. Most likely, it will form a trading range for at least a couple of months.&nbsp;<li>This week’s bull reversal bar is a good buy signal bar for next week, especially since it is reversing up from a breakout below a bear channel. A breakout below a bear channel has a 75% chance of failing within about 5 bars. This is a good candidate for a reversal back up toward the middle of the channel. It can get there by going sideways or up.<li>The bulls will need strong follow-through buying over the next 1- to 2-weeks. If they get that, it will lead to a 2-legged sideways to up move that typically lasts around 10 or more bars. On the weekly chart, that is at least a couple months.<li>If those legs are strong, there could be a rally back to the October 28 high, which was the start of the most recent sell climax and therefore a magnet.&nbsp;<li>If the reversal is more sideways, there could be a new low. The bears are hoping that this rally will quickly form a bear flag and then resume the yearlong bear trend.<li>However, with the chart in a 7-year trading range, traders still expect a couple of months of sideways to up trading to begin soon.&nbsp;Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago. A reversal up is likely before there is a breakout below the bottom of the 7-year range.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Daily-Reversal-Up-Parabolic-Wedge-Sell-Climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-28-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily Chart Reversal Up from Parabolic Wedge Sell Climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD traded lower by Wednesday but reversed up from a 7-day parabolic wedge sell climax on Friday.&nbsp;<li>Al said that the recent selloff to below the bear channel was extreme. There is often a final plunge to a wedge bottom, like here, and then the exhausted bears begin protracted profit-taking.<li>A common minimum expectation is TBTL… Ten Bars and Two Legs. As I wrote above, this week could be the start of a trading range over the next couple months.<li>The bears are hoping that this rally will quickly form a bear flag and continue the yearlong bear trend.<li>Because the EURUSD reversed up strongly on Friday from a failed breakout below a bear channel, traders should expect at least a couple of legs sideways to up on the daily chart.&nbsp;<li>Since 2 legs are the minimum, traders will buy the first 1- to 3-day selloff after the 1<sup>st</sup>rally from the bottom.<li>The first target for a reversal up after a sell climax is the most recent lower high which is November 18 high. The bulls want a measured move up above that high. The bears will try to get another leg down from a double top with November 18 high. If those legs up are strong, there could be a rally back to the October 28 high.&nbsp;<li>If the reversal is more sideways, there could be a new low. However, with the chart in a 7-year trading range, traders still expect a couple of months of sideways to up trading to begin soon.&nbsp;</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Monthly-Bear-Doji-With-Long-Tail-Above.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-28-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart Bear Doji with Long Tail Above\"></a></figure><ul><li>The November monthly Emini candlestick currently is a bear doji with a long tail above. The breakout above the Sept-Oct OO (outside-outside) pattern seems to be failing.<li>There are 2 more trading days before the monthly candlestick closes. The bears want to extend the bear body by closing below Oct or Aug-Sept highs, and they want the bar to close near its low. That would probably lead to lower prices in December.<li>The bulls want the Emini to reverse back up on Monday and Tuesday to close at least above the middle of the bar at around 4660. The more bullish the bar, the more likely December will be higher and the year will close on the high.<li>Al said that when October formed a big bear bar, that there should be a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar within 2 months. Sometimes it comes in the 3<sup>rd</sup>month. The Emini is back to the open of the month, and November might become that 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar.<li>If the bears get a bear bar, especially one with a reasonably big bear body and closes near its low, November will be a good sell signal bar on the monthly chart. Traders will look for a reversal down from a failed OO buy signal.<li>Remember, September and October were consecutive outside bars, which created an OO Breakout Mode pattern. The buy triggered when November traded above the October high. If November forms a good bear reversal bar, it would be a reasonable sell signal bar for a failed OO buy signal. That would increase the chance of December trading down.<li>Al mentioned that the year opened on its low and it is now at its high. On the yearly chart (Al will show the chart in early January), 2021 is a big bull bar that is currently closing on its high.<li>Most big bull bars have conspicuous tails on top (in this case, 1 bar on the yearly chart is 1 year). It usually comes from a pullback just before the bar closes. That is why he said that there was an increased chance of a reversal in December. Bars often change their appearance just before they close, and what happens in December is just before the 2021 bar closes on the yearly chart.<li>The computers know this tendency. Bull computers will try to overwhelm the bear computers and get the year to close on its high. That could even lead to a gap up in January, which would create a gap up on the daily, monthly and yearly charts. With the final trading day of 2021 being a Friday, there would also be a gap up on the weekly chart.<li>Therefore, there is an increased chance of a big move in either direction in December.<li>If the year closes on its high, there will be an increased chance of higher prices early next year.<li>But if December is a bear bar closing near its low on the monthly chart, the new year will probably trade down.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Weekly-Big-Bear-Bar-After-Double-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-28-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Big Bear Bar after Double Top at Top of Bull Channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was an outside bear bar with a small tail below, reversing lower from a higher high double top near the top of the bull channel.<li>The candlestick after an outside bar often is an inside bar or has a lot of overlap with the outside bar. If it is an inside bar, it would form an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is a breakout mode.<li>Since this week is a bear bar closing near its low, it is a sell signal bar for next week. The bears need to create follow-through selling next week to increase the odds for a deeper pullback.&nbsp;<li>Is this the start of a correction? The Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. If there is follow-through selling early next week, this will be another one of those times.<li>The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs like in September push the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>If the bulls get a strong reversal up next week, the probability of a new high by the end of the year will be again back to 60%.<li>Next week should give traders an idea of what will happen in December.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-Daily-Pullback-After-Higher-High-Double-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-28-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart Pullback after Higher High Double Top\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini made a new high on Monday but Monday reversed to close as an outside bear reversal bar closing near the low.

That was the breakout point for the October rally, and with all of the trading range trading in August and September, a strong selloff should continue at least to a little below the breakout point. That would also be about a 50% pullback from the rally up from the October 4 low.<li>The bears want a measured move down and then continued selling down to the October low.<li>If they were to get that, there would probably be a bounce from that support.

There would still be a 60% chance of the Emini continuing sideways or resuming up after a head and shoulders top.<li>The bulls are hoping Friday is just a bear trap in a strong bull trend.

They will need a bull bar closing near its high today or tomorrow to convince traders that the Emini will make a new high before the end of the year.</ul><h4>End of the month and end of the year</h4><ul><li>Tuesday is the final trading day in November. When October formed a big bear bar, I said that there should be a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive bear bar within 2 months. The Emini is back to the open of the month, and November might become that 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar.<li>If the bears get a bear bar, especially one with a reasonably big bear body and close near its low, November will be a good sell signal bar on the monthly chart. Traders will look for a reversal down from a failed OO buy signal.<li>Remember, September and October were consecutive outside bars, which created an OO Breakout Mode pattern. The buy triggered when November traded above the October high. If November forms a good bear reversal bar, it would be a reasonable sell signal bar for a failed OO buy signal. That would increase the chance of December trading down.<li>I said that a bar often reverses right before it closes and tests some significant price. On the monthly chart, Friday tested the open of the month.<li>It is important to understand that the test could lead to a sharp reversal. Therefore, traders should not be surprised if November rallies sharply over the next 2 days and closes back near its high, despite the big selloff and only having 2 days remaining in the month.<li>I want to make a point about the yearly chart, which I will post in early January. The year opened on its low and it is now at its high.<li>Most big bull bars have conspicuous tails on top. It usually comes from a pullback just before the bar closes.<li>That is why I have said several times in November that there was an increased chance of a reversal in December. Bars often change their appearance just before they close, and what happens in December is just before the 2021 bar closes on the yearly chart.<li>The computers know this tendency. The bull computers will try to overwhelm the bear computers and get the year to close on its high. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a big move in either direction in December.<li>If the year closes on its high, there will be an increased chance of higher prices early next year.<li>But if December is a bear bar closing near its low on the monthly chart, the new year will probably trade down.<li>Is this the start of a correction? I have said many times that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. If there is follow-through selling early this week, this will be another one of those times.<li>I have also said that the probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs like in September push the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>If the bulls get a strong reversal up this week, the probability of a new high by the end of the year will be again back to 60%.<li>The next few days should give traders an idea of what will happen in December.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 38 points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap above Friday’s high.<li>Whether or not today gaps up, if it opens near the high of a big bear day, there is an increased chance of an early low of the day and then a big bull day.<li>While it is possible that today will be another big bear day, it is less likely now that it is opening near Friday’s high.<li>If today closes below its midpoint, it will be a reasonable follow-through day after Friday’s collapse. It will be a Low 1 sell signal bar on the daily chart.<li>If it is a big bull day, the Emini will probably rally in December, and the year still might close at a new high.<li>With Friday being mostly sideways, the Emini could get stuck in Friday’s range and oscillate around the open of the month, and then wait for tomorrow when November ends to decide if November will have a bear bar on the monthly chart. Friday would then simply have been a test of the open of the month.<li>If today is a sideways day, the open of the day could be a magnet at the end of the day. If there is a bull body, the bigger it is, the more likely tomorrow will trade high.<li>If today is a big bull day closing near its high, the Emini might rally strongly through the end of the year.<li>What about omicron? Mostly irrelevant. The selloff started a week before it made the news. The selloff was technical. It was simply a test of the open of the month, and it would have happened with or without omicron. Omicron was the excuse for the market to do what it was going to do.<li>If not omicron, then something else would have been the excuse… inflation, China, Russia… you pick.</ul><h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Forex-possible-reversal-up-from-sell-climax-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-29.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex possible reversal up from sell climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>Today so far is a bear inside day.<li>Friday reversed up from a parabolic wedge sell climax over the past 7 bars on the daily chart.<li>I have been saying that the EURUSD has been in a support zone for a few weeks and that it will probably reverse up for at least a few weeks. Most likely, it will form a trading range for at least a couple months, and last week could be the start of the transition from a strong bear trend into a trading range.<li>The bulls formed a reversal bar on the<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Weekly-Bull-Reversal-Bar-After-TCL-Overshoot.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">weekly chart</a>, which was a test of the June 19, 2020 low. That was the 1<sup>st</sup>pullback from the breakout of the spring triangle and the bottom of the support zone that I have discussed many times over the past several months.<li>The bears are hoping that this rally will quickly form a bear flag and continue the yearlong bear trend. If today is a bear bar closing below its midpoint, it will be a sell signal bar for a lower high double top with the November 18 high. Friday would be a bear trap.<li>Because last week reversed up strongly on Friday from a failed breakout below a bear channel on the daily and weekly charts, traders should expect at least a couple legs sideways to up on the daily chart.<li>If those legs are strong, there could be a rally back to the October 28 high.<li>If the reversal is more sideways, there could be a new low. However, with the chart in a 7-year treading range, traders still expect a couple months of sideways to up trading to begin soon.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-endless-pullback.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-29-1.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then endless pullback\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>After 2-legged pullback to the EMA and yesterday’s trading range high, the Emini rallied in a tight bull channel (Small Pullback Bull Trend) to just above the 60-minute EMA.<li>The high of the day was a measured move up from the low to the open. The low is always important. When a rally stops at a measured move that is based on the open, then the open is also important and a magnet later in the day. That often leads to a test of the open late in the day.<li>Friday was a test of the open of the month and today rallied strongly. That increases the chance that November will close above the open of the month and have a bull body. Traders will expect higher prices in December.<li>On the daily chart, today had a small bull body. It opened around Friday’s open, and Friday was a big bear day.<li>That combination usually means there are lots of trapped bears. It often leads to a swing up, like on June 21, July 20, and October 28 of this year and March 24, 2020.<li>This increases the chance of a rally into the end of the year. The odds would be better if today was a big bull day. The odds will go up more if tomorrow is another bull day.<li>The bears are still hoping for November to have a bear body on the monthly chart. But with the Emini now about 50 points above the open of the month and tomorrow being the final day of the month, November will probably be a bull bar.<li>While unlikely, if tomorrow collapsed and November finished with a bear body, December would probably trade down.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Emini may form a monthly chart bear bar for November.<li>While Friday closed well below that support, there was a conspicuous tail below. The bears will need strong follow-through early this week before traders will conclude that this is the start of a move down to the October low.<li>The selloff was strong enough for traders to expect at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>The Emini will probably dip below the September 2 high before the bulls can get a new high. That was the breakout point for the October rally, and with all of the trading range trading in August and September, a strong selloff should continue at least to a little below the breakout point. That would also be about a 50% pullback from the rally up from the October 4 low.<li>The bears want a measured move down, and then continued selling down to the October low.<li>If they were to get that, there would probably be a bounce from that support. If there was then another reversal down from a lower high, there would be a head and shoulders top. September 2 would be the left shoulder and November 22 would be the head.<li>A major sell signal has a 40% chance of leading to a major trend reversal (here, into a bear trend). There would still be a 60% chance of the Emini continuing sideways or resuming up.<li>The bulls are hoping Friday is just a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg bear trap in a strong bull trend. They will need a bull bar closing near its high today or tomorrow to convince traders that the Emini will make a new high before the end of the year.</ul><h4>End of the month and end of the year</h4><ul><li>Tuesday is the final trading day in November. When October formed a big bear bar, I said that there should be a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive bear bar within 2 months. The Emini is back to the open of the month, and November might become that 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar.<li>If the bears get a bear bar, especially one with a reasonably big bear body and close near its low, November will be a good sell signal bar on the monthly chart. Traders will look for a reversal down from a failed OO buy signal.<li>Remember, September and October were consecutive outside bars, which created an OO Breakout Mode pattern. The buy triggered when November traded above the October high. If November forms a good bear reversal bar, it would be a reasonable sell signal bar for a failed OO buy signal. That would increase the chance of December trading down.<li>I said that a bar often reverses right before it closes and tests some significant price. On the monthly chart, Friday tested the open of the month.<li>It is important to understand that the test could lead to a sharp reversal. Therefore, traders should not be surprised if November rallies sharply over the next 2 days and closes back near its high, despite the big selloff and only having 2 days remaining in the month.<li>I want to make a point about the yearly chart, which I will post in early January. The year opened on its low and it is now at its high.<li>Most big bull bars have conspicuous tails on top. It usually comes from a pullback just before the bar closes.<li>That is why I have said several times in November that there was an increased chance of a reversal in December. Bars often change their appearance just before they close, and what happens in December is just before the 2021 bar closes on the yearly chart.<li>The computers know this tendency. The bull computers will try to overwhelm the bear computers and get the year to close on its high. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a big move in either direction in December.<li>If the year closes on its high, there will be an increased chance of higher prices early next year.<li>But if December is a bear bar closing near its low on the monthly chart, the new year will probably trade down.<li>Is this the start of a correction? I have said many times that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. If there is follow-through selling early this week, this will be another one of those times.<li>I have also said that the probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs like in September push the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>If the bulls get a strong reversal up this week, the probability of a new high by the end of the year will be again back to 60%.<li>The next few days should give traders an idea of what will happen in December.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 38 points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap above Friday’s high.<li>Whether or not today gaps up, if it opens near the high of a big bear day, there is an increased chance of an early low of the day and then a big bull day.<li>While it is possible that today will be another big bear day, it is less likely now that it is opening near Friday’s high.<li>If today closes below its midpoint, it will be a reasonable follow-through day after Friday’s collapse. It will be a Low 1 sell signal bar on the daily chart.<li>If it is a big bull day, the Emini will probably rally in December, and the year still might close at a new high.<li>With Friday being mostly sideways, the Emini could get stuck in Friday’s range and oscillate around the open of the month, and then wait for tomorrow when November ends to decide if November will have a bear bar on the monthly chart. Friday would then simply have been a test of the open of the month.<li>If today is a sideways day, the open of the day could be a magnet at the end of the day. If there is a bull body, the bigger it is, the more likely tomorrow will trade high.<li>If today is a big bull day closing near its high, the Emini might rally strongly through the end of the year.<li>What about omicron? Mostly irrelevant. The selloff started a week before it made the news. The selloff was technical. It was simply a test of the open of the month, and it would have happened with or without omicron. Omicron was the excuse for the market to do what it was going to do.<li>If not omicron, then something else would have been the excuse… inflation, China, Russia… you pick.</ul><h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Forex-possible-reversal-up-from-sell-climax-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-29.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex possible reversal up from sell climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>Today so far is a bear inside day.<li>Friday reversed up from a parabolic wedge sell climax over the past 7 bars on the daily chart.<li>I have been saying that the EURUSD has been in a support zone for a few weeks and that it will probably reverse up for at least a few weeks. Most likely, it will form a trading range for at least a couple months, and last week could be the start of the transition from a strong bear trend into a trading range.<li>The bulls formed a reversal bar on the<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EURUSD-Weekly-Bull-Reversal-Bar-After-TCL-Overshoot.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">weekly chart</a>, which was a test of the June 19, 2020 low. That was the 1<sup>st</sup>pullback from the breakout of the spring triangle and the bottom of the support zone that I have discussed many times over the past several months.<li>The bears are hoping that this rally will quickly form a bear flag and continue the yearlong bear trend. If today is a bear bar closing below its midpoint, it will be a sell signal bar for a lower high double top with the November 18 high. Friday would be a bear trap.<li>Because last week reversed up strongly on Friday from a failed breakout below a bear channel on the daily and weekly charts, traders should expect at least a couple legs sideways to up on the daily chart.<li>If those legs are strong, there could be a rally back to the October 28 high.<li>If the reversal is more sideways, there could be a new low. However, with the chart in a 7-year treading range, traders still expect a couple months of sideways to up trading to begin soon.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-endless-pullback.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-11-29-1.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then endless pullback\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>After 2-legged pullback to the EMA and yesterday’s trading range high, the Emini rallied in a tight bull channel (Small Pullback Bull Trend) to just above the 60-minute EMA.<li>The high of the day was a measured move up from the low to the open. The low is always important. When a rally stops at a measured move that is based on the open, then the open is also important and a magnet later in the day. That often leads to a test of the open late in the day.<li>Friday was a test of the open of the month and today rallied strongly. That increases the chance that November will close above the open of the month and have a bull body. Traders will expect higher prices in December.<li>On the daily chart, today had a small bull body. It opened around Friday’s open, and Friday was a big bear day.<li>That combination usually means there are lots of trapped bears. It often leads to a swing up, like on June 21, July 20, and October 28 of this year and March 24, 2020.<li>This increases the chance of a rally into the end of the year. The odds would be better if today was a big bull day. The odds will go up more if tomorrow is another bull day.<li>The bears are still hoping for November to have a bear body on the monthly chart. But with the Emini now about 50 points above the open of the month and tomorrow being the final day of the month, November will probably be a bull bar.<li>While unlikely, if tomorrow collapsed and November finished with a bear body, December would probably trade down.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
