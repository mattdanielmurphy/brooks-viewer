There would then be another ioi, like in October, and traders will look for another leg up in March.<p>The bears want February to trade below the January low. That would trigger a minor sell signal. Traders would then look for a month or two of lower prices.<p>Last week formed an outside down week on the weekly chart, and the week closed below the week before. Also, the Emini broke below the 3-month bull channel on the daily chart. Most importantly, January had a bear body on the monthly chart. These factors increase the chances of sideways to down trading this week. Look back at the past 2 years. There was a selloff in February. Traders are wondering if this will be 3 in a row.<p>If this is the start of a pullback, the 1st target is the bottom of the December trading range, just above 3600. Below that is the November 10 low at 3500, which was the start of the bull channel.<p>Since the daily chart is now in a trading range, the selloff will probably bounce along the way down. That means the Emini could go sideways for a week or more as it works lower.<p>There is a 50% chance that the selloff will end around 3600. However, the bulls need consecutive strong bull bars, to flip the probability back in favor of a continuation up to a new high without first testing support.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini sold off overnight, but it reversed up. It is now up 34 points in the Globex session. It will open relatively far above Friday’s close and in the middle of Friday’s range.<p>Friday had a sell climax and a reversal up. The bulls want the reversal up to continue this week and undo Friday’s damage. Because the daily, weekly, and monthly charts are in a bull trend, there is an increased chance that last week’s selloff will fail. That means there is an increased chance of a bull trend day today. Can today be another big bear day? Yes, and if it is, traders will expect a move down below 3600 this week.<p>What is most likely? Most days have a lot of trading range trading. That is especially true after a sell climax day, like Friday. Traders will watch the open. If most of the bars have prominent tails and lot of reversals, traders will expect a trading range open and a trading range day.<p>But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, they will look for a trend. Even if there is a strong trend, traders know that many strong trends over the past few weeks had midday reversals. If there is a trend, traders will be ready for one again today.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Emini-wedge-rally-to-double-top-then-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-1.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge rally to double top then bear trend after 3-month bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-top-and-triangle-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-1-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is turning down from the January 22 lower high. The bears hope that the lower high will be the 1st in a series of lower highs, and the start of a bear trend. They see that lower high as the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top, and a lower high major trend reversal. If they get a couple closes below the January 1 low, which is the neckline, traders will look for a measured move down to the November 4 low of 1.6.<p>Most tops and bottoms are trading ranges, which mean they are Breakout Mode pattern. This is another example. Every trading range also has a credible buy pattern. Traders see the head and shoulders top as a triangle bull flag. The bulls need a strong break above the January 22 lower high and then a couple closes above the January 6 high, before traders will conclude that the bull trend is resuming.<p>What is most likely? Trading ranges resist change. Until there is a convincing breakout up or down, traders will continue to look for reversals. Even though at the moment the bears have slightly higher probability of a successful bear breakout, until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. The odds of a reversal are always higher than of a successful breakout.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off sharply over night, but it has been sideways in a tight range for 2 hours. Day traders have only been making money selling. However, now that the range is so tight, even scalpers are having a hard time making even 10 pips.<p>Because there is a trading range and the EURUSD is near the support of the bottom of its 2-month trading range, the bulls are willing to buy. But the bears will continue to sell rallies, hoping for a resumption of the bear trend.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. Many traders are trading reversals, hoping for a surprisingly strong move up or down. However, they have been scalping out when they quickly become disappointed by the lack of a strong breakout.<p>Can today have either a strong bear breakout below the 2-month range, or a strong reversal up? A tight trading range after a sell climax usually will lead either to at least a small resumption down, or a small reversal up. A relative small move on the 5-minute chart today is more likely than a big trend, especially since the EURUSD has been sideways for 3 weeks with mostly small days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It rallied from a higher low double bottom at the EMA and formed a Spike and Channel Bull Trend. The rally continued to above yesterday’s high, where it stalled. It pulled back into the close.<p>Today is a buy signal bar on the daily chart for a 2-bar reversal and a High 2 bull flag. But yesterday has a big tail on top. Also, the Emini has been in a trading range since early January, and traders are taking quick profits every few days. That reduces the chance that today is a resumption of the bull trend.<p>Instead, the rally might stall at Thursday’s lower high. If the bulls break strongly above that high, traders will conclude that the correction is over and that the bull trend is resuming.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

If the bulls break strongly above that high, traders will conclude that the correction is over and that the bull trend is resuming.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is a High 2 buy signal bar for today on the daily chart. But it has a prominent tail on top, and the Emini has been in the January trading range. This is a low probability buy setup.<p>There are bull trends on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. However, all 3 time frames have an increased chance of being in a 10% pullback,<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-minor-sell-signal-bar/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"as I discussed over the weekend (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">as I discussed over the weekend</a>. Therefore, a reversal up from here might be just a bounce in a bear channel.<p>With the daily chart sideways for 5 weeks, traders are looking for reversals every few days. When the chart is unclear, traders tend to buy low, sell high, use wide stops, scale in, and take quick profits. The result is a trading range. That is what has been going on all year so far.<p>Thursday’s minor lower high is a magnet above. The Emini might have to test it this week. If the bulls break strongly above it, traders will conclude that the selloff has ended.<p>But if the Emini reverses down from there, traders will see yesterday’s rally as a failed test of Thursday’s high. There would then be a double top lower high, which would give the bears another chance to test down to 3500 in February.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 34 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up and open around 3800. The Emini has been oscillating around the 3800 Big Round Number all year, and therefore traders see it as important.<p>Yesterday’s rally was extreme and therefore a buy climax. While the bulls want a 2nd consecutive big bull day, the day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of trading sideways to down for a couple hours starting by the end of the 2nd hour. If today is a bull trend day, it will probably be a weaker type of trend, like a broad bull channel, or a trending trading range day.<p>Each of the past 4 days was a big reversal day, and the bears want the Emini to reverse down today. Because it is breaking far above the 60-minute EMA, and Thursday’s high is a strong magnet above, today will probably not be a big bear trend day.<p>Traders should expect several hours of trading range trading today. At a minimum, there should be at least one swing up and one swing down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend and then into January trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-testing-neckline-of-head-and-shoulders-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-2-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex testing neckline of head and shoulders top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is at the bottom of a 2-month trading range. Traders are looking for a breakout below or above, and then a 300-pip measured move.<p>Every trading range has both a buy and a sell signal. The bulls see a triangle bull flag since the January 6 high. The bears see a head and shoulders top, which is also a lower high major trend reversal.<p>The EURUSD has been testing the bottom of the range for 3 weeks. Today’s low so far is only a couple pips above the January low, which is the bottom of the range. Therefore, the EURUSD might break below it today.<p>But the bears need more than a break below the range. Traders want to see consecutive closes below the range before they conclude that the breakout is probably going to be successful.<h3>Sell signal on the monthly chart</h3><p>There is a<a aria-label=\"sell signal on the monthly chart (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-minor-sell-signal-bar/#5-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-a-sell-signal-bar-after-wedge-rally-to-top-of-a-6-year-trading-range\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">sell signal on the monthly chart</a>(not shown today), which will trigger if the EURUSD falls below last month’s low (the January 1 low). Since January had a bear body on the monthly chart and there is a wedge rally to a double top on the monthly chart, traders want to see if there are many sellers below last month’s low. That means that the EURUSD should at least dip below the January 1 low. It might do it today.<p>Remember, last month’s low is the bottom of the 2-month trading range on the daily chart, and the neckline of the head and shoulders top. The pattern on the monthly chart makes it more likely than not that the EURUSD will continue down.<p>As I wrote over the weekend, the next target is the September 1 high, which was the breakout point for the December rally. A more important target on the monthly chart is the November low of 1.1603. That is the bottom of the most recent leg up, which is always a target when there is a reversal down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to below yesterday’s low. It got to within 2 pips of the January 1 low and then stalled. There is a 50% chance that today will break below that low.<p>At a minimum, the bears want a bear body today after yesterday’s big bear day on the daily chart. If the bears get a bear follow-through bar today, it would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices tomorrow.<p>But the bears want more. They would like today to be a big bear trend day closing on its low, and closing far below the January 1 low at the bottom of the trading range. Because of the bounce from just above that low and the unremarkable range today, the bears will probably not get all that they want. But they will try to have today close below the open of the day.<p>The bulls hope that the selloff is just a test of support. But they need a strong reversal up over the next few days to convince traders that the bull trend on the daily chart is resuming.<p>So far, today is a bear trending trading range day. That reduces the chance of a big move in either direction from here. However, the bears will sell rallies, and try to get today to close on its low, and at least below the open. And the bulls will buy reversals up, hoping for a reversal day and a close above the open.<p>Unless there is a series of trend bars from here in either direction, traders will assume that the 2-hour trading range will continue. That means they will be scalping until there is a clear breakout.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range-and-late-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trading range and late trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That most often evolves into a trading range, which happened today. The rally broke above last Thursday’s minor lower high, but the bears will still try to get a reversal down from below the all-time high.<p>The Emini has been in a trading range for a month. That is a Breakout Mode situation. The range is 200 points tall. A bear breakout and measured move down would test the November 10 low, which was the start of the 3-month bull channel, and it is a magnet.<p>Because the Emini is in a trading range, traders are buying selloffs and selling rallies. After a 2-day rally, there is an increased chance of a selloff for at least a day or two, especially with the reversal down at the end of the day.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

At a minimum, there should be at least one swing up and one swing down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend and then into January trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders are looking for a breakout below or above, and then a 300-pip measured move.<p>Every trading range has both a buy and a sell signal. The bulls see a triangle bull flag since the January 6 high. The bears see a head and shoulders top, which is also a lower high major trend reversal.<p>The EURUSD has been testing the bottom of the range for 3 weeks. Today’s low so far is only a couple pips above the January low, which is the bottom of the range. Therefore, the EURUSD might break below it today.<p>But the bears need more than a break below the range. Traders want to see consecutive closes below the range before they conclude that the breakout is probably going to be successful.<h3>Sell signal on the monthly chart</h3><p>There is a<a aria-label=\"sell signal on the monthly chart (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-minor-sell-signal-bar/#5-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-a-sell-signal-bar-after-wedge-rally-to-top-of-a-6-year-trading-range\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">sell signal on the monthly chart</a>(not shown today), which will trigger if the EURUSD falls below last month’s low (the January 1 low). Since January had a bear body on the monthly chart and there is a wedge rally to a double top on the monthly chart, traders want to see if there are many sellers below last month’s low. That means that the EURUSD should at least dip below the January 1 low. It might do it today.<p>Remember, last month’s low is the bottom of the 2-month trading range on the daily chart, and the neckline of the head and shoulders top. The pattern on the monthly chart makes it more likely than not that the EURUSD will continue down.<p>As I wrote over the weekend, the next target is the September 1 high, which was the breakout point for the December rally. A more important target on the monthly chart is the November low of 1.1603. That is the bottom of the most recent leg up, which is always a target when there is a reversal down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to below yesterday’s low. It got to within 2 pips of the January 1 low and then stalled. There is a 50% chance that today will break below that low.<p>At a minimum, the bears want a bear body today after yesterday’s big bear day on the daily chart. If the bears get a bear follow-through bar today, it would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices tomorrow.<p>But the bears want more. They would like today to be a big bear trend day closing on its low, and closing far below the January 1 low at the bottom of the trading range. Because of the bounce from just above that low and the unremarkable range today, the bears will probably not get all that they want. But they will try to have today close below the open of the day.<p>The bulls hope that the selloff is just a test of support. But they need a strong reversal up over the next few days to convince traders that the bull trend on the daily chart is resuming.<p>So far, today is a bear trending trading range day. That reduces the chance of a big move in either direction from here. However, the bears will sell rallies, and try to get today to close on its low, and at least below the open. And the bulls will buy reversals up, hoping for a reversal day and a close above the open.<p>Unless there is a series of trend bars from here in either direction, traders will assume that the 2-hour trading range will continue. That means they will be scalping until there is a clear breakout.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range-and-late-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trading range and late trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That most often evolves into a trading range, which happened today. The rally broke above last Thursday’s minor lower high, but the bears will still try to get a reversal down from below the all-time high.<p>The Emini has been in a trading range for a month. That is a Breakout Mode situation. The range is 200 points tall. A bear breakout and measured move down would test the November 10 low, which was the start of the 3-month bull channel, and it is a magnet.<p>Because the Emini is in a trading range, traders are buying selloffs and selling rallies. After a 2-day rally, there is an increased chance of a selloff for at least a day or two, especially with the reversal down at the end of the day.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders are buying selloffs and selling rallies. The bulls reversed the market up after 2 big selloffs over the past 5 days. They want a new all-time high. But after a big 2-day rally, there is an increased chance of a selloff for a day or two.<p>The bears are hoping that the rally will fail at the top of the January trading range. They want a reversal down, and for the Emini to break below the trading range, and fall for a 200-point measured move. That would be a test of the November 10 low, which was the start of a 2-month bull channel.<p>When a channel reverses, the start of the channel is a magnet. If it reaches that target, the Emini typically then goes sideways for at least another 10 to 20 bars. A channel usually evolves into a trading range, and then traders look for the next breakout. The Emini has already evolved into a trading range. Traders are deciding if that is enough of a pause in the bull trend for the bull trend to resume, or if the Emini will test the start of the channel at 3,500.<p>Trading ranges are neutral, although they are more bullish near the top and more bearish near the bottom. Traders should assume that the probability of a successful breakout is about the same for the bulls and bears, until they see a strong breakout.<p>The legs up and down in a trading range tend to lack consecutive strong trend bars. That often makes it impossible to know if a leg will break above, or below the range. By the time the breakout is clear, the Emini will already be halfway to its target.<p>Until the Emini is clearly trending, traders will bet on reversals. It is getting near the top of the range, and therefore traders will look for a minor reversal tomorrow or soon. But the bulls are hoping that this 2-day rally will continue up to 4,000.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. It will probably open within yesterday’s trading range.<p>As strong as the past 2 days were, they might have been too strong. If a market rallies a long way like it has for 2 days, without much of a pullback, it tends to attract profit takers. The profit taking creates a pause or pull back in the trend. Yesterday was a pause, but it might not have been enough to make bulls eager to buy again.<p>The bulls see yesterday as a bull flag. They want yesterday morning’s bull trend to resume up to a new high. However, the bears are hoping that yesterday’s late selloff will be the start of 2 or more legs down.<p>With today opening within yesterday’s range, there is an increased chance of more sideways trading before traders decide on the direction of the breakout. They will continue to look for small reversals until they see a series of strong trend bars up or down. Because today will probably see more profit taking, there is an increased chance of at least one swing up, and one swing down today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range-and-late-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trading range and late trend reversal.

Today traded below yesterday’s low, and it is therefore a 2nd consecutive breakout day. However, yesterday did not close below the January 1 low, and so far, today’s close is also above that support. Additionally, this month-long selloff is still 5 pips above the support of the 1.20 Big Round Number.<p>The bears need consecutive closes below the range to confirm the breakout. While the odds are slightly better for a bear breakout than a bull breakout, until there is a confirmed breakout, there is no breakout.<p>The reason why there are not yet consecutive closes below the range is that the bulls so far have been buying enough to contain the bears. They want the selloff to simply be a test of support at the bottom of a trading range.<p>But the bulls need a strong reversal up. Without that, the bears will probably get their 2 closes below the range, and the EURUSD will probably continue down to the November 4 low at 1.16.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has sold off in a broad bear channel overnight. It has reversed up several times from just above the 1.20 Big Round number over the past few hours. However, the reversals were brief.<p>The EURUSD 5-minute chart has been in a triangle for a couple hours. This is a Breakout Mode pattern. It means that the bears are scalping out of their shorts just above 1.20, and the bulls are willing to buy. However, both sides have been scalping. They are waiting either for a strong bear breakout or a strong reversal up. Until they see that, they will continue to scalp.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-wedge-top-in-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-3-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up from a parabolic wedge bottom to above yesterday’s high. Like the past 2 days, it sold off again at the end of the day. But also like the past 2 days, it again closed above the open.<p>The Emini is at the top of the 5-week trading range. The bulls want another new high. However, there will probably be sellers around the old high since reversals are more common than successful breakouts when a market is in a trading range.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders are buying selloffs and selling rallies. The bulls reversed the market up after 2 big selloffs over the past 5 days. They want a new all-time high. But after a big 2-day rally, there is an increased chance of a selloff for a day or two.<p>The bears are hoping that the rally will fail at the top of the January trading range. They want a reversal down, and for the Emini to break below the trading range, and fall for a 200-point measured move. That would be a test of the November 10 low, which was the start of a 2-month bull channel.<p>When a channel reverses, the start of the channel is a magnet. If it reaches that target, the Emini typically then goes sideways for at least another 10 to 20 bars. A channel usually evolves into a trading range, and then traders look for the next breakout. The Emini has already evolved into a trading range. Traders are deciding if that is enough of a pause in the bull trend for the bull trend to resume, or if the Emini will test the start of the channel at 3,500.<p>Trading ranges are neutral, although they are more bullish near the top and more bearish near the bottom. Traders should assume that the probability of a successful breakout is about the same for the bulls and bears, until they see a strong breakout.<p>The legs up and down in a trading range tend to lack consecutive strong trend bars. That often makes it impossible to know if a leg will break above, or below the range. By the time the breakout is clear, the Emini will already be halfway to its target.<p>Until the Emini is clearly trending, traders will bet on reversals. It is getting near the top of the range, and therefore traders will look for a minor reversal tomorrow or soon. But the bulls are hoping that this 2-day rally will continue up to 4,000.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. It will probably open within yesterday’s trading range.<p>As strong as the past 2 days were, they might have been too strong. If a market rallies a long way like it has for 2 days, without much of a pullback, it tends to attract profit takers. The profit taking creates a pause or pull back in the trend. Yesterday was a pause, but it might not have been enough to make bulls eager to buy again.<p>The bulls see yesterday as a bull flag. They want yesterday morning’s bull trend to resume up to a new high. However, the bears are hoping that yesterday’s late selloff will be the start of 2 or more legs down.<p>With today opening within yesterday’s range, there is an increased chance of more sideways trading before traders decide on the direction of the breakout. They will continue to look for small reversals until they see a series of strong trend bars up or down. Because today will probably see more profit taking, there is an increased chance of at least one swing up, and one swing down today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range-and-late-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trading range and late trend reversal.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-below-trading-range-and-testing-1.20-big-round-number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-3-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex breakout below trading range and testing 1.20 big round number\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart broke below the bottom of the 2-month trading range yesterday. Today traded below yesterday’s low, and it is therefore a 2nd consecutive breakout day. However, yesterday did not close below the January 1 low, and so far, today’s close is also above that support. Additionally, this month-long selloff is still 5 pips above the support of the 1.20 Big Round Number.<p>The bears need consecutive closes below the range to confirm the breakout. While the odds are slightly better for a bear breakout than a bull breakout, until there is a confirmed breakout, there is no breakout.<p>The reason why there are not yet consecutive closes below the range is that the bulls so far have been buying enough to contain the bears. They want the selloff to simply be a test of support at the bottom of a trading range.<p>But the bulls need a strong reversal up. Without that, the bears will probably get their 2 closes below the range, and the EURUSD will probably continue down to the November 4 low at 1.16.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has sold off in a broad bear channel overnight. It has reversed up several times from just above the 1.20 Big Round number over the past few hours. However, the reversals were brief.<p>The EURUSD 5-minute chart has been in a triangle for a couple hours. This is a Breakout Mode pattern. It means that the bears are scalping out of their shorts just above 1.20, and the bulls are willing to buy. However, both sides have been scalping. They are waiting either for a strong bear breakout or a strong reversal up. Until they see that, they will continue to scalp.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-wedge-top-in-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-3-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up from a parabolic wedge bottom to above yesterday’s high. Like the past 2 days, it sold off again at the end of the day. But also like the past 2 days, it again closed above the open.<p>The Emini is at the top of the 5-week trading range. The bulls want another new high. However, there will probably be sellers around the old high since reversals are more common than successful breakouts when a market is in a trading range.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls want a breakout above the month-long trading range, which means testing all-time high from last month.<p>Three consecutive bull days is getting extreme when a market is in a trading range. That increases the chance that the Emini will pull back for a day or so. Therefore, if there is an early rally today, traders will watch for a possible reversal down to below the open and the formation of a bear body on the daily chart.<p>The bears want a reversal down from around last week’s all-time high for a double top. However, after 3 bull days, most traders will want at least a micro double top before shorting.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. Today will therefore open within the 2-day trading range. This increases the chance of more trading range trading today.<p>Because the 3-day rally has been strong, the odds favor at least slightly higher prices soon. However, the Emini could pull back for a day or two first.<p>The all-time high is only about 30 points above the current Globex price. That is less than an average daily range, and it is therefore within reach today.<p>However, with the Emini at the top of a 5-week trading range, there is an increased chance of a reversal down at any time. But the bears will probably need at least another sideways day to create a reliable top on the 60-minute chart. Therefore, the odds favor sideways for at least one more sideways day. If today sells off, the selloff will probably last only one day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-wedge-top-in-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-4.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then wedge top in trading range day.

Today’s low also broke below the 1.20 Big Round Number.<p>Traders see the trading range as both a head and shoulders top, and a lower high major trend reversal. The January 1 low is the neckline. If today and tomorrow both close below the neckline, this would be a confirmed breakout. Traders would then conclude that a measured move down will be likely.<p>The next objective for the bears is to get a couple consecutive closes below the neckline. Then, traders will look for a test of the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the December 1 low. Next is the November 11 higher low and start of a 3-week bull channel. Most important is the November 4 low at the bottom of the most recent leg up on the monthly chart. That is the bottom of a 4-month trading range.<p>There is always a bull case. If the bulls can create a micro double bottom, or one or more surprisingly big bull bars, traders will wonder if the breakout will fail. However, if the bears get a couple closes below the neckline, traders will expect lower prices, even if there is a 2-week rally back up to around the January 22 lower high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to below yesterday’s low, and the 1.20 Big Round Number overnight, but then entered a trading range 5 hours ago. The key price today is the January 1 low of 1.2025. The bears need closes below that low, and it will therefore be important at the end of the day today.<p>With the EURUSD being sideways for several hours, day traders are selling rallies and buying reversals up from the bottom. They also have been scalping.<p>The fight today will be over the 1.2025 January 1 low. If the bears can get today to close below it, that will be a sign of strength. It would be much better for them if today closes far below.<p>The 5-hour trading range is a sign of hesitation and balance. It increases the chance that today will stay around that low all day, and then either close a little below or above it. However, because it is such an important price, there is a slightly increased chance today of either a strong breakout below the trading range, or a strong reversal up. However, stalling at a key price makes a continuation of the trading range with either a small breakout up or down most likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-4-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The lack of strong breakouts in the 1st hour reduced the chance of the rally being very big. The Emini spent a lot of time going sideways, but it kept working higher in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Since today closed at a new all-time high, there is an increased chance that tomorrow will gap up to a another new all-time high.<p>Because today was a buy climax, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading tomorrow that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. This is especially true after 4 consecutive days up in a tight bull channel on the 60-minute chart. However, because the Emini is testing the all-time high, there is an increased chance of either a strong trend up or down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls want a breakout above the month-long trading range, which means testing all-time high from last month.<p>Three consecutive bull days is getting extreme when a market is in a trading range. That increases the chance that the Emini will pull back for a day or so. Therefore, if there is an early rally today, traders will watch for a possible reversal down to below the open and the formation of a bear body on the daily chart.<p>The bears want a reversal down from around last week’s all-time high for a double top. However, after 3 bull days, most traders will want at least a micro double top before shorting.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. Today will therefore open within the 2-day trading range. This increases the chance of more trading range trading today.<p>Because the 3-day rally has been strong, the odds favor at least slightly higher prices soon. However, the Emini could pull back for a day or two first.<p>The all-time high is only about 30 points above the current Globex price. That is less than an average daily range, and it is therefore within reach today.<p>However, with the Emini at the top of a 5-week trading range, there is an increased chance of a reversal down at any time. But the bears will probably need at least another sideways day to create a reliable top on the 60-minute chart. Therefore, the odds favor sideways for at least one more sideways day. If today sells off, the selloff will probably last only one day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-wedge-top-in-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-4.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then wedge top in trading range day. Emini testing all-time high from January.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-below-head-and-shoulders-top-and-1.20-Big-Round-Number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-4-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex breakout below head and shoulders top and 1.20 Big Round Number\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has 3 consecutive days with lows below the bottom of the 2-month trading range. Today’s low also broke below the 1.20 Big Round Number.<p>Traders see the trading range as both a head and shoulders top, and a lower high major trend reversal. The January 1 low is the neckline. If today and tomorrow both close below the neckline, this would be a confirmed breakout. Traders would then conclude that a measured move down will be likely.<p>The next objective for the bears is to get a couple consecutive closes below the neckline. Then, traders will look for a test of the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the December 1 low. Next is the November 11 higher low and start of a 3-week bull channel. Most important is the November 4 low at the bottom of the most recent leg up on the monthly chart. That is the bottom of a 4-month trading range.<p>There is always a bull case. If the bulls can create a micro double bottom, or one or more surprisingly big bull bars, traders will wonder if the breakout will fail. However, if the bears get a couple closes below the neckline, traders will expect lower prices, even if there is a 2-week rally back up to around the January 22 lower high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to below yesterday’s low, and the 1.20 Big Round Number overnight, but then entered a trading range 5 hours ago. The key price today is the January 1 low of 1.2025. The bears need closes below that low, and it will therefore be important at the end of the day today.<p>With the EURUSD being sideways for several hours, day traders are selling rallies and buying reversals up from the bottom. They also have been scalping.<p>The fight today will be over the 1.2025 January 1 low. If the bears can get today to close below it, that will be a sign of strength. It would be much better for them if today closes far below.<p>The 5-hour trading range is a sign of hesitation and balance. It increases the chance that today will stay around that low all day, and then either close a little below or above it. However, because it is such an important price, there is a slightly increased chance today of either a strong breakout below the trading range, or a strong reversal up. However, stalling at a key price makes a continuation of the trading range with either a small breakout up or down most likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-4-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The lack of strong breakouts in the 1st hour reduced the chance of the rally being very big. The Emini spent a lot of time going sideways, but it kept working higher in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Since today closed at a new all-time high, there is an increased chance that tomorrow will gap up to a another new all-time high.<p>Because today was a buy climax, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading tomorrow that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. This is especially true after 4 consecutive days up in a tight bull channel on the 60-minute chart. However, because the Emini is testing the all-time high, there is an increased chance of either a strong trend up or down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It closed on the high and at a new all-time high. There is an increased chance of a gap up today, and an Emini buy climax over the next week, like at September 2 and October 12. The bulls want the rally to continue up to above the 4,000 Big Round Number, before there is more than a small pullback.<p>Despite the strong 4-day rally, the bears are hoping it is just a buy vacuum test of resistance at the January high. They want a reversal down from a double top with the January high. But given that the rally is strong, the bears will probably need a micro double top, before they can get a reversal down to the bottom of the 5-week trading range. Consequently, the bulls will probably buy the 1st 1- to 2-day pullback. Therefore, the downside risk is small over the next few days. Traders will continue to buy small pullbacks, confident that they will keep getting new highs.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 16 points in the Globex session. It therefore will probably gap up above yesterday’s high to a new all-time high. If the gap is small, it will probably close in the 1st hour. However, the Emini is accelerating up, like it did in late August and in October. That increase the chance of a blow-off top over the next several days.<p>If this is the start of a blow-off top, the rally often forms a micro channel on the daily chart (most days having a low above the prior day’s low and a high above the prior day’s high). In a micro channel, the days often are trading range days, but most close above the open. In any case, with the 4 consecutive bull days closing above their midpoints, and breaking to a new high, traders will expect today to again be a sideways to up day. It reduces the chance that today will be a strong bear day.<p>Yesterday was a buy climax day on the 5-minute chart. The day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>One final point about the daily chart. There was a double bottom in September and October. Today will probably open above the measured move target of 3875.75. That increases the chance of some profit taking today, which means the Emini might stall here for a day or two.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-5.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend with potential Emini buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The January 1 low is also the neckline of a head and shoulders top.<p>Today is the day after a breakout, which makes it the follow-through day. The more bearish it is, the more likely the selloff will continue down for a measured move. But the more bullish it is, the more likely the breakout will fail, and the EURUSD will reverse up.<p>At a minimum, the bears want a small bear body. Today would then be the 2nd consecutive close below the January 1 breakout point. That would “confirm” the breakout and increase the chance of lower prices.<p>The bulls want more than a bull body. If they get a big bull bar, traders will conclude that the breakout failed. The odds of a reversal up would further increase if there were several more bull bars over the next several days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up strongly overnight from below yesterday’s low. So far, today is a bull bar closing on its high on the daily chart.<p>If today ends like this, the bears will buy back their shorts, and the bulls will look for at least a few days of sideways to up trading. If they get several bull days, traders will conclude that the breakout failed, and that the rally will test the January 22 lower high in the middle of the 2-month trading range.<p>The overnight reversal is strong enough for traders to only buy. They are buying for a swing up on the daily chart and for scalps. If the rally stalls and evolves into a trading range, the bears will begin to scalp as well.<p>Can today reverse back down to the low? That is unlikely when there is a strong reversal up from a critical price. Therefore, today will probably be sideways to up for the rest of the day.<p>The close will be important. If today closes near its high, it will be a good buy signal bar on the daily chart. The bears do not want that. They will try to get the day to close below the midpoint of the day’s range. But they will probably need at least a 2-hour trading range before they have a chance of achieving their goal.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-trading-range-day-with-triangle-and-ii-final-flags-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-5-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It rallied from a wedge bottom to a new high of the day. But the 1st 2 1/2 hours formed a triangle, which is a magnet for the rest of the day.<p>Today closed just below the open and it therefore had a small bear body. It is therefore a weak sell signal bar on the daily chart for an expanding triangle top. However, there is a 6-bar bull micro channel. The bears therefore typically will want at least a micro double top before shorting in a strong bull trend. Traders will probably buy the 1st 1- or 2-day pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It closed on the high and at a new all-time high. There is an increased chance of a gap up today, and an Emini buy climax over the next week, like at September 2 and October 12. The bulls want the rally to continue up to above the 4,000 Big Round Number, before there is more than a small pullback.<p>Despite the strong 4-day rally, the bears are hoping it is just a buy vacuum test of resistance at the January high. They want a reversal down from a double top with the January high. But given that the rally is strong, the bears will probably need a micro double top, before they can get a reversal down to the bottom of the 5-week trading range. Consequently, the bulls will probably buy the 1st 1- to 2-day pullback. Therefore, the downside risk is small over the next few days. Traders will continue to buy small pullbacks, confident that they will keep getting new highs.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 16 points in the Globex session. It therefore will probably gap up above yesterday’s high to a new all-time high. If the gap is small, it will probably close in the 1st hour. However, the Emini is accelerating up, like it did in late August and in October. That increase the chance of a blow-off top over the next several days.<p>If this is the start of a blow-off top, the rally often forms a micro channel on the daily chart (most days having a low above the prior day’s low and a high above the prior day’s high). In a micro channel, the days often are trading range days, but most close above the open. In any case, with the 4 consecutive bull days closing above their midpoints, and breaking to a new high, traders will expect today to again be a sideways to up day. It reduces the chance that today will be a strong bear day.<p>Yesterday was a buy climax day on the 5-minute chart. The day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>One final point about the daily chart. There was a double bottom in September and October. Today will probably open above the measured move target of 3875.75. That increases the chance of some profit taking today, which means the Emini might stall here for a day or two.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-5.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend with potential Emini buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The January 1 low is also the neckline of a head and shoulders top.<p>Today is the day after a breakout, which makes it the follow-through day. The more bearish it is, the more likely the selloff will continue down for a measured move. But the more bullish it is, the more likely the breakout will fail, and the EURUSD will reverse up.<p>At a minimum, the bears want a small bear body. Today would then be the 2nd consecutive close below the January 1 breakout point. That would “confirm” the breakout and increase the chance of lower prices.<p>The bulls want more than a bull body. If they get a big bull bar, traders will conclude that the breakout failed. The odds of a reversal up would further increase if there were several more bull bars over the next several days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up strongly overnight from below yesterday’s low. So far, today is a bull bar closing on its high on the daily chart.<p>If today ends like this, the bears will buy back their shorts, and the bulls will look for at least a few days of sideways to up trading. If they get several bull days, traders will conclude that the breakout failed, and that the rally will test the January 22 lower high in the middle of the 2-month trading range.<p>The overnight reversal is strong enough for traders to only buy. They are buying for a swing up on the daily chart and for scalps. If the rally stalls and evolves into a trading range, the bears will begin to scalp as well.<p>Can today reverse back down to the low? That is unlikely when there is a strong reversal up from a critical price. Therefore, today will probably be sideways to up for the rest of the day.<p>The close will be important. If today closes near its high, it will be a good buy signal bar on the daily chart. The bears do not want that. They will try to get the day to close below the midpoint of the day’s range. But they will probably need at least a 2-hour trading range before they have a chance of achieving their goal.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-trading-range-day-with-triangle-and-ii-final-flags-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-5-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It rallied from a wedge bottom to a new high of the day. But the 1st 2 1/2 hours formed a triangle, which is a magnet for the rest of the day.<p>Today closed just below the open and it therefore had a small bear body. It is therefore a weak sell signal bar on the daily chart for an expanding triangle top. However, there is a 6-bar bull micro channel. The bears therefore typically will want at least a micro double top before shorting in a strong bull trend. Traders will probably buy the 1st 1- or 2-day pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Last week was a pullback from the breakout below the 2020 trading range, and this week was a resumption of the Small Pullback Bear Trend.<p>Because the chart has been in a tight bear channel since August, many bulls have been buying with limit orders, below prior lows and scaling in. Every new low has led to a pullback to above the breakout point. This has allowed these bull scalpers to take quick profit on the brief bounce, despite the bear trend.<p>However, a bear channel is a bear trend, and it is therefore easier to make money selling. But when a channel is tight, stop entry bears are nearly always selling at the low. Since there are pullbacks from every new low, these bears have to sit through a 1- to 3-bar rally and then another new low before they make money. Therefore entering with stops is not the best choice.<p>But, unfortunately, stop entries are usually the best choice for traders who are starting out. They just have to trade small, and use an appropriate stop above the top of the most recent strong bear breakout.<p>Limit order bears are selling above the high of the prior bar, and many are taking partial profits below the most recent low. That is exactly where the stop entry bears are entering.<p>There is no sign of a bottom yet. The next target is the March 18, 2020 pandemic low. That bar reversed up strongly. The bears want to break below that low. The bulls hope that there will again be buyers there. But if there are, and there is a reversal up, it will probably only last a few weeks. The 1st reversal up from a tight bear channel is typically minor.<h2 id=\"3-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h3 id=\"4-eurusd-on-weekly-chart-is-reversing-down-from-a-wedge-top\">EURUSD on<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart is reversing down from a wedge top</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-reversal-down-from-nested-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-6-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has weak reversal down from nested wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart had a bear bar this week. It has been reversing down from a wedge top, and a double top with the February 2018 high. The bears want the selloff to continue down to the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the November 4 low at 1.16, which is also about a measured move down based on the height of the 8-week trading range.<p>However, this week reversed up strongly on Friday. The week closed in the middle of the week’s range and above the January 1 low, which was the bottom of the range.<p>The inability of the bears to get the week to close below the breakout point, increases the chance of a bounce for at least a week. There could be a rally back up to the January 22 lower high over the next couple weeks. If so, the weekly chart will be back to neutral.<p>Despite the bad close for the bears, this week is a breakout bar. Next week is the follow-through bar. If it is also a bear bar, it will increase the chance of the breakout being successful, especially if it is a big bear bar closing near its low, and below the January 1 low. If it has a small bear body, traders will still expect lower prices, but the bear trend will be somewhat weaker.<p>However, if next week is a bull bar, traders will wonder if the breakout is failing. A big bull bar closing near its high will increase the chance that the breakout has failed. A bar with a small bull body will increase the chance of the EURUSD going sideways for an additional week. Traders will look at that week for either follow-through selling or a reversal up.<h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h3 id=\"6-monthly-emini-chart-has-a-big-bull-bar-at-all-time-high\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has a big bull bar at all-time high</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-fututes-monthly-candlestick-chart-is-breaking-above-nested-bull-channels.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart is breaking above nested bull channels\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart so far in February has a big bull bar closing near its high at the all-time high. This is after a bear bar in January.<p>That bear body in a buy climax increased the chance that February would be sideways or down. There is still a lot of time remaining in February, and the candlestick could look very different when the month closes. For example, if there is a reversal down to below the current low of the month, February would end up as sideways or down. That was the most likely outcome when the month began.<p>Additionally, there would then be a micro double top with the January high on the monthly chart. Many traders would exit longs below February’s low if it closes on its low. It would also be a sell signal bar for a 1- to 3-month pullback.<p>But if February finishes the month on its high, traders will look for a test of the 4,000 Big Round Number in March or April. While I do not trade calendar patterns, it is worth noting that March and April form the most bullish pair of consecutive months.<h3 id=\"7-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-formed-a-small-double-bottom-bull-flag-\"><strong><em><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has formed a small double bottom bull flag</em></strong></h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-fututes-weekly-candlestick-chart-is-breaking-above-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-6-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart is breaking above bull channel. Heading for 4000 big round number.\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a big bull bar this week. It near completely reversed last week’s selloff.<p>Most institutions follow the Globex chart. On the Globex chart (not shown), there are 3 consecutive outside bars. That is an OOO (outside-outside-outside) Breakout Mode pattern. This week’s candlestick is therefore both a buy signal bar, and a sell signal bar for next week<p>On the day session chart above, this week is a buy signal bar for next week. The bulls see last week as the 2nd leg down in a micro double bottom, with the bar from 3 weeks earlier. If next week goes above this week’s high, it would trigger a buy signal. Traders would look for a measured move up, based on the height of the January tight trading range. Since the range is 200 points tall, a measured move up would be well above the 4,000 Big Round Number.<p>However, a tight trading is an area of agreement. Therefore most breakout attempts fail. Furthermore, after there is a breakout, the market tends to get pulled back within 3 to 5 bars into the tight trading range, which traders see as a fair price. Consequently, if the bulls get a rally above 4,000, the January trading range could be the Final Bull Flag. Traders would look for a reversal back down to the bottom of the January range over the following several weeks.<h4 id=\"8-a-reversal-in-a-strong-bull-trend-is-typically-minor\">A reversal in a strong bull trend is typically minor</h4><p>Just like tight trading ranges resist change, so do trends. The Emini weekly chart has been in a strong bull trend for 11 months. Every reversal attempt failed within a few weeks. It was soon followed by a new high in the bull trend.<p>Traders will continue to expect new highs until there is a clear, strong reversal down. So, even if a break above 4,000 reverses back down to the January Final Flag, the reversal will probably be minor. Traders would look for the selloff to last a few weeks, or for a trading range to form for a couple months, like in September and October. They then would expect another new high.<h3 id=\"9-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-market-breaking-above-january-trading-range\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures market breaking above January trading range</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SP500-Emini-futures-daily-chart-testing-top-of-bull-channel-but-possible-expanding-triangle-top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-6-4.jpg\" alt=\"SP500 Emini futures daily chart testing top of bull channel but possible expanding triangle top at possible big round number\"></a></figure><p>The S&amp;P500 Emini futures market reversed up strongly on the daily chart this week, after selling off sharply twice last week. If a market tries hard to do something 2 or more times and fails, it often then tries the opposite direction. The Emini this week broke above the January trading range to a new all-time high. It also reached a measured move up from the September/October double bottom. A measured move up based on the height of the 5-week trading range is at the 4,000 Big Round Number.<p>While the Emini will probably trade at least a little higher after this week’s rally, the probability of breaking strongly above 4,000 before there is a 2- to 3-week pullback is still only 50%.<p>If the bears get a reversal down within the next couple weeks, there will be an expanding triangle top. The 1st 2 highs came on January 8 and January 26. Every expanding triangle top is also a higher high major trend reversal. If the reversal begins with a good sell signal bar and consecutive strong bear bars, the bears would have a 40% chance of a trend reversal on the daily chart.<h4 id=\"10-possible-blow-off-top\">Possible blow-off top</h4><p>This week’s rally was strong, and it is coming late in a bull trend. It is similar to the rallies to the September 2 high and the October 12 high. Both of those were blow-off tops (exhaustive buy climaxes) that led to 10% corrections over the following few weeks.<p>Also, the Emini is still in a bull channel, which has a 75% chance of a bear breakout. But until there are a consecutive strong bear bars, traders will continue to buy every selloff, betting on higher prices.<h4 id=\"11-1st-reversal-will-probably-be-minor\">1st Reversal will probably be minor</h4><p>If the Emini falls to the start of the November bull channel at 3,500, would that be a major trend reversal? No, that would not be enough. A major trend reversal is a conversion into a bear trend from a bull trend. Even a 10% selloff to 3,500 would still probably only be a leg down in a trading range, and not the start of a bear trend.<p>The trading range could last a month or two, like in June, 2020 and September through October. The odds would still favor a resumption of the bull trend. But if the trading range lasts about 20 bars, the bears would have a 50% chance of at least a 2nd leg down.<p>So what is most likely near-term? The same thing that I have been writing every week. While the odds of a 10% correction are increasing, when looking over the next week or so, the odds continue to favor at least slightly higher prices. Markets have inertia. They tend to continue to do what they’ve been doing. If there is a bull trend, the odds always at least slightly favor higher prices.<h2 id=\"12-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is now at the all-time high, at a measured move target, and it might gap up to a new high again today.<p>This is a buy climax, similar to the rallies that ended on September 2 and on October 12. It could last several more days before there is a pullback. Once there is a pullback from an extreme buy climax, it often will last several weeks. Those other 2 buy climaxes led to 10% corrections over the next month. However, there is no sign of a top yet. Traders will continue to bet on new highs until there are consecutive big bear days.<p>Last week broke above the top of a month-long trading range. Additionally, Friday reached the measured move target based on the September/October double bottom. Finally, the Emini is testing the 3,900 Big Round Number. When the Emini reaches obvious targets, many bulls take partial profits. This often results in a few sideways bars. Friday was a small bear bar, and it was sideways on the 5-minute chart. There is an increased chance of more sideways trading today.<p>Friday is a sell signal bar for an Expanding Triangle top with the January 8 and January 26 highs. That is a type of higher high major trend reversal. With the daily chart being overbought, traders expect a 10% pullback soon. But it only had a small bear body, and it is therefore a weak sell signal bar. Also, there is a 6-day bull micro channel (no pullback for 6 days), which is a sign of eager bulls. Traders will probably buy the 1st 1- or 2-day pullback. However, if the bears get a micro double top this week, traders will be more willing to short.<p>Can the Emini race up to far above the 4,000 Big Round Number? It probably won’t. It is already overbought, and that is also above the top of the 3-month bull channel. The buy climax can continue a few more days, but probably not much longer before the bulls begin to take some profits.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 16 points in the Globex session. It might gap up to a new all-time high on the daily and weekly charts. If so, the gap will be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>With Friday’s range being small, and with the Emini testing the 3,900 Big Round Number, there is an increased chance that today will trade above Friday’s high and then below Friday’s low. Today would then be an outside down day, and a sell signal bar on the daily chart. But with the 6-day rally as strong as it has been, the Emini will probably have to go sideways, for at least a couple days before it goes down. Therefore, even if today is an outside down day, it will probably not be a big bear day.<p>The Emini stalled for several days at the 3,700 and 3,800 Big Round Numbers. The Emini broke above 3,900 in the Globex session. There is an increased chance of it stalling here as well. That reduces the chance of a big bull day, despite the strong 6-day rally.<p>With the Emini unlikely to have a big bear or big bull day, there is an increased chance that today will have a lot of trading range price action.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-trading-range-day-with-triangle-and-ii-final-flags-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-8.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with triangle and ii final flags, and at measured move target.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It is a buy signal bar for a failed breakout. Friday was strong enough so that the bulls might get a small 2nd leg sideways to up this week.<p>But is it strong enough to be the end of the 6-week bear trend? Probably not. The bulls will need to break strongly above the bear trend line, and then above the January 22 lower high.<p>Also, the spike down to the January 11 low could be the start of a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. If so, the channel typically has at least 3 clear legs down. Friday was a credible end of the 2nd, but there should be at least one more leg down.<p>Additionally, when there is a trend reversal down after a buy climax, the selloff usually reaches the bottom of the buy climax. That is the December 1 low. Consequently, even if the EURUSD goes sideways to up this week, the odds favor at least slightly lower prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market triggered the buy signal on the daily chart overnight, by going above Friday’s high. After pulling back, it tried again, and failed a 2nd time to begin a trend up.<p>However, the reversal down from above yesterday’s high has been weak. The EURUSD has been trading sideways to down in a small range all night. Day traders have only been scalping. But the range has been so small,that it has been difficult to make even a 10-pip scalp..<p>The day after a big reversal day often is a small trading range day. Traders sometimes need several days to decide if the reversal will begin a trend up, or form a bear flag and lead to a resumption of the bear trend. That is what is happening now, and it could result in a few trading range days this week.<p>Can today become a big trend day in either direction? With it being in a small trading range in the overnight session, on the day after a big reversal up, it will more likely remain a trading range day. But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, day traders will quickly switch to swing trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-8-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Since the gap was small, traders expected it to close, which it did.<p>Today was a bear Trending Trading Range Day, but it rallied in the final 2 hours and closed above the 3,900 Big Round Number. The Emini has rallied strongly for 6 days with no sign of a top. However, it went sideways on the daily chart around every Big Round number since 3,500. Traders will expect that again. It could go sideways for a couple days or a couple weeks.<p>There is room to the top of the bull channel on the daily chart, and that is the next magnet above, just above 3,920. A more important magnet is the 4,000 Big Round Number. But it might be too far to reach before there is a 10% pullback. However, until there are consecutive strong bear days on the daily chart, traders will continue to buy, as they have done since late October.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, day traders will quickly switch to swing trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-8-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Since the gap was small, traders expected it to close, which it did.<p>Today was a bear Trending Trading Range Day, but it rallied in the final 2 hours and closed above the 3,900 Big Round Number. The Emini has rallied strongly for 6 days with no sign of a top. However, it went sideways on the daily chart around every Big Round number since 3,500. Traders will expect that again. It could go sideways for a couple days or a couple weeks.<p>There is room to the top of the bull channel on the daily chart, and that is the next magnet above, just above 3,920. A more important magnet is the 4,000 Big Round Number. But it might be too far to reach before there is a 10% pullback. However, until there are consecutive strong bear days on the daily chart, traders will continue to buy, as they have done since late October.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was the 6th consecutive day without a pullback. This is now a 7-bar bull micro channel, which means the Emini is extremely overbought. It closed on its high, which often increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices today. However, yesterday ended with a buy climax on the 5-minute chart. A buy climax on the daily chart often ends with a buy climax on the 5-min chart. Also, February tends to be a down month.<p>With the Emini in a buy climax, there will probably be a 1- to 3-day pullback this week. But, the bull trend has been strong, and traders will buy the pullback. Until there are consecutive big bear days, traders will continue to buy, betting on another new high. This has worked since late October.<p>The bulls want a breakout above the 4-month bull channel, which is about 10 points above yesterday’s high. But most breakout attempts above bull channels fail. Therefore, the Emini will probably reverse down from above the channel within the next week.<p>A more important magnet is the 4,000 Big Round Number. Yesterday broke above the 3900 Big Round Number, but spent most of the day going sideways. It stalled at least for a few days at every Big Round Number since 3,500, and that makes it likely to do that again.<p>Will the Emini break strongly above 4,000 before there is a 10% pullback? With the Emini in a buy climax, like in September and October, there is a 50% chance of a 10% pullback, before a strong break strong above 4,000. But the bull trend has been strong. There could be a small break above 4,000 before there is more than a 3-day pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Yesterday ended with an extreme buy climax on the 5-minute chart, at a new all-time high with the daily chart in an extreme buy climax. Traders expect at least a small pullback this week. It might start today.<p>The day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. Can today be a strong bear trend day? With the strong bull trend in the daily chart, the bears will probably need to stop the buying before they can begin strong selling. Therefore, if today is a bear trend day, it will probably not be a big bear day.<p>Can today be a big bull trend day? Since yesterday was a likely exhaustive buy climax, there is only a 25% chance of a strong bull trend day today.<p>So, if today is probably not going to trend strongly up or down, that leaves either a trading range day, or a weak trend in either direction. But if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction on the open, the odds of a strong trend will increase.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-9.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day with late bull breakout.

The rally today broke above the bear channel, and back above the January 18 low. Traders expect a couple legs sideways to up after a 6-week sell climax.<p>If today closes near its high, traders will expect a couple legs up to the January 22 lower high. A strong break above that high will end the bear channel. The daily chart will be back to neutral, and in the middle of its 3-month trading range.<p>But if today closes below the bear trend line, traders will expect the 2nd leg to be more sideways than up. Furthermore, they will conclude that the bear trend is probably still intact.<p>A market often breaks above a channel, but then turns down and makes another new low. This results in a broader channel, which means that the bear trend is still underway. Unless the EURUSD breaks above the January 22 high, the odds still favor lower prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight and broke above the bear trend line on the daily chart. However, it pulled back almost 30 pips over the past few hours, to just above that trend line, which is around 1.2080. That is enough to make bears expect a trading range. Day traders will therefore probably start to sell rallies in addition to buying pullbacks.<p>The key price is the bear trend line on the daily chart. It is the top of the 6-week bear channel. If the bears can get today to close below the line, and below the midpoint of today’s range, traders will view the 3-day rally as a likely bear flag within a bear channel. While there will probably be a 2nd leg up after the sell climax on the daily chart, it might be more sideways than up.<p>But if the bulls can get today to close on the high of the day and far above the bear trend line, the odds of a test of the January 22 lower high will be more than 50%. Traders will expect the 2nd leg up to be more up than sideways.<p>Therefore, the daily bear trend line could be a magnet all day. Sometimes a chart will oscillate around a magnet and then decide in the final hour whether to close above or below it. With the trading range trading of the past hour, that process might be beginning.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then broad bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up from a sell climax to near yesterday’s high. It then reversed down from a wedge top. The bulls got a reversal back up from a higher low double bottom, and today formed a Broad Bull Channel.<p>On the daily chart it was another bull day and the 8th day in a bull micro channel. This is a buy climax, but there is no top yet. Also, the 4,000 Big Round Number is an important magnet above. There is a 50% chance of a 10% correction before the Emini gets far about 4,000.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The rally today broke above the bear channel, and back above the January 18 low. Traders expect a couple legs sideways to up after a 6-week sell climax.<p>If today closes near its high, traders will expect a couple legs up to the January 22 lower high. A strong break above that high will end the bear channel. The daily chart will be back to neutral, and in the middle of its 3-month trading range.<p>But if today closes below the bear trend line, traders will expect the 2nd leg to be more sideways than up. Furthermore, they will conclude that the bear trend is probably still intact.<p>A market often breaks above a channel, but then turns down and makes another new low. This results in a broader channel, which means that the bear trend is still underway. Unless the EURUSD breaks above the January 22 high, the odds still favor lower prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight and broke above the bear trend line on the daily chart. However, it pulled back almost 30 pips over the past few hours, to just above that trend line, which is around 1.2080. That is enough to make bears expect a trading range. Day traders will therefore probably start to sell rallies in addition to buying pullbacks.<p>The key price is the bear trend line on the daily chart. It is the top of the 6-week bear channel. If the bears can get today to close below the line, and below the midpoint of today’s range, traders will view the 3-day rally as a likely bear flag within a bear channel. While there will probably be a 2nd leg up after the sell climax on the daily chart, it might be more sideways than up.<p>But if the bulls can get today to close on the high of the day and far above the bear trend line, the odds of a test of the January 22 lower high will be more than 50%. Traders will expect the 2nd leg up to be more up than sideways.<p>Therefore, the daily bear trend line could be a magnet all day. Sometimes a chart will oscillate around a magnet and then decide in the final hour whether to close above or below it. With the trading range trading of the past hour, that process might be beginning.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then broad bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up from a sell climax to near yesterday’s high. It then reversed down from a wedge top. The bulls got a reversal back up from a higher low double bottom, and today formed a Broad Bull Channel.<p>On the daily chart it was another bull day and the 8th day in a bull micro channel. This is a buy climax, but there is no top yet. Also, the 4,000 Big Round Number is an important magnet above. There is a 50% chance of a 10% correction before the Emini gets far about 4,000.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Since this is unusual, there is an increased chance of a pullback within the next few days.<p>This is a very strong rally, but it has gone a long way from the January 29 low without a pullback. It is therefore climactic. The rally is similar to the buy climaxes that ended on January 2 and October 12.<p>The bulls want the rally to continue far above the 4,000 Big Round Number. However, the Emini is just below the top of the 4-month bull channel that began on November 9. The top of the channel today is around 3,927. Most attempts to break above bull channels fail within about 5 days. Therefore, this rally will probably stop within a week.<p>Whether it reverses down is another story. Traders will buy every reversal down until there are consecutive big bear bars on the daily chart. Once they see that, they will look for a couple legs down over several weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up about 10 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up. If the gap is less than 5 points, it will probably close within the 1st hour.<p>The top of the bull channel on the daily chart is around 3,927 today. That is an obvious magnet, and the Emini might have to get there today. The bulls want it to break strongly above it, but yesterday was a broad bull channel. That is a trading range that is tilted up. It increases the chance of more trading range trading today. Also, after 8 days up, the bulls are probably getting exhausted. That reduces the chance of a big bull day.<p>What about a big reversal down? The past 4 days have had small ranges. That reduces the chance of a big day today.<p>Since the daily chart is in a buy climax and yesterday’s range was small, if there is early strong selling today, today could reverse down to below yesterday’s low. It would then be an outside down day. Traders would then wonder if this week would close below the open of the week, and form a reversal bar on the weekly chart.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-10.png\" alt=\"sell climax and high 2 in emini then broad bull channel.

That low is the bottom of a 2-month trading range. Today broke above last week’s high. This week therefore totally reversed last week’s selloff on the weekly chart.<p>The reversal on the daily chart is far enough above the bear trend line from the January 6 high to make a 2nd leg up likely. Therefore, the bulls will buy the 1st 1- to 3-day selloff.<p>Traders will then expect a test of the January 22 lower high. If the rally breaks strongly above that, traders will conclude that the bear trend reversal has failed. They would conclude that the EURUSD was either back to neutral, or resuming is bull trend from last March.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market is trading above its open and above yesterday’s high. If today closes above the open, there will be 4 consecutive bull days on the daily chart.<p>However, the rally lacks consecutive big bull days. It is therefore not nearly as strong as it could be. That increases the chance of a pullback within a couple days. If today closes below the open, there will probably be at least a small pullback tomorrow. A pullback is a day that trades below the low of the prior day.<p>Today’s range so far is small. The EURUSD has been in a trading range overnight. Day traders have been scalping up and down for 10 pips. There is no sign that this is about to change. The bulls want a 4th bull day, and the bears want a pullback tomorrow. Therefore, today’s open will be important. If the bulls can get today to close above the open, they will look for higher prices tomorrow. If the bears can get today to close below the open, traders will expect at least a small pullback tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-outside-down-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and outside down day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini today gapped up to a new all-time high, but then reversed down to below yesterday’s low. It is a sell signal bar on the daily chart. But it was not a big bear day closing on its low, and it is therefore a weak sell signal bar. In addition, after an 8-day bull micro channel, the 1st reversal down typically only lasts 1- to 3- days. Also, the day after a big day that closes in its middle more often than not mostly overlaps the big day.<p>The Emini is in a buy climax at the top of a 4-month bull channel. Traders should expect a 10% pullback to begin at any time. But the bears will probably need at least a micro double top before a reversal will begin.<p>Furthermore, every strong bull trend has lots of minor reversals. Yet traders buy them, confident that they will be brief and soon lead to a new high. They will continue to buy reversals until there are consecutive big bear bars. At that point, the odds will shift in favor of a 10% pullback.<p>Today’s selloff was a test of the open of the week. It could be a magnet in the final hour on Friday. The bears want the week to close below the open of the week. This week would then have a bear body. It would be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart for a possible reversal down from the top of the 4-month bull channel.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders would then wonder if this week would close below the open of the week, and form a reversal bar on the weekly chart.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-10.png\" alt=\"sell climax and high 2 in emini then broad bull channel.

That low is the bottom of a 2-month trading range. Today broke above last week’s high. This week therefore totally reversed last week’s selloff on the weekly chart.<p>The reversal on the daily chart is far enough above the bear trend line from the January 6 high to make a 2nd leg up likely. Therefore, the bulls will buy the 1st 1- to 3-day selloff.<p>Traders will then expect a test of the January 22 lower high. If the rally breaks strongly above that, traders will conclude that the bear trend reversal has failed. They would conclude that the EURUSD was either back to neutral, or resuming is bull trend from last March.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market is trading above its open and above yesterday’s high. If today closes above the open, there will be 4 consecutive bull days on the daily chart.<p>However, the rally lacks consecutive big bull days. It is therefore not nearly as strong as it could be. That increases the chance of a pullback within a couple days. If today closes below the open, there will probably be at least a small pullback tomorrow. A pullback is a day that trades below the low of the prior day.<p>Today’s range so far is small. The EURUSD has been in a trading range overnight. Day traders have been scalping up and down for 10 pips. There is no sign that this is about to change. The bulls want a 4th bull day, and the bears want a pullback tomorrow. Therefore, today’s open will be important. If the bulls can get today to close above the open, they will look for higher prices tomorrow. If the bears can get today to close below the open, traders will expect at least a small pullback tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-outside-down-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and outside down day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini today gapped up to a new all-time high, but then reversed down to below yesterday’s low. It is a sell signal bar on the daily chart. But it was not a big bear day closing on its low, and it is therefore a weak sell signal bar. In addition, after an 8-day bull micro channel, the 1st reversal down typically only lasts 1- to 3- days. Also, the day after a big day that closes in its middle more often than not mostly overlaps the big day.<p>The Emini is in a buy climax at the top of a 4-month bull channel. Traders should expect a 10% pullback to begin at any time. But the bears will probably need at least a micro double top before a reversal will begin.<p>Furthermore, every strong bull trend has lots of minor reversals. Yet traders buy them, confident that they will be brief and soon lead to a new high. They will continue to buy reversals until there are consecutive big bear bars. At that point, the odds will shift in favor of a 10% pullback.<p>Today’s selloff was a test of the open of the week. It could be a magnet in the final hour on Friday. The bears want the week to close below the open of the week. This week would then have a bear body. It would be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart for a possible reversal down from the top of the 4-month bull channel.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday was therefore an outside down bar on the daily chart. It is a sell signal bar for today. But it closed near the middle of the range instead of on the low. This is a weak sell signal bar. The Emini is more likely to go sideways today instead of down.<p>The day after a big day that closes in the middle of its range tends to mostly overlap the prior day’s range. Also, there is an increased chance of an inside day. Traders will look for a reversal up from around yesterday’s low, and for a reversal down from around yesterday’s high.<p>The bears want a reversal down on the daily chart from the top of a 4-month bull channel. Also, the Emini is just above the measured move target from the September/October double bottom.<p>However, yesterday was the 1st pullback after an 8-day bull micro channel. That means the bulls have been aggressive. The bears typically need at least a micro double top before they can get more than a 3-day pullback in a strong bull trend.<p>Also, traders want to see at least a couple consecutive big bear bars on the daily chart, before concluding that a 10% correction has begun. Without that, traders will continue to buy every 1- to 3-day reversal down.<p>Yesterday tested the open of the week. Tomorrow is Friday, and the open of the week might be a magnet, especially in the final hour. This increases the chance of the Emini going sideways into the end of the week.<p>The bulls want the week to have a bull bar on the weekly chart after last week’s big bull bar. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>But the bears want the week to close below the open, and preferably on the low of the week. This week would then be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. It would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>It is important to note that the buy climax has gone on for several months on the daily chart. That is a long time. With the Emini now at the top of the bull channel, there is an increased chance of a 5 – 10% pullback coming at any time.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. It will gap above yesterday’s close on the 5-minute chart, but probably not above yesterday’s high. Remember, since yesterday had a big range, and it closed in the middle, there is an increased chance of sellers today around yesterday’s high, and buyers near yesterday’s low.<p>Can today be a big bull day? Of, course it can. The Emini has rallied strongly for 8 days and several of the days closed near their highs. However, the rally covered a lot of points with only small pullbacks. That increases the chance of the bulls beginning to take some profits, which reduces the chance of a big bull day.<p>What about a big bear day? Yesterday rallied in a bull channel. Traders should think of a bull channel as a bear flag since the breakout is usually below. So, yes, the bears can get trend resumption down from yesterday’s early selloff. But as I said, the day after a big day tends to mostly overlap that day. That increases the chance of trading range trading today and it reduces the chance of a strong trend up or down.<p>Also, this week’s range is small. It might stay small and close near the open tomorrow. That further reduces the chance of a big trend today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-outside-down-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-11.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and outside down bar day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders expect at least a couple legs up to the January 22 high. Therefore, the bulls will buy the 1st 1- to 3-day pullback.<p>Today is a 3rd big bull body in the rally. That means it is the 3rd push up, and there must be a parabolic wedge on a lower time frame, like the 60-minute chart. That increases the chance of a pullback coming soon. For example, if today reverses down to the low of the session by the end of the day, there would be a micro double top on the daily chart. That would probably lead to at least a small pullback starting tomorrow.<p>Tomorrow is Friday and therefore traders will pay attention to the weekly chart today and tomorrow. Last week was a big bear bar. This week has totally reversed last week’s selloff. The bulls want the week to close on its high, and above last week’s high. That would increases the chances of at least slightly higher prices next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied since opening near yesterday’s close. While it spent several hours going sideways overnight, it broke to the upside over the past hour to above yesterday’s high. The bulls would like today to close above yesterday’s high. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p>Remember, the daily chart is overbought. Traders expect a pullback soon. There is therefore an increased risk of a reversal down later in the day today. But since the EURUSD is in the midst of a bull breakout on the 5 minute chart, day traders are currently only buying.<p>But if the EURUSD begins to go sideways again, the bears will start to sell. They will initially only scalp. However, if they can stop the bulls and create a trading range for a couple hours, they will have a 40% chance of a reversal down late in the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-midday-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini midday bull trend reversal from wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then formed a lower trading range. Today was a Bear Trending Trading Range day. It also reversed up from a wedge bottom in the middle of the day, but the day closed below the open. It was a bear doji inside bar on the daily chart.<p>As I said was likely, today overlapped yesterday. It was also an inside day after yesterday being an outside day. An inside day after an outside day is an ioi Breakout Mode pattern. Today is both a buy and sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>But yesterday and today spent a lot of time around the open of the week, which means it is an important price. With tomorrow being Friday and with this week being small, there is an increased chance of the Emini getting pulled to the open of the week in the final hour tomorrow. This reduces the chance that tomorrow will be a strong trend day up or down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday was therefore an outside down bar on the daily chart. It is a sell signal bar for today. But it closed near the middle of the range instead of on the low. This is a weak sell signal bar. The Emini is more likely to go sideways today instead of down.<p>The day after a big day that closes in the middle of its range tends to mostly overlap the prior day’s range. Also, there is an increased chance of an inside day. Traders will look for a reversal up from around yesterday’s low, and for a reversal down from around yesterday’s high.<p>The bears want a reversal down on the daily chart from the top of a 4-month bull channel. Also, the Emini is just above the measured move target from the September/October double bottom.<p>However, yesterday was the 1st pullback after an 8-day bull micro channel. That means the bulls have been aggressive. The bears typically need at least a micro double top before they can get more than a 3-day pullback in a strong bull trend.<p>Also, traders want to see at least a couple consecutive big bear bars on the daily chart, before concluding that a 10% correction has begun. Without that, traders will continue to buy every 1- to 3-day reversal down.<p>Yesterday tested the open of the week. Tomorrow is Friday, and the open of the week might be a magnet, especially in the final hour. This increases the chance of the Emini going sideways into the end of the week.<p>The bulls want the week to have a bull bar on the weekly chart after last week’s big bull bar. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>But the bears want the week to close below the open, and preferably on the low of the week. This week would then be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. It would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>It is important to note that the buy climax has gone on for several months on the daily chart. That is a long time. With the Emini now at the top of the bull channel, there is an increased chance of a 5 – 10% pullback coming at any time.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. It will gap above yesterday’s close on the 5-minute chart, but probably not above yesterday’s high. Remember, since yesterday had a big range, and it closed in the middle, there is an increased chance of sellers today around yesterday’s high, and buyers near yesterday’s low.<p>Can today be a big bull day? Of, course it can. The Emini has rallied strongly for 8 days and several of the days closed near their highs. However, the rally covered a lot of points with only small pullbacks. That increases the chance of the bulls beginning to take some profits, which reduces the chance of a big bull day.<p>What about a big bear day? Yesterday rallied in a bull channel. Traders should think of a bull channel as a bear flag since the breakout is usually below. So, yes, the bears can get trend resumption down from yesterday’s early selloff. But as I said, the day after a big day tends to mostly overlap that day. That increases the chance of trading range trading today and it reduces the chance of a strong trend up or down.<p>Also, this week’s range is small. It might stay small and close near the open tomorrow. That further reduces the chance of a big trend today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-outside-down-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-11.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and outside down bar day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-strong-reversal-up-from-failed-breakout-below-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-11-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex strong reversal up from failed breakout below trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been rallying for 5 days from a failed breakout below a 2-month trading range. Traders expect at least a couple legs up to the January 22 high. Therefore, the bulls will buy the 1st 1- to 3-day pullback.<p>Today is a 3rd big bull body in the rally. That means it is the 3rd push up, and there must be a parabolic wedge on a lower time frame, like the 60-minute chart. That increases the chance of a pullback coming soon. For example, if today reverses down to the low of the session by the end of the day, there would be a micro double top on the daily chart. That would probably lead to at least a small pullback starting tomorrow.<p>Tomorrow is Friday and therefore traders will pay attention to the weekly chart today and tomorrow. Last week was a big bear bar. This week has totally reversed last week’s selloff. The bulls want the week to close on its high, and above last week’s high. That would increases the chances of at least slightly higher prices next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied since opening near yesterday’s close. While it spent several hours going sideways overnight, it broke to the upside over the past hour to above yesterday’s high. The bulls would like today to close above yesterday’s high. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p>Remember, the daily chart is overbought. Traders expect a pullback soon. There is therefore an increased risk of a reversal down later in the day today. But since the EURUSD is in the midst of a bull breakout on the 5 minute chart, day traders are currently only buying.<p>But if the EURUSD begins to go sideways again, the bears will start to sell. They will initially only scalp. However, if they can stop the bulls and create a trading range for a couple hours, they will have a 40% chance of a reversal down late in the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-midday-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini midday bull trend reversal from wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then formed a lower trading range. Today was a Bear Trending Trading Range day. It also reversed up from a wedge bottom in the middle of the day, but the day closed below the open. It was a bear doji inside bar on the daily chart.<p>As I said was likely, today overlapped yesterday. It was also an inside day after yesterday being an outside day. An inside day after an outside day is an ioi Breakout Mode pattern. Today is both a buy and sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>But yesterday and today spent a lot of time around the open of the week, which means it is an important price. With tomorrow being Friday and with this week being small, there is an increased chance of the Emini getting pulled to the open of the week in the final hour tomorrow. This reduces the chance that tomorrow will be a strong trend day up or down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

An Emini ioi Breakout Mode setup (inside-outside-inside pattern). Yesterday is both a buy and sell signal bar.<p>Because yesterday had a bear body, it is a lower probability buy signal bar. But since the 2-week bull channel is tight, and yesterday had a big tail below, it is a low probability sell signal bar. If it is bad for both the bulls and bears. Who is it good for? Limit order traders. There might be more sellers above and buyers below.<p>Both yesterday and Wednesday spent a lot of time around the open of the week. That means it is important. The bears want the weekly chart to have a bear body. It would then be a sell signal bar.<p>However, the bulls want a bull body. That would increase the chance of sideways to up trading next week.<p>Because the open of the week is important, it could be a magnet in the final hour today. If the Emini is within 10 to 20 points of the open going into the final hour, it might get drawn to the open of the week at the close of the week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 7 points in the Globex session. It has been forming a triangle over the past 3 days, on the day session chart around a cluster of magnets. These are the open of the week, the 3,900 Big Round Number, and the 60-minute EMA.<p>The most important price is the open of the week. If the Emini closes below the week’s open, this week will have a bear body and be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. The bigger the bear body is, the more reliable the sell setup will be. If the Emini is within 10- to 20-points of the open in the final hour, traders should look for a reversal to the open.<p>It is important to understand that when there is a magnet like this, the market often decides to ignore it at the end of the day. For example, there could be either a late strong rally to far above it, or a late strong selloff to far below it.<p>Can today be either a strong trend day up or down? Any day can, but it has been paying a lot of attention to those magnets this week. That increases the chance that the week will remain small, and traders will wait for next week to decide on the direction of the next move. But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down on the open, there will be an increased chance of a trend day today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-midday-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-12.png\" alt=\"Emini midday bull trend reversal from wedge bottom leading to Emini ioi breakout mode setup.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bears are hoping that yesterday was the end of a leg up. Since the rally is a small wedge top, they expect at least a couple legs sideways to down over the next few days. They want yesterday be a lower high double top with the January 22 lower high, and they want today to be a resumption of the bear trend.<p>However, after a strong 5-day rally and a break above the bear channel, it is more likely that the bulls will buy this selloff. There should be a higher low, and a 2nd leg sideways to up. Therefore, the best the bears will probably get is about a 50% pullback for a few days that tests the January 1 low. The bulls should buy at that point.<p>If the bulls fail to get a strong breakout above the January 22 high, the bears will get another leg down. If they then get a strong break below the February 5 neckline of that double top, traders will expect a measured move down to the November 4 low at 1.16.<p>This decision process will take some time. Consequently, traders should expect at least a couple small reversals over the next two weeks, before the market decides between a continued bear trend or a resumption of last year’s bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to far below yesterday’s low. This triggered a parabolic wedge sell signal on the daily chart. The selloff should reach the January 1 low at around 1.20 over the next several days.<p>While the overnight selloff has not yet been particularly strong, the pullbacks have been small. Day traders have only been selling.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways for a month and today’s range is about average. Also, the overnight selloff has not had consecutive big bear bars and therefore is not very strong. Therefore, there may not be much left to the selloff. But until there is a 20- to 30-pip bounce, day traders will only sell. Once there is a bounce, day traders will expect the bear trend to evolve into a trading range. At that point, they will also look to buy reversals up from the low for scalps.<p>Can today reverse back up to the high? Yes, but it is more likely that it will be sideways to down. This is because the parabolic wedge top on the daily chart should lead to a few days down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-trading-range-and-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-12-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It also closed at a new all-time high.<p>While Tuesday might gap up, today’s close was a buy climax. There is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour on Tuesday.<p>The weekly chart had a bull body this week, which confirms last week’s strong reversal up. It increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week. Next might even gap up to a new all-time high on the weekly chart.

An Emini ioi Breakout Mode setup (inside-outside-inside pattern). Yesterday is both a buy and sell signal bar.<p>Because yesterday had a bear body, it is a lower probability buy signal bar. But since the 2-week bull channel is tight, and yesterday had a big tail below, it is a low probability sell signal bar. If it is bad for both the bulls and bears. Who is it good for? Limit order traders. There might be more sellers above and buyers below.<p>Both yesterday and Wednesday spent a lot of time around the open of the week. That means it is important. The bears want the weekly chart to have a bear body. It would then be a sell signal bar.<p>However, the bulls want a bull body. That would increase the chance of sideways to up trading next week.<p>Because the open of the week is important, it could be a magnet in the final hour today. If the Emini is within 10 to 20 points of the open going into the final hour, it might get drawn to the open of the week at the close of the week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 7 points in the Globex session. It has been forming a triangle over the past 3 days, on the day session chart around a cluster of magnets. These are the open of the week, the 3,900 Big Round Number, and the 60-minute EMA.<p>The most important price is the open of the week. If the Emini closes below the week’s open, this week will have a bear body and be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. The bigger the bear body is, the more reliable the sell setup will be. If the Emini is within 10- to 20-points of the open in the final hour, traders should look for a reversal to the open.<p>It is important to understand that when there is a magnet like this, the market often decides to ignore it at the end of the day. For example, there could be either a late strong rally to far above it, or a late strong selloff to far below it.<p>Can today be either a strong trend day up or down? Any day can, but it has been paying a lot of attention to those magnets this week. That increases the chance that the week will remain small, and traders will wait for next week to decide on the direction of the next move. But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down on the open, there will be an increased chance of a trend day today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-midday-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-12.png\" alt=\"Emini midday bull trend reversal from wedge bottom leading to Emini ioi breakout mode setup.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-minor-reversal-down-from-small-parabolic-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-12-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex minor reversal down from small parabolic wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been in a bear channel for 6 weeks. The bears are hoping that yesterday was the end of a leg up. Since the rally is a small wedge top, they expect at least a couple legs sideways to down over the next few days. They want yesterday be a lower high double top with the January 22 lower high, and they want today to be a resumption of the bear trend.<p>However, after a strong 5-day rally and a break above the bear channel, it is more likely that the bulls will buy this selloff. There should be a higher low, and a 2nd leg sideways to up. Therefore, the best the bears will probably get is about a 50% pullback for a few days that tests the January 1 low. The bulls should buy at that point.<p>If the bulls fail to get a strong breakout above the January 22 high, the bears will get another leg down. If they then get a strong break below the February 5 neckline of that double top, traders will expect a measured move down to the November 4 low at 1.16.<p>This decision process will take some time. Consequently, traders should expect at least a couple small reversals over the next two weeks, before the market decides between a continued bear trend or a resumption of last year’s bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to far below yesterday’s low. This triggered a parabolic wedge sell signal on the daily chart. The selloff should reach the January 1 low at around 1.20 over the next several days.<p>While the overnight selloff has not yet been particularly strong, the pullbacks have been small. Day traders have only been selling.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways for a month and today’s range is about average. Also, the overnight selloff has not had consecutive big bear bars and therefore is not very strong. Therefore, there may not be much left to the selloff. But until there is a 20- to 30-pip bounce, day traders will only sell. Once there is a bounce, day traders will expect the bear trend to evolve into a trading range. At that point, they will also look to buy reversals up from the low for scalps.<p>Can today reverse back up to the high? Yes, but it is more likely that it will be sideways to down. This is because the parabolic wedge top on the daily chart should lead to a few days down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-trading-range-and-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-12-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

While this week reversed up, the selloff is still in the tight trading range. Traders will expect sideways to down trading until the bulls can create a couple consecutive strong bull bars.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h3 id=\"2-bond-futures-weekly-chart-reversing-up-from-bottom-of-bull-channel\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart reversing up from bottom of bull channel</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-13.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p>The bond futures market has been trending down since the March 2020 buy climax. That was the most extreme buy climax in history, and it will probably remain the high for at least a couple decades, and maybe for your entire trading career. What about all those experts on TV last year saying interest rates would go to zero? I said back then that they were fools, and the market is validating that opinion now.<p>This week was a 2nd consecutive bear bar closing on its low. That increases the chance of at least slightly lower prices next week.<p>Also, the bond market is near enough to important magnets below, that it might not be able to escape their magnetic pull. The first is the March 18 major higher low. Just below that is the August 2019 high. That is the breakout point of the early 2020 blow-off top.<p>However, once the bond market reaches these support levels, many bears will begin to take profits. That typically will at least pause the bear trend.<p>Because the selloff has been in a tight bear channel for a long time, it is a sell climax. Therefore, if there is profit taking, there could be a rally for a month or more.<p>However, when a Small Pullback Bear Trend reverses up, the 1st reversal up is typically minor. Traders will look to sell it, expecting at least a test of the sell climax low. They would prefer a resumption of the bear trend, and for the market to collapse down to the January 2020 low, at the start of last year’s buy climax. But it is more likely that the bond market will pause for a few weeks around the magnets.<h2 id=\"3-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h3 id=\"4-eurusd-weekly-chart-in-middle-of-9-week-tight-trading-range\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart in middle of 9-week tight trading range</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-wedge-bull-flag-after-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-13-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has weak wedge bull flag after wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart totally reversed last week’s selloff. While last week broke below an 8-week trading range, I said the the breakout was weak, because the bear bar closed in its middle instead of on its low, and above the January 1 bottom of the trading range. That is why I said that this week was likely to be sideways, and it was.<p>There is now a 2-bar reversal. This week is therefore a buy signal bar. However, this week broke above a 5-bar bear micro channel (the past 4 bars had highs below the high of the prior bar). That is a sign of persistent bears. Also, the EURUSD is back in the middle of its now 9-week tight trading range. Finally, this week did not close on its high or above last week’s high. These factors reduce the probability that this week is a resumption of the bull trend that began last March.<p>We will find out next week. If next week is a big bull bar closing on its high, there will then be consecutive strong bull bars. Traders will assume that the bull trend is resuming.<h3 id=\"5-what-is-likely-next-week\">What is likely next week?</h3><p>The EURUSD is back in its tight trading range. It is therefore more likely to go sideways than strongly up next week. If next week goes above this week’s high, which would trigger a buy signal, the bulls will probably be disappointed by the bar. It might close below its middle. Or, it could even have a bear body instead of being a big bull bar closing on its high. Anything other than a strong bull bar would make traders think that the trading range will continue.<p>If next week is a big bear bar, traders will wonder if the 6-week selloff is the start of an Endless Pullback. Remember, the January high formed a wedge top. A reversal down often has at least a couple legs, and tests the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the November 4 low at 1.16.<p>What is most likely? Markets have inertia. They tend to continue what they have been doing. The EURUSD has been going sideways for 9 weeks. Therefore, it will probably not break strongly up or down next week. More likely, it will stay within the 9-week trading range, and not be particularly bullish or bearish.<h3 id=\"6-what-about-the-next-6-months\">What about the next 6 months?</h3><p>What about over the next few months? There is a credible wedge top on the weekly chart. Traders should expect a selloff to the bottom of the 3rd leg up. That is the November 4 low.<p>However, the 2nd leg up in the wedge to the September 4 high was strong. It might have started the count over again. If the EURUSD breaks above the January 6 high but reverses down, there would then be a new wedge top where September 4 was the 1st leg up.<p>Can the TV bulls be right? Can the EURUSD rally 20% from here this year? The chart does not look like it will. The current wedge should lead to sideways to down trading for at least a couple months. But if there is a new high, it will probably reverse down from a new wedge, and the reversal will still likely last at least a couple months and test the November 4 low at 1.16.<h2 id=\"7-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h3 id=\"8-monthly-emini-chart-has-big-bull-bar-in-strong-bull-trend\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has big bull bar in strong bull trend</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-strong-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini SP500 futures monthly candlestick chart in strong bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is forming a big bull bar so far in February – a buy climax testing top of bull channel. The yearlong bull trend has been extremely strong. Everyone knows it is climactic, but that is irrelevant. Traders will continue to buy until there is a clear reversal down.<p>There has been only one pullback since the rally began a year ago. That was when September traded below the August low. And what happened next? The bulls bought it and the bull trend resumed. In a strong bull trend, the bulls are quick to buy anything that is bearish, betting that the reversal down will fail, and that the bull trend will soon resume.<p>In a micro channel (no pullbacks), many bulls are eager for a pullback so they can buy below the low of a bar, instead of above the prior month’s low. When traders are desperate for a pullback, the pullback takes a long time before it arrives.<p>This is because traders are confident of one of two things happening if they buy. Either the market will go up and they will make money. Or, it will go down briefly and allow them to buy more, and it will then go up, and they will make money. As long as traders think this way, a rally can last a long time between pullbacks.<h3 id=\"9-is-there-a-bear-case\">Is there a bear case?</h3><p>There is always a bear case, even in a strong bull trend. When there is a reversal, it can be fast and go a long way, like last February and March. Therefore, traders need to be prepared.<p>This month is the 3rd push up from last February’s low. If this month is a strong bull bar, and March is a bear bar, there would be a parabolic wedge buy climax top. That typically will attract profit takers. Traders would then look for a couple legs down. The selloff often reaches the start of the parabolic wedge, which is the September low.<p>The September low is around a 20% pullback, and at the moment that much of a pullback is unlikely. More likely, if there is a pullback within a few months, many traders will eagerly buy at around 10% down from the high. That buying should prevent a 20% pullback during the 1st reversal down. But if a reversal up from a 10% pullback leads to a trading range instead of a resumption of the bull trend, then the odds of a test of the September low will go up.<h3 id=\"10-marchapril-tend-to-be-up\">March/April tend to be up</h3><p>I have one final thought. If you look at any pair of consecutive months, March/April is the most bullish. Historically, the market is strongest from October into May. You often hear, “Sell in May and go away.” That is consistent with traders taking profits after a strong rally through April.<p>Sometimes a market pulls back just ahead of a strong period. If February sells off in the 2nd half of the month, it might simply be setting up a strong March/April.<p>I never take calendar trades because there is usually no way to structure a trade with a mathematical advantage. There are almost always many other ways to invest your money. However, I mention this as a reminder that March/April tends to be strong. Therefore, it is another reason to think that traders will buy if there is a 10% selloff into early March.<h3 id=\"11-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-formed-small-bull-follow-through-bar-after-last-weeks-big-bull-bar\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed small bull follow-through bar after last week’s big bull bar</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-stock-index-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-bull-channel-in-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-13-3.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a small bull bar this week after last week’s big bull bar. This is good follow-through and increases the chance of higher prices next week. In fact, next week might gap up to a new all-time high, like this week did. But if the gap is small, like this week’s, it typically closes before the end of the week. This week’s gap closed in the 3rd hour on Monday.<p>This week is the 14th week in a tight bull channel. That is unsustainable and therefore a buy climax, but a buy climax can last much longer than what you might think is reasonable. While the Emini is at the top of a 2-year bull channel and a 14-week bull channel, there is no sign of a top.<p>Can the Emini break strongly above the bull channels, and form another breakout phase, leading to an even stronger bull trend? When a market is at the top of a bull channel, there is a 75% chance that it will reverse within about 5 bars. There is only a 25% chance of a strong breakout into an even stronger bull trend. But 25% is not zero, and therefore the bulls will keep buying until there is a reversal.<p>Once there is a reversal down, the bears need it to be strong. There have been many bear bars since the tight bull channel began in early November, and the bulls bought every one. Until there are a couple consecutive strong bear bars, traders will bet that the tight bull channel will continue, even though it is overbought.<h3 id=\"12-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-testing-top-of-4-month-bull-channel\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart testing top of 4-month bull channel</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-stock-index-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-testing-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-13-4.png\" alt=\"Emini SP500 stock index futures daily candlestick chart buy climax testing top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied strongly since those 2 big bear bars formed 3 weeks ago. The bulls are creating a buy vacuum up to the 4,000 Big Round Number. Even if it breaks above it, it will probably not get far above before there is a 10% pullback. This is because the rally is getting extreme, and extreme rallies eventually attract profit takers.<p>However, traders continue to buy, betting on higher prices. As a general rule, if a market tries hard to do something 2 or 3 times and fails, it tends to do the opposite. That is the basis of double tops and bottoms and wedge tops and bottoms. And it is the reason why the 2-week rally has been so strong. The bears gave it their best shot twice and failed. They have been buying in a panic since then.<p>The Emini is again at the top of its bull channel. There is a 25% chance of a strong breakout above the channel and an acceleration up. But 75% of breakouts of channels fail within about 5 bars. Therefore, if next week rallies strongly, the week after will probably begin to turn down.<p>I want to explain something that I continue to write. That is that the bulls will continue to buy every strong bear bar, until there are consecutive strong bear bars. There have not been consecutive strong bear bars since just after the October buy climax. Those led to a 10% correction, Before that, they came after the September 2 buy climax.<p>The same is true for selloffs. Look at the pandemic crash last year. The bulls had consecutive big bull bars on February 28 and March 2, but they followed 6 bear bars. That made the reversal up likely to be minor. After that, the next time that the bulls had consecutive bull bars where the 2nd day was higher was just after the March 23 bottom of the selloff.<p>Reversals that come with consecutive strong bars are more likely to have a couple legs and last 10 or more bars. Without that, the reversals usually fail within a few bars.<h2 id=\"13-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Friday closed on its high and at a new all-time high, That increased the chance of a gap up this week on the weekly chart. While yesterday was a short day because of the holiday, it did gap up above last week’s high.<p>But the gap on the weekly chart is small. Small gaps usually close before the bar closes, which means before the end of the week. Also, the day after a small day has an increased chance of beginning an outside up, or outside down day.<p>The daily chart is in a strong bull trend, and it has been accelerating up for 2 weeks. That creates a parabolic wedge buy climax, and it increases the chance of a deeper pullback, like after the buy climaxes that ended on September 2 and October 12.<p>It is important to note that buy climaxes can go much higher than what seems likely. There is no sign of a top. Traders will continue to expect higher prices until the bears get consecutive big bear bars on the daily chart. Even then, traders will still look to buy after a couple weeks down. However, the odds of a 10% correction beginning soon are increasing.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Some computers are ignoring yesterday’s trading because the stock market was closed yesterday. While today is currently down about 5 points from yesterday’s close it is up 14 points from Friday’s close.<p>Most day traders will see yesterday’s bars on their day session charts. It is usually best to trade the chart in front of you, and not spend time wondering if more computers will ignore yesterday. Since I see yesterday on my day session chart, I am treating yesterday like any other day.<p>Today is currently just a few points below yesterday’s low. If today gaps down, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps usually close in the 1st hour.<p>If there is a gap down and it stays open, yesterday will be a 1-day island top in an extreme buy climax on the daily chart. Because there is a growing chance of a 10% correction, there is an increased chance of a couple consecutive big bear days coming soon. But until then, traders will continue to expect every selloff to be a buying opportunity.<p>Friday’s buy climax was extreme. Bull trends frequently end with an extreme buy climax on the 5-minute chart. It often takes a few days before traders decide if the trend is ending. Therefore, there is an increased chance that today will continue yesterday’s trading range trading.<p>Can today resume up to above 4,000? That is what this 2-week rally is about. Yes, it can, but because the Emini is so overbought, there is a 50% chance of a 10% correction beginning from around here, or from just above 4,000.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-trading-range-and-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-16.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range and late bull breakout. Buy climax accelerating up.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from last Friday (pre-holiday). I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-rally-to-double-top-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex wedge rally to double top lower high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied for a couple weeks. The bulls want the rally to break strongly above the January 22 lower high, and then above the January 6 high. But the past 5 days have had small bodies, which represents a loss of momentum. It is more likely that the EURUSD will sell off for at least a few days. Since there are not 3 clear legs up on the daily chart, the rally might reach the January 22 lower high before the leg down begins.<p>While the rally is not strong, it is strong enough so that many bulls will buy about a 50% retracement, or around the February 5 low. Therefore, the 1st reversal down will probably bounce after a few days.<h3>Weekly and monthly charts are important</h3><p>Traders are deciding if the 3-month trading range is just a protracted bull flag in last year’s bull trend on the daily chart. There is a consensus on TV that it is.<p>However, there is also a clear wedge top on the weekly chart, and a double top on the monthly chart, and the TV experts are completely missing the reality that higher time frames are important. While the odds favor higher prices after last year’s good bottom on the monthly chart, it is currently more likely that the weekly chart will test 1.16 before there is a strong break above the 6-year trading range on the monthly chart.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied above last week’s high, and then sold off sharply over the past hour. The selloff is strong enough so that day traders are now only selling. Traders are wondering if today will be the end of the 2-week rally.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways for 5 days, and this selloff is still within the trading range. If the bulls can stop the selling and create a trading range, day traders will also look to buy reversals up for scalps. But at the moment, it is likely that the EURUSD will be sideways to down for the rest of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-double-top-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double top and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After a Spike and Channel down to a measured move, it reversed up from a wedge bottom. It then went sideways.<p>Today was a bear bar on the daily chart. Since late October, the bulls have bought the day after a bear day. But because the Emini is at the top of bull channels on the daily and weekly charts and is extremely overbought, the odds favor a 10% correction beginning soon. If tomorrow is a 2nd consecutive bear day and if it is big, traders will conclude that the Emini will pull back for at least a couple weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls want the rally to break strongly above the January 22 lower high, and then above the January 6 high. But the past 5 days have had small bodies, which represents a loss of momentum. It is more likely that the EURUSD will sell off for at least a few days. Since there are not 3 clear legs up on the daily chart, the rally might reach the January 22 lower high before the leg down begins.<p>While the rally is not strong, it is strong enough so that many bulls will buy about a 50% retracement, or around the February 5 low. Therefore, the 1st reversal down will probably bounce after a few days.<h3>Weekly and monthly charts are important</h3><p>Traders are deciding if the 3-month trading range is just a protracted bull flag in last year’s bull trend on the daily chart. There is a consensus on TV that it is.<p>However, there is also a clear wedge top on the weekly chart, and a double top on the monthly chart, and the TV experts are completely missing the reality that higher time frames are important. While the odds favor higher prices after last year’s good bottom on the monthly chart, it is currently more likely that the weekly chart will test 1.16 before there is a strong break above the 6-year trading range on the monthly chart.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied above last week’s high, and then sold off sharply over the past hour. The selloff is strong enough so that day traders are now only selling. Traders are wondering if today will be the end of the 2-week rally.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways for 5 days, and this selloff is still within the trading range. If the bulls can stop the selling and create a trading range, day traders will also look to buy reversals up for scalps. But at the moment, it is likely that the EURUSD will be sideways to down for the rest of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-double-top-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double top and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After a Spike and Channel down to a measured move, it reversed up from a wedge bottom. It then went sideways.<p>Today was a bear bar on the daily chart. Since late October, the bulls have bought the day after a bear day. But because the Emini is at the top of bull channels on the daily and weekly charts and is extremely overbought, the odds favor a 10% correction beginning soon. If tomorrow is a 2nd consecutive bear day and if it is big, traders will conclude that the Emini will pull back for at least a couple weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It closed the gaps and was a bear day. Bears want an Emini mid-February reversal. Although it closed near the low, the 3-week bull channel has been tight. This is therefore a relatively weak sell setup.<p>It is important to note that we are in the middle of February. February is a big bull bar on the monthly chart, but it might not look that way when the month closes. Traders watch for reversals in the 2nd half of all bars, on all time frames. Most bull bars do not close on their highs. Therefore, the odds favor at least a small pullback by the end of the month.<p>The Emini is extremely overbought, and at the top of bull channels on the daily and weekly charts. This increases the chance of a 10% correction starting soon.<p>However, until there are consecutive big bear bodies on the daily chart, traders will continue to buy every brief selloff. But if today is a 2nd consecutive bear day, and if it closes near its low and has a big bear body, there would then be consecutive strong bear days. That would be the 1st time since the 10% corrections in September and October, and it would increase the chance that another 10% correction is beginning.<p>Is that likely? As I keep saying, until there are consecutive strong bear days, traders will buy every reversal down, and bet against consecutive big bear bars forming. That means it is more likely that today will not be a big bear day closing near its low, even though a correction will probably begin soon. But if it is, the probability shifts in favor of the bears for a few weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 7 points on the Globex chart. Today will therefore probably open near yesterday’s low. If today gaps down, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>If today trades below yesterday’s low, it will trigger a sell signal on the daily chart. On the 60-minute Globex chart (not shown), there is a clear triangle at 3,900. That is a strong magnet because it is a good candidate for a Final Bull Flag on that chart. The Emini should get there today.<p>Because the daily chart is so overbought, a big bear trend day can come at any time. Strong bear trends constantly form bull trend reversal bars. Most fail and become bear flags. If today forms a Small Pullback Bear Trend, it is better to focus on selling, despite the likely repeated reversal attempts.<p>Can today be a bull trend day? The 3-week rally has been strong, and the 4,000 Big Round Number is a magnet above. A big bull trend day can come at any time.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-double-top-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-17.png\" alt=\"Emini double top and then trading range.

There are 3 ways to draw the wedge and I chose one.<p>This is a lower high major trend reversal, and the sell signal triggered when today fell below yesterday’s low. The rally is a parabolic wedge, which increases the chance of at least slightly lower prices for a few days.<p>The bears are hoping that this is a resumption of the bear trend that began in January. I have been saying repeatedly in my weekend blogs that there is a clear wedge top on the weekly chart, and it should lead to a test of 1.16.<p>However, the daily chart has been in a trading range for 3 months, and trading ranges can last a very long time. Therefore picking the resumption of the bear trend is not a very high probability bet. Most attempts to break out of the range will fail, even though it is more likely that the ultimate breakout will be down. This is despite all of the TV experts saying that the dollar is going a lot lower. It might later in the year, but that is not imminent, and it is not at all clear on the weekly and monthly charts.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been trending down overnight in a bear channel, after yesterday’s strong bear breakout (spike down). The 2-day selloff is a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. Traders should expect the channel to evolve into a trading range today or tomorrow.<p>While the channel could last all day, the momentum down has not been strong for the past several hours. Also, the selloff is near the support of a 50% retracement of the February rally and the January 1 low. Finally, today’s range is already big, which means it probably will not get much bigger.<p>Because the channel down has been tight, day traders have only been selling. But if there is a 20- to 30-pip rally, that would be a sign that exhausted bears are taking some profits. That would probably be the start of a trading range. At that point, day traders will begin to look to buy reversals up for scalps. However, they will continue to sell unless there is a strong bull trend reversal today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-wedge-double-bottom-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double bottom and higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

On the 60-minute Globex chart (not shown), there is a clear triangle at 3,900. That is a strong magnet because it is a good candidate for a Final Bull Flag on that chart. The Emini should get there today.<p>Because the daily chart is so overbought, a big bear trend day can come at any time. Strong bear trends constantly form bull trend reversal bars. Most fail and become bear flags. If today forms a Small Pullback Bear Trend, it is better to focus on selling, despite the likely repeated reversal attempts.<p>Can today be a bull trend day? The 3-week rally has been strong, and the 4,000 Big Round Number is a magnet above. A big bull trend day can come at any time.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-double-top-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-17.png\" alt=\"Emini double top and then trading range.

There are 3 ways to draw the wedge and I chose one.<p>This is a lower high major trend reversal, and the sell signal triggered when today fell below yesterday’s low. The rally is a parabolic wedge, which increases the chance of at least slightly lower prices for a few days.<p>The bears are hoping that this is a resumption of the bear trend that began in January. I have been saying repeatedly in my weekend blogs that there is a clear wedge top on the weekly chart, and it should lead to a test of 1.16.<p>However, the daily chart has been in a trading range for 3 months, and trading ranges can last a very long time. Therefore picking the resumption of the bear trend is not a very high probability bet. Most attempts to break out of the range will fail, even though it is more likely that the ultimate breakout will be down. This is despite all of the TV experts saying that the dollar is going a lot lower. It might later in the year, but that is not imminent, and it is not at all clear on the weekly and monthly charts.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been trending down overnight in a bear channel, after yesterday’s strong bear breakout (spike down). The 2-day selloff is a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. Traders should expect the channel to evolve into a trading range today or tomorrow.<p>While the channel could last all day, the momentum down has not been strong for the past several hours. Also, the selloff is near the support of a 50% retracement of the February rally and the January 1 low. Finally, today’s range is already big, which means it probably will not get much bigger.<p>Because the channel down has been tight, day traders have only been selling. But if there is a 20- to 30-pip rally, that would be a sign that exhausted bears are taking some profits. That would probably be the start of a trading range. At that point, day traders will begin to look to buy reversals up for scalps. However, they will continue to sell unless there is a strong bull trend reversal today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-wedge-double-bottom-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double bottom and higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But it then rallied from a double bottom higher low major trend reversal for the rest of the day.<p>Today was a bull bar on the daily chart, and it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. The bulls are still trying to break above the 4,000 Big Round Number before there is more than a brief pullback. The bears see that the daily chart is overbought, but until there are consecutive big bear bars, traders will continue to buy every pullback, like today.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bears want a mid-month reversal and for February to close below the open of the month. However, the bulls bought the sell signal, and yesterday became a bull day that closed near its high. It is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today, a February buy climax.<p>The bulls want the yearlong rally to continue to above the 4,000 Big Round Number. But the Emini is at the top of a 7-day tight trading range. Also, because the rally is climactic and at the top of channels on the daily and weekly chart, traders know that a 10% correction can come at any time. I continue to repeat that traders will continue to buy every 2- to 3-day reversal down until there are consecutive big bear bars on the daily chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 24 points in the Globex session. It is again testing the 3,900 Big Round Number and the bottom of the 7-day trading range.<p>Today will gap far below yesterday’s close and it might gap below yesterday’s low. If it does gap below yesterday’s low, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>Because of the extreme buy climax on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts, everyone knows that a 10% reversal can begin at any time. That will probably begin with a couple big bear trend days. If there is a series of strong bear bars in the 1st hour, there will be an increased chance of a bear trend day today.<p>If today is a big bear day, there will be many buy signal bars on the way down. Strong trends are always forming reversal patterns to trap bears out of good shorts, and bulls into bad longs. Day traders should either rely on stops above the top of the most recent leg down, or continue to sell again below a bear bar after each 1- to 3-bar reversal up.<p>Can today be a bull trend day? Any day can be a trend day in either direction. But with yesterday being a buy signal bar on the daily chart, and today opening near yesterday’s low instead of near its high, the chance of a strong bull day today is less.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-wedge-double-bottom-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-18.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double bottom and higher low major trend reversal in February buy climax.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is therefore in Breakout Mode.<p>Every trading range always has both a reasonable buy and sell setup. The bulls see today as a reversal up from the right shoulder of a Head and Shoulders Bottom bull flag. They need consecutive closes above the January 22 neckline.<p>For the bears, today is a pullback from yesterday’s reversal down from a double top bear flag. They need consecutive closes below the February 5 neckline.<p>So which side will win? The EURUSD could not be in a trading range if either side had a significant advantage. The bulls have an edge for a few days, and then the bears have the edge for a few days. Neither side so far is strong enough to create a sustained move. Traders will continue to look for reversals until there is a clear breakout.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight, and the rally has reversed more than half of yesterday’s selloff. The rally has been strong enough for day traders to only be buying.<p>However, it has had a couple trading ranges that lasted more than an hour. That reduces the chance that the rally will continue all day.<p>But until there is at least a 20-pip pullback, day traders will only buy. Once there is a 20-pip pullback, day traders will expect the bull trend to evolve into a trading range. At that point, they will also be willing to sell reversals down for 10-pip scalps, in addition to buying pullbacks for scalps. Neither a big reversal down or a significant additional rally are likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-after-gap-down-then-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom after gap down then higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The reversal prevented this week from becoming an outside down bar on the weekly chart.<p>After going sideways for a couple hours, it rallied from a higher low major trend reversal. It stalled at the 60-minute EMA at the end of the day.<p>Today is a bull bar on the daily chart. It is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. But since the Emini has been in a tight trading range for 8 days, there might be more sellers than buyers above its high.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want the week to close above last week’s high at a new all-time high.<p>However, the bears want the week to close on its low and below last week’s low. It would then be an outside down bar on the weekly chart, which would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Day traders should either rely on stops above the top of the most recent leg down, or continue to sell again below a bear bar after each 1- to 3-bar reversal up.<p>Can today be a bull trend day? Any day can be a trend day in either direction. But with yesterday being a buy signal bar on the daily chart, and today opening near yesterday’s low instead of near its high, the chance of a strong bull day today is less.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-wedge-double-bottom-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-18.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double bottom and higher low major trend reversal in February buy climax.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-bottom-bull-flag-and-double-top-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-18-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex head and shoulders bottom bull flag and double top bear flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been in a trading range since mid-January. It is therefore in Breakout Mode.<p>Every trading range always has both a reasonable buy and sell setup. The bulls see today as a reversal up from the right shoulder of a Head and Shoulders Bottom bull flag. They need consecutive closes above the January 22 neckline.<p>For the bears, today is a pullback from yesterday’s reversal down from a double top bear flag. They need consecutive closes below the February 5 neckline.<p>So which side will win? The EURUSD could not be in a trading range if either side had a significant advantage. The bulls have an edge for a few days, and then the bears have the edge for a few days. Neither side so far is strong enough to create a sustained move. Traders will continue to look for reversals until there is a clear breakout.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight, and the rally has reversed more than half of yesterday’s selloff. The rally has been strong enough for day traders to only be buying.<p>However, it has had a couple trading ranges that lasted more than an hour. That reduces the chance that the rally will continue all day.<p>But until there is at least a 20-pip pullback, day traders will only buy. Once there is a 20-pip pullback, day traders will expect the bull trend to evolve into a trading range. At that point, they will also be willing to sell reversals down for 10-pip scalps, in addition to buying pullbacks for scalps. Neither a big reversal down or a significant additional rally are likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-after-gap-down-then-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom after gap down then higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The reversal prevented this week from becoming an outside down bar on the weekly chart.<p>After going sideways for a couple hours, it rallied from a higher low major trend reversal. It stalled at the 60-minute EMA at the end of the day.<p>Today is a bull bar on the daily chart. It is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. But since the Emini has been in a tight trading range for 8 days, there might be more sellers than buyers above its high.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want the week to close above last week’s high at a new all-time high.<p>However, the bears want the week to close on its low and below last week’s low. It would then be an outside down bar on the weekly chart, which would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This prevented the week from being an outside down bar on the weekly chart. It also increases the chance that today might try to test last week’s high.<p>The Emini formed a bull bar on the daily chart, and it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. But the Emini has been in a tight trading range for 8 days. That lowers the probability of a big bull day today.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. If the week closes on the high and above last week’s high, traders will expect higher prices next week. If the week closes below last week’s low, the week will be an outside down bar on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session so it will probably gap up on the open. The past 2 weeks gapped up on the weekly chart, even though both gaps quickly closed. If the Emini closes near the high of the day, it would increase the chance of a gap up again next week. The bulls would like today to close at a new all-time high. That would further increase the chance of higher prices on Monday.<p>Can the Emini reverse down and form a bear day today? It might since it will open near the top of an 8-day tight trading range.<p>With the Emini being sideways for 8 days, there is a reduced chance of a strong trend day today. However, if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the 1st hour, the odds of a trend day will go up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-after-gap-down-then-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-19.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom after gap down then higher low major trend reversal.

Six days ago, I said that the rally would correct down to around the January 1 low and then have a 2nd leg sideways to up. This is that leg.<p>What traders will find out over the next week, is whether this rally will reach the January 6 high at the top of the 3-month trading range, or reverse down to the February 5 low at the bottom. Trading ranges are neutral. They are bullish for a few days, and then bearish for a few days, but most breakout attempts fail.<p>They always eventually break out, but betting that any one leg will grow into a successful breakout is a low probability wager. Traders continue to buy low, sell high, and take quick profits until there are consecutive closes above or below the range. They then switch to trend trading.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight. It broke above yesterday’s high, which triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart.<p>Because the rally has been strong, day traders have only been buying. However, it has been sideways for several hours, which means that bulls are starting to take profits on tests of the most recent high.<p>The trading range is less than 20 pips tall. That makes it difficult for day traders to make money selling. However, with the many reversals down over the past few hours, some day traders are beginning to sell. It is usually better not to sell until after there has been at least a 20- to 30-pip pullback. That is because a day trader typically needs that much of a selloff to make a minimum scalp, which is 10 pips.<p>This is Friday, and the EURUSD is back at the open of the week. This week is therefore a perfect doji bar on the weekly chart, and the chart has been sideways for 3 weeks. With the overnight rally stalling at the open of the week, there is an increased chance that the day will stay sideways, and the week will close near the open.<p>Can the rally resume and break above the February 16 lower high? Yes, but it probably will not.<p>Can today reverse down and close near the low of the day, creating a triangle on the daily chart? A reversal down is less likely when a rally is as strong as the overnight rally has been.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-19-2.png\" alt=\"\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bull breakout failed and the Emini sold off to below the midpoint of the week. It then formed another trading range, and today was a bear trending trading range day. Because it closed below the midpoint of the week, it slightly increases the chance of lower prices next week.<p>The Emini has now been in a tight trading range for 9 days. That makes more sideways trading likely on Monday. Traders are deciding if the bulls will get a break above 4,000 or take profits, which could lead to a 10% correction. Until there are consecutive strong bear days, the odds favor higher prices, despite the extreme buy climax.<p>Next week is the final week of the month. The bulls want the month to end of the high, which would increase the chance of higher prices in March. The bears, however, want a selloff into the end of the month because that would increase the chance of lower prices in March.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Six days ago, I said that the rally would correct down to around the January 1 low and then have a 2nd leg sideways to up. This is that leg.<p>What traders will find out over the next week, is whether this rally will reach the January 6 high at the top of the 3-month trading range, or reverse down to the February 5 low at the bottom. Trading ranges are neutral. They are bullish for a few days, and then bearish for a few days, but most breakout attempts fail.<p>They always eventually break out, but betting that any one leg will grow into a successful breakout is a low probability wager. Traders continue to buy low, sell high, and take quick profits until there are consecutive closes above or below the range. They then switch to trend trading.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight. It broke above yesterday’s high, which triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart.<p>Because the rally has been strong, day traders have only been buying. However, it has been sideways for several hours, which means that bulls are starting to take profits on tests of the most recent high.<p>The trading range is less than 20 pips tall. That makes it difficult for day traders to make money selling. However, with the many reversals down over the past few hours, some day traders are beginning to sell. It is usually better not to sell until after there has been at least a 20- to 30-pip pullback. That is because a day trader typically needs that much of a selloff to make a minimum scalp, which is 10 pips.<p>This is Friday, and the EURUSD is back at the open of the week. This week is therefore a perfect doji bar on the weekly chart, and the chart has been sideways for 3 weeks. With the overnight rally stalling at the open of the week, there is an increased chance that the day will stay sideways, and the week will close near the open.<p>Can the rally resume and break above the February 16 lower high? Yes, but it probably will not.<p>Can today reverse down and close near the low of the day, creating a triangle on the daily chart? A reversal down is less likely when a rally is as strong as the overnight rally has been.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-19-2.png\" alt=\"\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective.

The bull breakout failed and the Emini sold off to below the midpoint of the week. It then formed another trading range, and today was a bear trending trading range day. Because it closed below the midpoint of the week, it slightly increases the chance of lower prices next week.<p>The Emini has now been in a tight trading range for 9 days. That makes more sideways trading likely on Monday. Traders are deciding if the bulls will get a break above 4,000 or take profits, which could lead to a 10% correction. Until there are consecutive strong bear days, the odds favor higher prices, despite the extreme buy climax.<p>Next week is the final week of the month. The bulls want the month to end of the high, which would increase the chance of higher prices in March. The bears, however, want a selloff into the end of the month because that would increase the chance of lower prices in March.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders will continue to buy 1- to 3- day pullbacks until there are consecutive big bear days. They then will wait for a 10% correction before buying again.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are accelerating down in a parabolic wedge sell climax. They are testing important support so there could be a bounce soon.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market reversed down from a wedge top on the weekly chart, but the reversal is sideways instead of down. There might be one more push up before the EURUSD corrects down to the November low at 1.16.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures\">30-year Treasury Bond futures</h2><h3 id=\"2-bond-futures-weekly-chart-collapsing-down-to-support\">Bond futures<em>weekly</em>chart collapsing down to support</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-parabolic-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-20.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in parabolic sell climax\"></a></figure><p>Bond futures have been in a bear trend for a year, and they have been accelerating down on the weekly chart for 2 months. This week, they broke below the March 18 low, which was the bottom of the reversal down from the most extreme buy climax in history. Additionally, they dipped below the support of the August 28, 2019 high. That was the breakout point for last year’s extreme buy climax.<p>They also broke below the bear channel from the August 28 low. However, most breakouts below bear channels fail within about 5 bars. Therefore, traders should expect several weeks of sideways to up trading to begin before the end of March.<h3 id=\"3-sell-climax-near-support-so-bounce-soon\">Sell climax near support so bounce soon</h3><p>In addition to bears taking profits soon, some bulls will buy. They are taking the low probability bet that the yearlong selloff is just a sell vacuum test of the August 2019 high. In a bear trend, a trader will make more money selling than buying. Bonds are going lower, next year, in 5 years, and in 10 years.<p>I have been saying for several years, that the bond market would probably put in a top that will last for a couple decades, and last year’s buy climax is a good candidate for that top. Also, the yearlong selloff from that high is consistent with the end of the 30-year bull trend.<h3 id=\"4-are-bonds-in-a-bear-trend-or-a-trading-range\">Are bonds in a bear trend or a trading range?</h3><p>It is common for a trend to end, and then transition into a trading range instead of reversing into a bear trend. That is what the bulls are hoping is the case here. They want the selloff from the August high, to be a bear leg in what will become a trading range. They then want a bull leg back up to the top of the trading range.<p>It is important to note that the selloff from the August high has been in a bear channel. I said that most breaks below bear channels fail. Most of the time, there is ultimately a bull breakout. That is why I say that bear channels are bull flags. Traders should expect a break above the bear trend line at some point. However, a break above a strong bear channel usually leads to a trading range and not a bull trend. This bear trend will last many years so every rally, no matter how strong, will be followed by a new low.<h3 id=\"5-how-much-lower-will-sell-climax-go-before-bears-take-profits\">How much lower will sell climax go before bears take profits?</h3><p>What should traders expect over the next couple months? The next target below is the measured move from last year’s April/August double top. The most important target is the January 2020 low, which was the start of the most extreme buy climax in history. The bond market should reach that low because it is in a bear trend after an extreme buy climax. But the current sell climax is extreme. There could be a sharp short covering rally at any time before reaching that support. However, traders will sell rallies because they are confident that bonds will reach that target.<p>A sell climax at major support usually attracts profit taking. Therefore, bonds could stop going down, and go either sideways or up for many weeks starting by the end of March.<p>But even if they reverse up for many months, it is still more likely that they are in a bear trend, and that the trend will last for at least 10 years. I have been saying for a year that interest rates will be higher in 5 and 10 years, whether or not the bonds have a yearlong rally before then. Sell bonds.<h2 id=\"6-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"7-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-in-tight-trading-range-after-wedge-top\">EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart is in tight trading range after wedge top</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-tight-trading-range-after-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-20-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart tight trading range after wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart has had a weak reversal down from a wedge top in January. Traders are wondering if the 7-week selloff is a bull flag instead of the 1st leg down from a wedge top.<p>When a market is unclear, it goes sideways. Traders need more information, and they get it from seeing additional bars.<p>The yearlong bull channel was strong enough so the 7-week selloff will probably not grow into a bear trend. However, a reversal down from a wedge top typically has at least a couple legs, and it usually tests at least down to the bottom of the 3rd leg up.<p>So where is the confusion? This seems pretty clear. And it is. What is not clear is whether the 2nd leg up to the September high was so strong, that it started the count over again. Instead of a 2nd leg up from the March 2020 low, it could be a new 1st leg up. If it is, then the January high is only the 2nd leg up in a developing wedge, instead of the final leg up in a completed wedge.<p>If the reversal down had consecutive big bear bars closing on their lows, traders would conclude that January was in fact the top. But that is not what this selloff looks like. Each bar has largely overlapped the prior bar, and only one bar was a big bear bar closing near its low.<h3 id=\"8-what-will-the-eurusd-do-next-week\">What will the EURUSD do next week?</h3><p>So what is the probability for each possibility? At the moment, there is a 60% chance that January was the 3rd push up. That means this selloff should continue down to the November 4 low at 1.16.<p>It also means that there is a 40% chance that the 7-week selloff is a bull flag, and that there will be at least one more new high, before there is a 2-legged selloff down to a prior major higher low.<p>When traders are uncertain, they buy low, sell high, and take quick profits. That is what created the current 11-week trading range. With this week closing at its open, which is neutral, and with it being in the middle of a 3-week tight trading range, it increases the chance that next week will also be sideways. Traders need to see consecutive strong trend bars up or down, before they will conclude that a trend is underway.<h2 id=\"9-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"10-monthly-emini-chart-is-in-strong-bull-trend-but-this-3rd-push-up-is-possible-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax\"><em>Monthly</em>Emini chart is in strong bull trend, but this 3rd push up is possible parabolic wedge buy climax</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart in parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>So far, the S&amp;P500 Emini futures market in February is a big bull bar closing about the January high. There is still plenty of time for it to look very different once the month closes next week.<p>However, it is unlikely that the month will close near its low because that is very far below. At a minimum, the bears want the month to close below the January high. Traders would see that as a sign that the bulls are not as strong as they have been.<p>Furthermore, the bears would like the month to close in its lower half. Traders would see that as slightly bearish. It would increase the chance of sideways to down trading in March.<h3 id=\"11-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax\">Parabolic wedge buy climax</h3><p>The Emini on the monthly chart has rallied strongly for the past year. There are now 3 pushes up. A reversal down within the next couple months would therefore be from a parabolic wedge top.<p>However, a parabolic wedge rally with lots of big bull bars typically does not usually immediately reverse down into a bear trend. Traders expect the 1st reversal down to be minor. That means a month or two of sideways to down trading.<p>But a couple months down on the monthly chart could still fall a long way. Look at the 35% selloff last year in February and March.<p>Once there is a reversal this time, how far down should traders expect it to go? Probably about 10%. But there is no sign of a top yet on the monthly chart, and therefore the bulls continue to buy.<h3 id=\"12-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-sell-signal-for-failed-breakout-above-bull-channel\"><em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has sell signal for failed breakout above bull channel</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-possible-failed-breakout-above-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-20-3.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly chart has February sell signal with failed breakout above bull channel.\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart traded sideways this week, after last week’s breakout above a bull channel that began in May 2019. Most of the time, a breakout above a bull channel fails within about 5 bars. Traders should expect a reversal down at some point before the end of March.<p>This week closed on its low, and is therefore a sell signal bar for next week. Next week is also the end of the month, and strong rallies often have profit taking at the end of the month. This increases the chance of lower prices next week. Because the buy climax is so extreme, there is a 40% chance of next week forming a big bear bar on the weekly chart.<p>Also, if a swing down is beginning, traders should start to see bearish things. This includes big bear bars closing on their lows, and consecutive bear bars. This week gapped up, as did several weeks at the end of the year. If next week gaps down on the weekly chart, that would be a significant change in the market’s behavior. If it gaps down and closes on the low of the week, next week would be even more bearish.<p>But that does not mean a reversal into a bear trend. Strong bull trends often reverse down. For example, this one reversed down about 10% in September and again in October. The bull trend then resumed.<p>The Emini has been in a tight bull channel since November 10. While that is a buy climax, it is also a sign of strong bulls. They will be eager to buy a 2- to 4-week pullback once they get the chance. That makes it likely that a selloff will become a bull flag, and not a bear trend. But after such a protracted rally, it could last a couple months, like in September and October.<h3 id=\"13-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-is-stalling-at-the-top-of-its-bull-channel\"><em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is stalling at the top of its bull channel</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range-at-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-20-4.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The S&amp;P500 Emini futures daily chart formed a bear bar closing near its low on Friday. It is therefore a sell signal bar, in a buy climax, at the top of a bull channel. However, the bears need a couple consecutive big bear days, before traders will hold onto shorts for more than a day or two.<p>The Emini has rallied strongly in a tight bull channel since November 10. The bears were able to create many big bear bars, but the bulls bought each one. And they will continue to buy every reversal down, until there are consecutive big bear days closing near their lows.<p>That is what traders needed to see at the start of the 10% selloffs in September and October. And it is the opposite of what happened at the March 2020 pandemic low. The bulls needed to see a leg up that contained two big bull bars, before concluding that a reversal up was underway. Back then, there was a small bull bar in between the 2 big bull bars.<p>Everyone knows that the Small Pullback Bull Trend that began with the October low has lasted a long time. Trends don’t last forever so traders are expecting a pullback. But a trend can last much longer than what traders expect.<h3 id=\"14-forrest-gump-would-be-a-good-trader\">Forrest Gump would be a good trader</h3><p>I sometimes talk about the Forrest Gump approach to trading. This is an example. Traders don’t need to think too much. They will continue to buy every reversal down, until there are consecutive big bear bars. Then, they will expect a few weeks down.<p>How far down? The first targets are always about a 50% retracement of the most recent leg up, and a test of the breakout point. This rally broke above the January 26 high, and it is therefore a breakout point. If the selling continues, then traders will look for a test of the bottom of the most recent leg up. Currently, that is the January 29 low at 3,700.<p>When a buy climax lasts an extremely long time, like this one has, the selloff often retraces about half of the rally. That would be down to the November 10 low, which was the start of the bull channel. Another guideline is that it has about half as many bars as there were in the rally. Therefore, if there is is going to be a big selloff, it could last a couple months and fall more than 10%.<p>How likely is that? Right now, traders are buying all selloffs so it is not likely. But if there is a strong reversal down, the bears would have a 40% chance of it being big.<p>What about a bear trend? When traders talk about a bear trend, they mean a 20% selloff from the high. A strong bull trend does not usually reverse into a bear trend without 1<sup>st</sup>forming a trading range or a double top. Therefore, there is only a 30% chance that the 1st reversal down would grow into a bear trend on the daily chart.<h2 id=\"15-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

They still want this rally to break above the 4,000 Big Round Number, before there is a 10% correction. However, if the bears get a couple consecutive big bear days this week, the odds will favor a 10% correction before a break above 4,000.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 24 points in the Globex session. Most days have a trading range open. The bulls look for a double bottom or a wedge bottom in the first hour or two, for a possible low of the day. However, the bears look to sell a reversal down from a double top or wedge top near the EMA. The bears would also like to keep the gap open.<p>When there is a gap, there is an increased chance of a trend. The bigger a gap down is, the more likely that a trend would be down. The first several bars are important. If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, it will increase the chance that today will be a trend day.<p>Because the chance of a 10% correction is increasing, if today begins to trend, day traders should understand that the trend could be big. They therefore should look to swing at least part of their shorts.<p>Even if the Emini trades below last week’s low, and creates an outside down week, it could still reverse up. The 4,000 magnet above is powerful and the bull trend has been strong. Therefore, if there is a trend up, it could be big, and day traders should then swing part of their long positions.<p>Finally, remember that the Emini has been sideways for 9 days. Today could gap down and form a trading range open, and then continue sideways all day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-failed-breakout-above-triangle-and-then-Trending-Trading-Range-Day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-22.png\" alt=\"Emini gapping down and failed breakout above triangle and then Trending Trading Range Day.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-in-triangle-with-double-top-and-head-and-shoulders-bottom-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-22-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex in triangle with double top and head and shoulders bottom bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been in a trading range for 2 months. Friday’s tail on top is a small 3rd reversal down, and therefore the trading range is also a triangle. Additionally, this trading range is at the bottom of a 3-month trading range.<p>Every trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. Traders are deciding if the current wedge top on the weekly chart is complete, or if there will be one more leg up.<p>Every trading range has both a buy and sell setup. The bulls see a head and shoulders bottom bull flag. For the bears, there is a double top bear flag. But, until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. The chart alternates between being bullish and bearish every few days, but the probability that a successful breakout will be up or down, never gets far from 50%. Until there are consecutive closes above or below, traders will bet on reversals.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off and reversed up overnight. There is room to the trend line at the top of the triangle on the daily chart. That is a magnet above, that the rally might reach today.<p>The reversal up has been strong enough so that day traders have only been buying. When a reversal is as abrupt as this one has been, the day typically either goes sideways or up. Therefore, the best the bears will probably get today are small scalps. But until there is at least a 20-pip pullback, day traders should only buy.<p>Can today break far above the January 22 high today? Probably not. When a market has been sideways for a long time, it typically disappoints both bull and bears. While the bulls are happy to have a reversal up, they should expect that it will not grow into a huge bull trend day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This was likely to lead to a breakout in either direction and then a trending trading range day.<p>The bulls got the breakout and the rally went above Friday’s low to close he gap. At that point, the Emini was likely to enter a trading range. It sold off, but instead of forming a trading range, it totally reversed the rally. Today was a bear trend reversal day.<p>Traders should also understand that the Emini has been trending down for 5 days after a buy climax. While that might not seem important, this is the 1st 4-day pullback since the rally began at the end of October. This could be the start of an Endless Pullback. If it is, it could lead to a 10% correction before there is a break above 4,000.<p>Traders will conclude that a correction is underway after seeing consecutive big bear bars on the daily chart. Until then, they will continue to buy selloffs.

While yesterday was a bull doji, which is not bearish, it was the 5th day down from the all-time high. This is the 1st 5-day pullback since October, which is a sign that the bulls are more persistently taking profits. The market is becoming less bullish.<p>Today is the longest selloff since November. This selloff could be the start of an Endless Pullback. Charts have 2 variables, price and time. All bear trends need lower prices. Sometimes, early in a trend, time is more important than price. If the bears can control the market for enough days, even if there are no big bear days, it increases the chance that the bulls will give up.

If today has a bear body, it will be a sell signal bar. If they can break strongly below the February 5 low, the selloff should reach the November low of 1.16. But the rally is strong on the weekly chart. Traders will buy the selloff, and there should be a 2nd leg up to 1.25 at the top of the 6-year trading range.<p>The bulls want a breakout above the January 21 high, which is the neckline of the head and shoulders bottom bull flag.

The reversal down has been strong enough so that the bulls will probably not get a bull trend.<p>However, the bears do not need more than what they already have. They simply want a bear bar on the daily chart, so that traders will look for lower prices tomorrow. Therefore, there is not a strong incentive for the bear trend to continue a lot lower today. Also, after 3 bull days, the bears will probably not be able to get a big bear day.<p>So if today will probably not go up or down much, what is left? Sideways. Today will probably convert into a trading range and then traders will fight over the close. The bears want the day to close on the low, which would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow.<p>The bulls prefer a close above the open, but would be satisfied with a close in the middle third, even if there is a bear body. That would reduce the chance of a big bear day tomorrow. The bulls would then try again to break above the January 22 high late this week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-exhaustive-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini exhaustive sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The cash index reversed up from the 50-day MA. Is this just a bounce in a bear trend or a resumption of a bull trend? Traders need to see what happens today and tomorrow before deciding.<p>The Emini closed near its high. It is therefore a buy signal bar for today for a High 2 bull flag at support. If today is a big bull day, the rally will probably continue to above 4,000. If there is no follow-through buying today or tomorrow, traders will wonder if yesterday was just a bull trap in an early bear trend.<p>It is important to note that the Emini yesterday rallied strongly, but the rally stopped at the resistance of the 60-minute EMA, the 20-day EMA, the open of the week, and the January high. Was yesterday just a buy vacuum test of resistance in a new bear trend?<p>There is slightly better than a 50% chance of the rally continuing until the bears get consecutive big bear days. If they get that, the selloff should continue down to below 3,700 and possibly reach 10%.<p>This is the end of February, and the bulls want February to close above the January high. That would increase the chance of higher prices in March.<p>The bears want the week to close below the open. That would increase the chance of sideways to down trading next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 5 points in the Globex session. As strong as yesterday’s reversal up was, the bulls need strong follow-through buying today or tomorrow to convince traders that the bull trend is still intact. Without that, traders will wonder if a 10% correction is unfolding.<p>What is most likely? Yesterday reversed up from a cluster of support, but the rally stopped at a cluster of resistance. That is trading range price action, despite yesterday being a big bull day. It increases the chance of more trading range trading today. It also increases the chance of a trading range open for the 1st hour or two. Furthermore, it reduces the chance of today being a strong trend day in either direction. However, if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, the odds of a trend day will go up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-exhaustive-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-24.png\" alt=\"Emini exhaustive sell climax and bull trend reversal.

Additionally, there is always both a reasonable buy and sell setup.<p>The bulls hope the head and shoulders bottom will lead to a measured move up, and a breakout above the January high. The bears see a triangle, a Low 2 bear flag, or a double top bear flag, and they want a measured move down to the November low.<p>The 3-week rally is stalling at the top of the range. Traders are deciding if it will begin a leg down here or soon, or continue up to the next resistance at the January high. Yesterday was an unconvincing sell setup. It was a small bear day after 3 bull days. Today so far is sideways. Traders need more information, which means a better buy or sell setup, or a strong breakout up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low overnight, which triggered a minor sell signal. However, it has had several reversals, and it mostly has overlapped yesterday’s range. Day traders have been scalping the reversals. They will continue to do that today unless there are consecutive big trend bars breaking above or below yesterday’s range.<p>The location on the daily chart is good for a big trend day up or down, but the 2 small sideways days makes a continued trading range day more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If today is a bull trend day, it will probably be a weaker bull trend, like a trending trading range day, or a broad bull channel.<p>Since yesterday was a buy climax day on the 5 minute chart, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading today starting in the 1st couple hours. It is probably too late in the month for the bears to erase the bullishness on the monthly chart this month, with only 2 days remaining.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 9 points in the Globex session. If it opens here, it will be at the bottom of the 2-hour trading range at the end of yesterday. Remember, the odds favor at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading, to begin by the end of the 2nd hour. It often begins on the open.<p>The odds are against a strong bull day after 2 strong bull days. Many bulls will take some profits on strong rallies. But the odds are also against a big bear day when the momentum up has been so strong. Today will probably be either a weak bull or bear trend day. Also, it will probably spend a lot of time going sideways. There should be at least one swing up and one swing down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-25.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and small pullback bull trend.

This is a breakout above a head and shoulders bottom bull flag.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high, which would be far above the January 22 high. Then, they need tomorrow to have at least a small bull body. If they get both, traders will look for the rally to have at least a 2nd leg up, and test the January 6 high. But if today closes in the middle of the day’s range, or if tomorrow has a bear body, traders will expect this breakout to fail.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the 5-minute chart rallied strong overnight. Day traders have only been buying, and they bought for a swing trade and for scalps. The EURUSD has been going sideways for a couple hours. However, the range is only 15 pips tall. That is not big enough for day traders to begin to sell. They will only buy until there is at least a 20 pip pullback. Even then, it will still be easier to make money as a bull.<p>Can today reverse down? Yes, but the bears will usually have to get at least one 20-pip selloff first, and then some kind of a double top. It is more likely that today will be mostly sideways for the remainder of the day.<p>The fight will be over the close. The more the day closes near the high, the more likely the breakout will succeed. But if the bears can get the day to close in the middle of its range, and around the January 22 high, the bulls will need a strong bull day tomorrow to make traders conclude that the breakout will be successful.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-strong-bear-trend-and-then-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini strong bear trend and then parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The sell climax reversed up at a cluster of support below yesterday’s low and the January high, and just above the midpoint of February’s range. After the initial bounce, there was a higher low major trend reversal that retraced about half of the day’s range. The Emini then sold off again into the end of the day.<p>A gap down tomorrow would create a month-long island top with the February 2 gap up. If the gap stays open, it could lead to a measured move down to around 3,600.<p>A big bear day tomorrow would make tomorrow the 1st time since October when the daily chart had consecutive big bear bodies. That would make a 10% correction likely over the next few weeks. Also, there would be a break below the bull trend line on the weekly chart from the pandemic low in March last year.<p>Tomorrow is the last trading day of the week and month. If February closes below its midpoint tomorrow, there will be an increased chance of lower prices in March.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders are still deciding whether the Emini will close below month midpoint today, and in early stages of a 10% correction, or in a bull flag. One day looks good for the bulls, and then next is good for the bears.<p>But if today is a 2nd consecutive big bear day, it would be the 1st time this has happened since the 10% selloffs in September and in October. It would make it likely that the Emini will fall about 10% within a few weeks.<p>If today gaps down and the gap stays open, there would be a month-long island top with the February 2 gap up. Traders would look for a measured move down to around 3,600.<p>Today is the last day of the week and the last trading day of February, and therefore weekly and monthly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<p>On the weekly chart, the bears want the week to close below the open. There would then be a bear body, which would increase the chance of sideways to down trading next week.<p>The bulls want the month to close above the January high and above the midpoint of the month. That would increase the chance of sideways to up trading in March. But if February closes below the midpoint of the month, traders would expect sideways to down trading in March.<p>The last day of the week, and of the month, tends to have bigger and faster moves, especially at the end of the day. With the Emini finishing yesterday around the weekly and monthly magnets, it might trade sideways today until the end of the day, and then decide on a bullish or bearish close.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 11 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open around a cluster of magnets, which include the midpoint of February, the low of the week, the weekly and daily bull trend lines, the 50-day MA, and Wednesday’s low. That increases the chance of a trading range.<p>Also, yesterday was a sell climax. The day after a sell climax has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading starting by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>But even if today is a trading range day, the range yesterday was very big. The legs today should be big enough for at least one swing trade up or down.<p>Because of the importance of consecutive big bear days, if the Emini has begun a 10% correction, today could be a 2nd big bear day. But every big bear day since the end of October was followed by a bull day. Therefore, the bulls will bet that today will close above the open. However, even though the other bear days were followed by bull days, most of the bull days were small. That reduces the chance of a big bull day today.<p>Since today is the final day of the week and of the month, there is an increased chance of a big move in either direction at the end of the day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-strong-bear-trend-and-then-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-26.png\" alt=\"Emini strong bear trend and then parabolic wedge sell climax.

id=\"0-market-overview-weekend-market-analysis\">Market Overview: Weekend Market Analysis</h2><p>The<strong>SP500 Emini</strong>futures finally had consecutive big bear days on the daily chart. It will probably correct 10% over the next few weeks.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>on the monthly chart collapsed down to support. There should be a short covering bounce in March.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has a wedge rally to a double top. But the rally was strong, and there might be one more new high before there is a correction.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures\">30-year Treasury Bond futures</h2><h3 id=\"2-bond-futures-monthly-and-weekly-charts-have-extreme-sell-climax-so-expect-bounce-in-march\">Bond futures<em>monthly</em>and<em>weekly</em>charts have extreme sell climax so expect bounce in March</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-sell-climax-at-support.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-27.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart in sell climax at support\"></a></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-sell-climax-at-support.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-27-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in sell climax at support\"></a></figure><p>Bond futures have been collapsing on the monthly chart. I have been saying that they would fall below the March 2020 low on the weekly chart, which was the bottom of the reversal down from the buy climax. I also said that bonds should fall below the August 2019 high, which was the breakout point of the 2020 buy climax. Finally, I said bonds should test the February 2020 low on the weekly chart. That was the bottom of the final leg up in last year’s extreme buy climax on the weekly chart. Bonds reached all 3 targets this month.<p>A reversal from a buy climax typically tests the start of the final leg up. Therefore, the selloff should also reach the January 2020 low, which was the start of the buy climax on the monthly chart. However, with the current sell climax as extreme as it is, and at support, bonds might bounce first.<p>This month was the biggest bar on the monthly chart in a yearlong sell climax. It is now testing important support. Many bears will see this as an opportunity to take extremely big profits. Also, the bulls will begin to buy, betting on a short covering bounce up from support.<p>Can a March rally reach all of the way back up to the February high? While it probably will not, it might because the selloff has been extreme. Just like a reversal down from a buy climax tends to reach the start of the buy climax, a reversal up from a sell climax often gets drawn up to the start of the sell climax. On the monthly chart, that is either the February or January high.<p>But if bonds are going to rally, they will probably not go straight up. They might have to go sideways for a few bars (months) before going up. Also, they may reach the January 2020 low before there is a rally to the February high.<p>At the moment, they are so oversold that short covering should result in a pause and likely bounce over the next month or two. Ultimately, they will fall to the January 2020 low before rallying strongly. Also, as I have been saying for a year, they will be lower in 5 years and in 10 years.<h2 id=\"3-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-both-weak-buy-and-sell-signals-which-means-more-sideways-is-likely\">The EURUSD<em>monthly</em>chart has both weak buy and sell signals, which means more sideways is likely</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-rally-to-a-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-27-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has wedge rally to a double top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD monthly chart has rallied strongly for the past year and is at the top of a 6-year trading range. A wedge rally to a double top is a reliable sell setup.<p>Traders expect higher prices, but are uncertain if the reversal down from the January wedge top has more to go. If so, a reasonable target is the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the November low of 1.16.<p>The bulls are hoping that the 2nd leg up in the wedge, to the September high, was strong enough to start the count over again. Instead of March 2020 being the 1st leg up, the bulls want September to be the 1st leg. If it is, the wedge might have one more leg up to around the February 2018 high of 1.2555 before there is a correction.<h4 id=\"5-which-is-more-likely-116-or-125\">Which is more likely, 1.16 or 1.25?</h4><p>Is the EURUSD correcting down from a wedge top to 1.16, or is it forming a bull flag for a move up to 1.2555?<p>January was the sell signal bar, but it had a big tail below. That means it is a lower probability sell signal. February triggered the sell signal by going below the January low, but it closed above the January low. That means there were more buyers than sellers below the sell signal bar. Because it only had a small bear body, it is a weak entry bar, after a weak sell signal bar.<p>The bulls see February as a pullback in the yearlong rally. It is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. But it was not a big bull bar closing on its high. A bear bar is a weak buy signal bar. Also, it is forcing the bulls to buy at the top of a 3-bar tight trading range, and just below the top of a 6-year trading range. Therefore, there might be more sellers than buyers above its high.<p>With buyers below and sellers above, and with unconvincing buy and sell signals, the EURUSD might have to go sideways at least a little longer. If the bulls get a breakout above the December high, there probably will be sellers above that high. This is because the EURUSD is at the top of a trading range. A reversal down would be from a wedge, and it would probably reach the November low.<p>If the bears get a breakout, there will probably be buyers around the November low. This is because last year’s rally was very strong, and it came from a higher low compared to the 2017 bear trend low.<p>With sellers above 1.25 and buyers below around 1.16, the EURUSD will probably be rangebound for 2021. However, the wedge rally to a double top is a fairly reliable topping pattern. It is slightly more likely that the EURUSD will work down to the November low before breaking above the December high.<h2 id=\"6-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"7-the-monthly-emini-chart-has-minor-parabolic-wedge-top\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart has minor parabolic wedge top</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-27-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart traded above the January high, but finished the month in the middle of its range. That is neutral, like January’s small body, and it lowers the probability of a big move up or down in March.<p>The monthly chart has had 3 thrusts up from the pandemic low. If there is a reversal down within the next couple of months, traders would see the yearlong rally as a parabolic wedge top. On the monthly chart, the wedge only has 6 bars. If March reverses down, the top will be minor. Therefore, once there is a reversal down, it should only last for a couple bars (months), like most reversals since 2016 (in 2018, one reversal lasted for 3 months).<h4 id=\"8-where-is-support\">Where is support?</h4><p>When a bull channel is tight like this, traders typically are eager to buy the 1st selloff. There will be bulls looking to buy a 10% and a 20% selloff. Traders pay attention to these numbers. When a market sells off 10%, the selloff is a correction, and not a pullback. Once it falls 20%, it is a bear market. The bulls buy these key levels as support, betting that once the name of the selloff changes, there will be other buyers betting on a resumption of the bull trend.<p>A 10% correction would be at the November 10 low at 3,500. This is important on the weekly and daily charts (see below).<p>A 20% correction is around the October low at 3200. There was a 2-month trading range there and that is a possible Final Bull Flag on the weekly chart. A Final Flag is often a magnet.<p>Others will look to buy based on key prices on the monthly chart. The 2-month trading range on the weekly chart is within a 4-bar tight trading range on the monthly chart. A tight trading range is an area of agreement. If the Emini trades down, traders might wait for it to get back to that neutral area before they look to buy again. That range was between 3,200 and 3,600.<p>Another chart target is the September high around 3,550. That was the breakout point for the 3rd leg up. After the 2nd leg up broke above the February 2020 high, it pulled back below that high 2 months later. Trends tend to weaken as they get older. Therefore, the Emini should pull back below the most recent breakout point (the September high) within a couple months.<p>Can it get down to 3,200 at the bottom of the October trading range? That is about a 20% correction, and it might be too far for a first leg down. The bull channel has been tight, and that means traders are eagerly buying small pullbacks. There might too many eager bulls buying at around 10% down for the 1st leg down to fall 20%.<h4 id=\"9-can-the-emini-continue-to-above-4000-without-pulling-back\">Can the Emini continue to above 4,000 without pulling back?</h4><p>What about the bull case? There has only been a single pullback to below a prior month’s low in a year, and that pullback was only a single bar. The bulls have been very aggressive.<p>Can the rally continue up to above 4,000 without March going below the February low? If a trader just looks at the monthly chart, February was neutral. Therefore, one could conclude that there is a 50% chance that March will go above the February high and test 4,000, and a 50% chance it will fall below the February low.<p>But with January and February having small bodies and largely overlapping one another, there is a reduced chance of a big move up or down from here within the next few months. That means it probably will not go more than a bar or two either way before it reverses again.<h4 id=\"10-reversing-down-from-above-a-bull-channel\">Reversing down from above a bull channel</h4><p>There is one important factor that makes a pullback likely. I have written every week for 6 months that the monthly chart has been at the top of a bull channel. I have said that a breakout above a bull channel fails 75% of the time within about 5 bars. February is the 3rd bar, and there is a micro double top with the January high. While the Emini might go a little more sideways to up, traders should expect it to reverse down for at least a couple months. It looks like it will reverse down in March.<p>When there is a reversal down from above the top of a channel, many bears look for it to fall to the bottom or about the middle of the channel. The chance of reaching the bottom is small in 2021. However, the middle is around 3,200, which is at the October low, and it is a 20% correction. At the moment, there is a 60% chance of a selloff in the next few months to below the September high of 3,568.50 and a 30% chance of a selloff to 3,200 before there is a new high.<h3 id=\"11-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-is-reversing-down-from-above-2-bull-channels\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is reversing down from above 2 bull channels</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-27-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has failed breakout above bull channels\"></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a 2nd consecutive bear bar this week. This is the 1st time this has happened since early November. But neither bar was particularly big, and therefore traders have not yet decided to sell aggressively.<p>The Emini also reversed down from above the bull channel. There are two ways to draw the channel. I have been saying that the break above the bull channel that began 2 weeks ago, would likely reverse down within 5 bars (weeks). That is what typically happens when there is a breakout above a bull channel. This week is the reversal.<p>The 1st target is the bottom of the channel. But since the wedge up from May 2019 is now very tight, the bull trend line at the bottom of the channel is only a little below the top of the channel. This week already reached that initial downside target.<p>The Emini is now back in January’s 5-week trading range. A tight trading range late in a bull trend, is often the Final Bull Flag. Back in January, I said that the trading range was likely going to be the final flag.<p>The reversal down into the trading range does not mean that a bear trend has begun. When there is a final flag reversal, the market usually tests the bottom of the flag, which is around 3,650. At that point, traders decide whether the Emini will resume up, or fall to the next support. The next support is at the start of the bull channel that began on November 10, and that low is around 3,500.<h4 id=\"12-still-in-a-small-pullback-bull-trend\">Still in a Small Pullback Bull Trend</h4><p>The yearlong bull trend has been a Small Pullback Bull Trend. All of the pullbacks have been small. The bulls hope that this one only lasts a couple weeks, and that the rally continues up above 4,000. But since there is a parabolic wedge buy climax, and consecutive bear bars reversing down from the top of the channel, there is a 60% chance that the Emini has begun a bigger pullback, like in September and October.<p>Because the reversal is coming from a parabolic wedge buy climax, it could last about 10 bars (weeks) and have a couple legs sideways to down. But that is not a bear trend. The best the bears will probably get is a trading range. If there is a trading range, and it lasts 10 or more bars, then the bears would have a 40% chance of a trend reversal down. Until then, the chance of a bear trend on the weekly chart is only 30%. Traders are planning to buy the 1st reversal down, expecting at least one more new high.<h3 id=\"13-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-finally-has-strong-consecutive-big-bear-bars-so-10-correction-likely\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart finally has strong consecutive big bear bars so 10% correction likely</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-consecutive-strong-bear-bars-so-10-correction-likely.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-2-27-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily chart has strong consecutive big bear bars so 10% correction likely\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a strong bull trend for a year. The bulls bought every selloff. From late October to mid-February, no pullback fell more that 3 days. Traders bought each one and their buying soon led to a new high. But some things have changed, and there is now a 60% chance that the Emini will fall further before the bulls come back<p>It is important to note that the Emini has been sideways for the past month, and it has been working lower since February 16. This is the 1st pullback since October that has fallen more than 3 bars (days).<p>Will the bulls buy the pullback next week? Every time there has been a big bear bar since late October, the bulls bought it and the bull trend resumed. However, this is the 1st time since the 10% corrections in September and October, when the day after a big bear day also had a bear body. That makes it likely that the Spike and Channel Bull Trend that began in November, is finally transitioning into a trading range. The current selloff should only be a bear leg in what will be a trading range, but the bottom of the bear leg will probably be about 10% down. It could retrace the entire rally, which began On October 30 at around 3,200.<h4 id=\"14-what-magnets-are-pulling-the-emini-down\">What magnets are pulling the Emini down?</h4><p>Look at the strong reversal down on November 9. That high was just below 3,650. There were 2 more tests of that high over the next 2 weeks, and the Emini turned down both times. Then the Emini broke above it. There were several tests back down to it in December and January. The chart is telling traders that it is an important price. It is therefore a logical magnet for the current selloff.<p>If the Emini gets there, the next magnet is just a little lower. The rally to November 9 was a breakout, which I call a spike up. The rally from November 10 was a bull channel. Once there is a reversal in a Spike and Channel Bull Trend, and the Emini appears to be reversing, it often goes all of the way down to the start of the bull channel. That is the November 10 low at 3,500. If the Emini gets there, there would be a 10% correction.<h3 id=\"15-summary-of-what-to-expect-in-march\">Summary of what to expect in March</h3><p>There is a 40% chance that the Emini will soon make a new high. The odds will favor a new high if the bulls get a couple consecutive strong bull days. Now, there is a 60% chance that the Emini will test the January 29 low and maybe the November 9 high, between 3,650 and 3,700. There is a 50% chance of the selloff reaching the November 9 low at 3,500, and a 30% chance of a 20% correction down to the October 30 low at 3,200.<h2 id=\"16-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
