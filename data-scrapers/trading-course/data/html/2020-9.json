The bulls had a gap up in August and August closed near the high of the month yesterday. The bulls want another gap up today for a 2nd consecutive gap up on the monthly chart. But, today so far is trading 5 points below the August high in the Globex session with 45 minutes to go before the open. That makes a monthly gap up unlikely.<p>Because of the 2 streaks of 9 and now 7 consecutive bull days on daily chart, the Emini will probably reverse down about 10% starting this month. It could begin after a brief break above the August high. Consequently, traders should be looking for a possible swing down beginning soon.<p>Since there is a bullish tendency in the week before Labor Day, the selloff might begin next week. However, this is a very overbought market and profit taking can come quickly and at any time. Until it does, traders will continue to buy every intraday selloff, betting on higher prices.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex session. The bulls want to get back to the Globex high by the end of the session because that high is above the August high. September would then gap up on the monthly chart. However, the bars over the past several hours have been small. There might not be enough energy to get the monthly gap up.<p>If there is a monthly gap up, it will probably be small. Small gaps up typically close before the bar ends. That means before the end of September.<p>After 5 strong bull bars on the monthly chart. September will probably trade above the August high. It might do that today. However, because of the buy climax on the daily chart, the Emini will probably not go far above the August high before reversing down for a few weeks.<p>Yesterday was the 1st bear day in 8 days on the daily chart. It is therefore a sell signal bar for today. But because it had a big tail below, there will probably be buyers below. This is especially true after 7 consecutive bull days. However, if the Emini goes sideways here for a few days, the bears might be able to form a micro double top. They would then have a better chance of a reversal down.<p>The past 3 days were mostly sideways. Day traders will expect more trading range price action today. The legs up and down were big enough for swing trading. Day traders will therefore look for at least one swing up and one swing down today as well.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-nested-expanding-triangles-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-1.png\" alt=\"Emini nested expanding triangles at all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There was therefore a wedge top. Today is breaking above the wedge top. Now that September went above the wedge top, there is a 50% chance of a successful breakout and a couple legs up to a measured move. The odds will go up if there are consecutive closes above the August 18 top of the wedge.<p>There is also a 50% chance that the breakout will fail and the EURUSD will reverse down. The bears will need a bear reversal bar within the next week. It is important for the bears to prevent 2 consecutive closes above the August 18 high if they expect the breakout to fail.<p>On the monthly chart, July was a big bull bar that broke above the 18 month bear channel and the September 2018 high. August was the follow-through bar. Since it had a bull body, September was likely to go at least a little above August high. It has done that on the 1st day of the month.<p>The weekly chart has a parabolic wedge rally. That typically soon attracts profit takers. Also, there was a streak of 8 consecutive bull bars that ended 2 weeks ago. That, too, is a buy climax and usually leads to profit taking. Consequently, the odds still favor a pullback beginning in September and lasting several weeks. But there is no sign of a top yet.<p>With today’s high so far being just below the 1.20 Big Round Number, the odds are that the EURUSD will hit that price this week and then decide whether to break strongly above it or reverse down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied early overnight to above the August high. However, it has been in a 40 pips trading range since. While a trading range in a bull trend is still a bull flag, day traders have been buying low, selling high, and scalping for over 6 hours. There is no sign that this is about to end.<p>Because today is a breakout on the monthly chart, there is an increased chance of a big trend up or down. However, the 6 hour trading range make it more likely that today will remain in a trading range in the US session.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bull-channel-and-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel and bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That was also the August high and a target for September.<p>Although it spent a lot of time within tight trading ranges, there was also a bull channel up from a cup and handle buy setup. With it closing near the high, there is an increased chance of a gap up tomorrow. The strong bull trend on the daily chart might accelerate into a blow-off top.<p>As strong as the Small Pullback Bull Trend has been for 3 months, the streaks of 9 and 7 consecutive bull bars is a problem. They make a 10% pullback likely to begin at some point in September.<p>There is no top yet so traders continue to buy. However, they will be quick to sell if there is a reversal. This is because the stop for the bulls is far below and no one wants the stop to be hit. They do not want to give back that much profit. Instead, the bulls will rush to exit once this starts to turn down. That can create a surprisingly fast selloff en route to a 10% pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The rally was in a weak bull channel, but the day closed near the high. That increases the chance of a gap up today.<p>The daily chart is late in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That type of trend sometimes accelerates upward into a blow-off top. This rally has that potential.<p>After the streaks of 9 and then 7 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart, traders should expect a 10% correction to begin in September. How much higher can the Emini go? Buy climaxes can go extremely far before the bulls begin to take profits. Until there is a strong reversal down, traders will continue to buy every selloff on the 5 minute chart, and they will buy the 1st pullback on the daily chart.<p>There is now a 9 bar bull micro channel on the daily chart. The bulls typically buy the 1st pullback. Therefore, there is not much downside risk over the next couple days. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they will be able to get a reversal down that will last more than 2 – 3 days.<p>Since the past 4 days have had a lot of trading range price action, traders will expect that to continue today. There have been legs up and down that were big enough for swing traders. Traders will expect that again today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. There will probably be a big gap up. About 20% of the time, there will be either a bull or bear trend from the open. This typically begins with a series of trend bars.<p>It is important to understand that a trading range open is more common. Traders do not like to pay far above the average price. This usually limits the size of a rally when there is a big gap up. The market typically enters a trading range until it gets near the EMA, which is rising sharply.<p>The trading range usually will have either a double top or a wedge top. The bears will short it, expecting a selloff down to at least to the EMA. Once the emini gets near the EMA, the bulls will look to buy either a double bottom or wedge bottom.<p>If there is a trading range open and then a trend up or down, the trend usually does not last all day. Traders will look for either a midday trading range of a reversal.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ES-Emini-5-minute-Chart-Bull-Channel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-2.jpg\" alt=\"ES Emini 5-minute Chart Bull Channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That was the start of the 18 month bear channel.<p>What typically happens after a break above a bear channel is that the rally tests the start of the channel and then there is a selloff. At that point, the bear channel will have evolved into a trading range. This is still the most likely outcome here, despite the unusually strong summer rally.<p>Most wedge tops have 3 reversals. This one now has 4. August was a trading range that was tilted up a little.<p>The EURUSD has been in a bull channel for 5 weeks as well as a trading range. A bull channel is also a wedge top. If the bulls get consecutive closes above the range, they will expect a rally up to the February 2018 high of 1.25.<p>It is still slightly more likely that there will be a bear breakout of the trading range and then a test of the breakout points. These are the March 9 and June 10 highs.<p>Trading ranges can last a long time. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will look for reversals every few days. Also, the probability of a successful bear breakout is about the same as for a bull breakout. A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern, even in a bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>Yesterday was a sell signal bar for a wedge top on the daily chart. The EURUSD triggered the sell signal overnight by breaking below yesterday’s low.<p>The 5 minute chart formed a trading range around yesterday’s low and then broke to the downside. It then quickly entered a 2nd trading range.<p>This is a Trending Trading Range pattern and is a weak bear trend. It has been sideways for 6 hours in a 35 pip range.<p>Since it is in a trading range, day traders are trading reversals for 10 pip scalps. The bulls want a reversal back up to above yesterday’s low. They hope that today will be a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The bears are happy with the EURUSD staying in the lower range. Today would then be a bear entry bar on the daily chart, which would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices tomorrow.<p>While they would like another leg down today, that is not necessary. This week is already a good sell signal bar on the weekly chart. All the bears need to do is prevent a reversal up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend-and-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bull Trend and buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The rally was in a weak bull channel, but the day closed near the high. That increases the chance of a gap up today.<p>The daily chart is late in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That type of trend sometimes accelerates upward into a blow-off top. This rally has that potential.<p>After the streaks of 9 and then 7 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart, traders should expect a 10% correction to begin in September. How much higher can the Emini go? Buy climaxes can go extremely far before the bulls begin to take profits. Until there is a strong reversal down, traders will continue to buy every selloff on the 5 minute chart, and they will buy the 1st pullback on the daily chart.<p>There is now a 9 bar bull micro channel on the daily chart. The bulls typically buy the 1st pullback. Therefore, there is not much downside risk over the next couple days. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they will be able to get a reversal down that will last more than 2 – 3 days.<p>Since the past 4 days have had a lot of trading range price action, traders will expect that to continue today. There have been legs up and down that were big enough for swing traders. Traders will expect that again today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. There will probably be a big gap up. About 20% of the time, there will be either a bull or bear trend from the open. This typically begins with a series of trend bars.<p>It is important to understand that a trading range open is more common. Traders do not like to pay far above the average price. This usually limits the size of a rally when there is a big gap up. The market typically enters a trading range until it gets near the EMA, which is rising sharply.<p>The trading range usually will have either a double top or a wedge top. The bears will short it, expecting a selloff down to at least to the EMA. Once the emini gets near the EMA, the bulls will look to buy either a double bottom or wedge bottom.<p>If there is a trading range open and then a trend up or down, the trend usually does not last all day. Traders will look for either a midday trading range of a reversal.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ES-Emini-5-minute-Chart-Bull-Channel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-2.jpg\" alt=\"ES Emini 5-minute Chart Bull Channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That was the start of the 18 month bear channel.<p>What typically happens after a break above a bear channel is that the rally tests the start of the channel and then there is a selloff. At that point, the bear channel will have evolved into a trading range. This is still the most likely outcome here, despite the unusually strong summer rally.<p>Most wedge tops have 3 reversals. This one now has 4. August was a trading range that was tilted up a little.<p>The EURUSD has been in a bull channel for 5 weeks as well as a trading range. A bull channel is also a wedge top. If the bulls get consecutive closes above the range, they will expect a rally up to the February 2018 high of 1.25.<p>It is still slightly more likely that there will be a bear breakout of the trading range and then a test of the breakout points. These are the March 9 and June 10 highs.<p>Trading ranges can last a long time. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will look for reversals every few days. Also, the probability of a successful bear breakout is about the same as for a bull breakout. A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern, even in a bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>Yesterday was a sell signal bar for a wedge top on the daily chart. The EURUSD triggered the sell signal overnight by breaking below yesterday’s low.<p>The 5 minute chart formed a trading range around yesterday’s low and then broke to the downside. It then quickly entered a 2nd trading range.<p>This is a Trending Trading Range pattern and is a weak bear trend. It has been sideways for 6 hours in a 35 pip range.<p>Since it is in a trading range, day traders are trading reversals for 10 pip scalps. The bulls want a reversal back up to above yesterday’s low. They hope that today will be a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The bears are happy with the EURUSD staying in the lower range. Today would then be a bear entry bar on the daily chart, which would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices tomorrow.<p>While they would like another leg down today, that is not necessary. This week is already a good sell signal bar on the weekly chart. All the bears need to do is prevent a reversal up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend-and-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bull Trend and buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is a 10 bar bull micro channel, which is a sign of very aggressive bulls.<p>But it is also unusual and therefore a buy climax. The streaks of 7 and 9 consecutive bull days is also climactic. Buy climaxes usually lead to profit taking, but there is no sign of it yet. Traders should expect a 10% pullback to begin at some point in September.<p>Traders know that buy climaxes can go a very long way before there is profit taking. The odds therefore favor higher prices.<p>After a 10 bar bull micro channel, traders usually buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback. While a big reversal down is likely at some point, it will probably not begin this week.<p>There is also a 10 bar bull micro channel on the weekly chart. Therefore, traders will probably buy the 1st 1 – 2 week pullback as well.<p>The next target is 3704.50. That is the measured move projection from the March low to the April 29 high. There is a gap above that high created by the 2 selloffs in June.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 19 points in the Globex session. Since yesterday was a strong buy climax day, traders expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading to begin by the end of the 2nd hour today. There is only a 25% chance of either a strong bull or bear trend today.

Because there are higher highs and lows, the trading range is also a bull channel, which is a bull trend. But there are also 4 reversals down. When a channel has 3 or more reversals, it is a wedge, which can lead to a reversal.<p>Since the EURUSD has had 4 reversals down at major resistance, the odds slightly favor a bear breakout. But it is important to understand that the EURUSD would not be in the middle of the trading range if either side had a high probability of winning. It is currently slightly better for the bears, but until there is a breakout, there is no breakout, and traders are continuing to take quick profits every few days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market dipped below the September 2018 high and below yesterday’s low but then bounced. It has been sideways for 5 hours, oscillating around these key prices. Day traders have been scalping up and down.<p>While yesterday was a bear day and the entry bar on the daily chart for the wedge top, yesterday had a tail on its low. It bounced at the September 2018 high. Traders are still hesitating. They are deciding whether the EURUSD will breakout above or below the August range.<p>There is no sustained movement up or down. Day traders are looking for reversals and small trades. This will continue until there is a series of big bull or bear bars on the 5 minute chart.

It ended with a reversal up from a 4 hour wedge bottom. Therefore, tomorrow should continue up to the start of the wedge. That is the 9 am PST high, which is just below the open of the week and the 3500 Big Round Number.<p>If tomorrow closes below the open of the week, this week will be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. That will make at least slightly lower prices likely next week.<p>The bears want a 2nd consecutive big bear day tomorrow. They hope that the 10 – 20% correction began today.<p>And it might have. It is more likely that the bulls will try to get the Emini back above the open of the week tomorrow, at least briefly. That could be a magnet all day.<p>The bulls want a strong reversal up. They hope that today was just a bear trap and that the bull trend is still intact.<p>Traders will find out over the next week. Will any reversal up fail after a few days?<p>At the moment, the odds are that today is the start of a move down to 3200 and maybe 3000. A big bull day tomorrow or 2 or 3 small bull days would shift the odds back in favor of the bulls.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It ended with a reversal up from a 4 hour wedge bottom. Therefore, tomorrow should continue up to the start of the wedge. That is the 9 am PST high, which is just below the open of the week and the 3500 Big Round Number.<p>If tomorrow closes below the open of the week, this week will be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. That will make at least slightly lower prices likely next week.<p>The bears want a 2nd consecutive big bear day tomorrow. They hope that the 10 – 20% correction began today.<p>And it might have. It is more likely that the bulls will try to get the Emini back above the open of the week tomorrow, at least briefly. That could be a magnet all day.<p>The bulls want a strong reversal up. They hope that today was just a bear trap and that the bull trend is still intact.<p>Traders will find out over the next week. Will any reversal up fail after a few days?<p>At the moment, the odds are that today is the start of a move down to 3200 and maybe 3000. A big bull day tomorrow or 2 or 3 small bull days would shift the odds back in favor of the bulls.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It began a reversal up from a 5 hour wedge bottom on the 5 minute chart in the final hour. That increases the chance of a continuation up early today. The open of the week is an obvious magnet.<p>If today closes below the open of the week, this week will be a bear reversal bar on the weekly chart. That would be a sell signal bar for a buy climax top. Traders would expect at least slightly lower prices next week.<p>As you know, I have been saying that the 2 streaks of 9 and 7 consecutive bull bars make a 10 – 20% selloff likely to begin in September. It might have started yesterday. But the bears need follow-through selling today and over the next few days.<p>If today instead closes on its high, it will undo yesterday’s bearishness. Traders will then wonder if there will be one more new high before the selloff begins.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 5 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a sell climax day on the 5 minute chart. The day after a sell climax has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that begins by at least the 2nd hour.<p>The Emini reversed up from a wedge bottom at the end of the day yesterday. Traders expect a 2nd leg up to at least the start of the wedge, which was the 9 am PST lower high.<p>That is near the 3500 Big Round Number and the open of the week. Both are magnets above. Remember the bulls do not want a bear body on the weekly chart. They will try to get the week to close above Monday’s open. The closer the week closes to the low, the stronger the sell signal bar on the weekly chart will be.<p>The most likely outcome for today is a test of the open of the week and a trading range. There will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>Traders will then wait until next week to decide if yesterday was just a brief bear trap in a bull trend or the start of a 10 – 20% swing down. The bear case is currently more likely. But 1 or 2 big bull days will show that the bulls are still in control.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-Spike-and-Channel-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-4.png\" alt=\"Emini Spike and Channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There are higher lows and highs and the trading range is also a weak bull channel.<p>Yesterday was another higher low. The bulls want 2 closes above the top of the range to confirm a bull breakout. They then want a measured move up to the February 2018 high at around 1.25.<p>After reversing down from the wedge 2 days ago, the bears expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. They therefore think that there will be sellers above yesterday’s high. However, they want the lower high to lead to a strong 2nd leg down. They want it to break below the August trading range and then test the breakout point of the June 10 high. The daily chart is currently still on the wedge top sell signal from 2 days ago.<p>The bear case is slightly more likely, but until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will continue to look for reversals every few days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market went above yesterday’s high to trigger a higher low buy signal on the daily chart. But, the breakout was only 1 pip and it then sold off 40 pips over the past 4 hours. This is because traders expected a lower high and a 2nd leg down on the daily chart.<p>Most of the overnight trading has been sideways. This is what typically happens in the middle of a trading range. Day traders expect reversals and scalp for 10 – 20 pips up or down. If the chart begins to have a series of strong trend bars in either direction, they will switch to swing trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The selloff dipped below the bottom of the streak of 7 consecutive bull days and reversed up, which I have been saying was the 1st target for the bears.<p>Because Friday reversed up, it is a buy signal bar for today. But with its big bear body, it is a weak buy signal. There will probably be sellers above its high, especially around 3500. Traders expect a 2nd leg down, maybe to the bottom of the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars, which is around 3200. Less likely, to the start of the 2 month tight bull channel, which was around 3,000<p>Did the selloff end on Friday? That is unlikely. But if the bulls get 2 or 3 big bull bars this week, traders will begin to wonder if the bull trend is resuming.<p>Last week traded above the high of the prior week and then below its low. It was therefore an outside down week in a buy climax on the weekly chart. Since it closed in the middle third of the bar, it is a weak sell signal bar for this week. However, traders should expect lower prices and the bears will try to trigger the sell signal by getting this week to trade below last week’s low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini futures is down 44 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open with a big gap down.<p>When there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the average price. One measure is the 20 bar EMA. Unless there are strong bear bars on the open, many bears will not sell on the open. They are only willing to sell far below the average price if the bars are very bearish.<p>Most of the time, a big gap down leads to a trading range open. The bears look for a wedge rally or a double top in the 1st hour or two to around the EMA and they then sell, hoping for the high of the day. The bulls look for a wedge bottom or a double bottom to buy for a swing up. There are often several minor legs before there is a good enough setup for a swing up or down.<p>There is sometimes a strong trend up or down that begins within the first few bars after a big gap down. Traders typically want to see consecutive strong bear trend bars before they are willing to sell, but they will often buy above a single big bear bar.<p>The bears want a close far below last week’s low. They want traders to conclude that the Emini will work lower for several weeks.<p>The bulls will buy around last week’s low. The want a double bottom with Thursday’s selloff. If they get a strong reversal up, traders will suspect that the selloff had ended.<p>At the moment, the bear case on the daily and weekly charts is more likely. Traders will continue to sell rallies until the bulls create s very strong reversal up. Friday’s rally was not enough.<h2>Last Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-8.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from last Friday.

As long as it is in the trading range, it is still in Breakout Mode. That means that the probability of a successful breakout up or down is about the same.<p>It has sold off for 6 days so the odds currently slightly favor a bear breakout. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders are ready for a bounce up from the bottom of the range if the bears fail to get a couple closes below the August low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market formed a bear trending trading range day overnight. There was a trading range, a bear breakout, and then another trading range. After dipping a few pips below last week’s low, the EURUSD reversed up from a double bottom. However, it is still in the lower trading range.<p>The bears want today to close far below last week’s low. Last week’s candlestick was a bear reversal bar and therefore a sell signal bar for a 4 month wedge top.<p>Today barely triggered the weekly sell signal, but then bounced back above the low of the sell signal bar. Remember, the EURUSD has been sideways for 7 weeks. Traders expect reversals down from the top and up from the bottom.<p>But just like the overnight bear breakout was small, so was the bounce. Traders are still deciding if this breakout below last week’s low will continue down to below the bottom of the 7 week trading range. Since most legs up and down in trading ranges lead to reversals and not breakouts, it is more likely that the EURUSD will bounce today or tomorrow than continue much further down.<p>Because the 5 minute chart has been in trading ranges overnight, day traders have been scalping for 10 pips up or down. They know that a breakout and a trend can begin at any time. But while they wait, they will scalp.<p>At a minimum, the bears want today to close below last week’s low and at the low of the session. That would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow.<p>However, the bulls want today to close above the midpoint of the day and especially above the open of the session. They would then expect higher prices tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-trading-open-and-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-8-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading open and late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The selloff dipped below the bottom of the streak of 7 consecutive bull days and reversed up, which I have been saying was the 1st target for the bears.<p>Because Friday reversed up, it is a buy signal bar for today. But with its big bear body, it is a weak buy signal. There will probably be sellers above its high, especially around 3500. Traders expect a 2nd leg down, maybe to the bottom of the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars, which is around 3200. Less likely, to the start of the 2 month tight bull channel, which was around 3,000<p>Did the selloff end on Friday? That is unlikely. But if the bulls get 2 or 3 big bull bars this week, traders will begin to wonder if the bull trend is resuming.<p>Last week traded above the high of the prior week and then below its low. It was therefore an outside down week in a buy climax on the weekly chart. Since it closed in the middle third of the bar, it is a weak sell signal bar for this week. However, traders should expect lower prices and the bears will try to trigger the sell signal by getting this week to trade below last week’s low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini futures is down 44 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open with a big gap down.<p>When there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the average price. One measure is the 20 bar EMA. Unless there are strong bear bars on the open, many bears will not sell on the open. They are only willing to sell far below the average price if the bars are very bearish.<p>Most of the time, a big gap down leads to a trading range open. The bears look for a wedge rally or a double top in the 1st hour or two to around the EMA and they then sell, hoping for the high of the day. The bulls look for a wedge bottom or a double bottom to buy for a swing up. There are often several minor legs before there is a good enough setup for a swing up or down.<p>There is sometimes a strong trend up or down that begins within the first few bars after a big gap down. Traders typically want to see consecutive strong bear trend bars before they are willing to sell, but they will often buy above a single big bear bar.<p>The bears want a close far below last week’s low. They want traders to conclude that the Emini will work lower for several weeks.<p>The bulls will buy around last week’s low. The want a double bottom with Thursday’s selloff. If they get a strong reversal up, traders will suspect that the selloff had ended.<p>At the moment, the bear case on the daily and weekly charts is more likely. Traders will continue to sell rallies until the bulls create s very strong reversal up. Friday’s rally was not enough.<h2>Last Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-8.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from last Friday.

It is oversold on the daily and 60 minute charts and probably will bounce today or tomorrow. However, traders expect a 2nd leg down to around the bottom of the 9 consecutive bull bars, which is around 3200. The selloff might reach 3000.<p>It is important to note that the 5 month reversal up from the March sell climax was strong. Traders will even buy a 10 – 20% selloff.

More likely, the Emini will be sideways to down for several weeks before the bulls will buy.

For the bears, it is turning down from a wedge top. Since there is a bigger wedge top on the weekly chart and it is at the resistance of the September 2018 lower high, traders should expect lower prices. A reasonable target is the June 10 high, which is the breakout point of the July rally.<p>However, a trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. The EURUSD cannot go sideways unless it is balanced. Therefore, the odds are only slightly better for the bears.<h3>1st new low in 2 months</h3><p>It is important to note that the EURUSD’s overnight low was 3 pips below the August 21 low. This is the 1st minor lower low since June, and it therefore is a sign that the bulls are not as strong as they have been. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout, and the odds are only slightly better for the bears.<p>The overnight breakout below the August 21 low has only been 3 pips. That is not convincing. Also, there are now 2 small legs down from the September 1 high. That is the minimum goal for the bears and some will take profits. If the bears do not break further below that low today, traders will expect a bounce to the top of the 3 day selloff, which was the start of the 2nd leg down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 35 pip tall trading range overnight. It barely broke below the August 21 low and its bounce up has been small. There is no energy. Day traders have been scalping reversals up and down for 10 pips.<p>The bears want today to close far below that low. That would increase the chance of a break below the 6 week trading range this week.<p>The bulls hope that today is the start of a reversal up from a double bottom with that low.<p>While it is possible that today could have a surprisingly strong move up or down, it is unlikely. At a minimum, the bulls want today to close above the open. Today would then be a stronger buy signal bar for tomorrow. This would increase the chance of a bounce for a few days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-with-late-profit-taking-selloff.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend with late profit taking selloff\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

For the bears, it is turning down from a wedge top. Since there is a bigger wedge top on the weekly chart and it is at the resistance of the September 2018 lower high, traders should expect lower prices. A reasonable target is the June 10 high, which is the breakout point of the July rally.<p>However, a trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. The EURUSD cannot go sideways unless it is balanced. Therefore, the odds are only slightly better for the bears.<h3>1st new low in 2 months</h3><p>It is important to note that the EURUSD’s overnight low was 3 pips below the August 21 low. This is the 1st minor lower low since June, and it therefore is a sign that the bulls are not as strong as they have been. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout, and the odds are only slightly better for the bears.<p>The overnight breakout below the August 21 low has only been 3 pips. That is not convincing. Also, there are now 2 small legs down from the September 1 high. That is the minimum goal for the bears and some will take profits. If the bears do not break further below that low today, traders will expect a bounce to the top of the 3 day selloff, which was the start of the 2nd leg down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 35 pip tall trading range overnight. It barely broke below the August 21 low and its bounce up has been small. There is no energy. Day traders have been scalping reversals up and down for 10 pips.<p>The bears want today to close far below that low. That would increase the chance of a break below the 6 week trading range this week.<p>The bulls hope that today is the start of a reversal up from a double bottom with that low.<p>While it is possible that today could have a surprisingly strong move up or down, it is unlikely. At a minimum, the bulls want today to close above the open. Today would then be a stronger buy signal bar for tomorrow. This would increase the chance of a bounce for a few days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-with-late-profit-taking-selloff.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend with late profit taking selloff\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Most traders will trade September today and switch to December tomorrow.<p>Yesterday reversed up strongly from Tuesday’s test of the July high. The bulls are hoping that the selloff has ended. Although there was a late selloff yesterday, they want a 2nd leg up today or tomorrow.<p>But even if they get it, traders expect a 2nd leg down to around 3000 -3200. They will look to sell a 2nd leg up to around 3450 – 3500.<p>What happens if today and tomorrow are huge bull days? The odds will shift back in favor of a new high rather than a selloff to 3200.<h3>Weekly chart had weak sell setup</h3><p>Over the weekend, I said that last week was an outside down bar on the weekly chart and it was at the resistance of the top of a 3 year channel. It was therefore a sell signal bar.<p>But I also said that it had a big tail below and that it closed above the low of the prior week. Finally, I wrote that there was an 8 bar bull micro channel. I concluded by saying that this was a weak sell setup and that there might be more buyers than sellers below last week’s low.<p>That does not mean that the bull trend will continue. Traders still expect a 2nd leg down on the daily chart. It simply means that the Emini might not fall sharply on the weekly chart. Instead, it might have to go sideways a little before it can go down. If this week is a bull bar on the weekly chart, it will increase the chance of more sideways trading next week before the Emini works down to at least 3200.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 7 points in the Globex session. It is currently in the middle of yesterday’s 4 hour trading range.<p>Traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to up after the 3 day sell climax. They are currently deciding if the 4 hour trading range is the end of the pullback from the 1st leg up or if the Emini has to retrace more of the rally up from Tuesday’s low. In either case, the 2nd leg up will probably reach 3450 – 3500 within a few days.<p>If today opens within yesterday’s trading range, traders will expect some continuation of that range. Today would then have a trading range open. The bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom for a swing up and the bears will look to sell a wedge rally or double top for a swing down.<p>About 20% of days have trends from the open, like yesterday. If there are 2 or 3 big trend bars on the open, especially if they break far above or below yesterday’s trading range, traders will expect a trend from the open. But because today is opening within yesterday’s range, day traders will look for early reversals.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-with-late-profit-taking-selloff.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-10.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend with late profit taking selloff\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It broke above the September 2018 high, and the reversal up is also from a test of that level.<p>However, it is still in a trading range, which means that it is in Breakout Mode. There is about a 50% chance of a successful breakout up or down. Traders are looking for reversals every few days and are unwilling to hold onto positions. They will continue to do that until there is a clear breakout.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market is reversing up from the bottom of a 6 week trading range. Yesterday was a buy signal bar. Today traded above yesterday’s high, which triggered the buy signal on the daily chart.<p>The EURUSD is currently at the high of the session on the 5 minute chart. The bulls want the day to close near its high and far above yesterday’s high. That would increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow.<p>The bears always want the opposite. They therefore would like today’s breakout to fail. That means they want today to close below yesterday’s high. Ideally, they want today to close on the low of the day. Today would then be a Low 1 sell signal bar on the daily chart for tomorrow.<h3>Bull trend on the 5 minute chart</h3><p>So far, the bulls have the advantage. The 5 minute chart has been consistently making higher highs and lows since today began. It is therefore in a bull trend.<p>It is now at the high of the session, but there was a big bull bar 15 minutes ago. That often will attract profit takers. If it does, it would probably result in a trading range for the next hour or two and possibly for the remainder of the day.<p>The bulls have already done all that they need to do on the daily chart. If today closes around where it is currently, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p>So far, day traders have only been buying, both for scalps and a swing up. If the 5 minute chart has a 20 – 30 pip pullback, day traders will conclude that the bull trend is evolving into a trading range. Day traders would then begin to sell reversals down for scalps, They will continue to buy, but will switch to buying pullbacks from buying at the market.<p>Can today reverse down? Yes, but the bears will probably have to first stop it from going up and create a trading range. The odds favor sideways to up for the rest of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-trading-range-open-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range open and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It sold off in a Spike and Channel Bear Trend to below yesterday’s low, last week’s low, the February high, and the open of the week.<p>Traders are deciding whether there will be a 2nd leg up after Wednesday’s rally, or if the Emini will just continue down to 3000 – 3200. Because the selloff on the 60 minute chart had many reversals, the bulls are willing to buy. That makes it likely that the Emini will try to get at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up before reaching the downside targets.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. The bears want a bear candlestick this week. They therefore want the week to close below the open of the week. Since last week was a sell signal bar, the bears want this week to close below last week’s low.<p>The bulls always want the opposite. They want this week to close above the week’s open, which would increase the chance of a bounce next week. However, the odds still favor a test of 3000 – 3200 before there is a new all-time high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bears are hoping that the bear trend is resuming.<p>However, the bulls would like at least one more leg up after the 3 day sell climax. They want this selloff to be brief and for the bull trend to resume.<p>But there were 9 and 7 day streaks of consecutive bull days last month. Bull streaks usually result in a selloff to below the bottom. Consequently, traders should expect this selloff to fall below 3200 before there is a new high.<p>Today is Friday and what happens today affects the appearance of this week’s candlestick on the weekly chart. The bears want this week to close below the open of the week so that it will have a bear body. Moreover, they want it to close below last week’s low. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>The bulls are hoping that the Emini closes above the open of the week. They would then have a better chance of a 2nd leg sideways to up next week. However, unless the bulls get 2 or 3 big bull days, traders expect the Emini to work down to 3000 – 3200 this month.<h3>50 day moving average is an important magnet just below</h3><p>The 50 day MA is just a little below yesterday’s low. Many traders want to wait for the Emini to touch it before looking for a 1 – 3 day bounce, or possibly for a resumption of the bull trend. Therefore, the Emini might have to go sideways to down for another day or two before it can test 3450 – 3500, if it is going to test that level.<p>It might already have begun a move down to 3000 – 3200. We should find out in the next few days. Traders want to see if it reverses up from the 50 day MA or breaks strongly below it. Traders might be waiting for Wednesday’s FOMC announcement.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 17 points in the Globex session. Since yesterday ended with a sell climax, there will probably be at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that begins by the 2nd hour today.<p>There is cluster of magnets around yesterday’s late trading range. That further increases the chance of trading range price action today.<p>The bulls want this week to close above last week’s low. Last week was an outside down week and therefore a sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<p>If this week closes above last week’s low, this week would be a weak entry bar. That would reduce the chance of a big selloff next week.<p>The bulls also want the week to close above the open of the week. This week would then have a bull body on the weekly chart. That would further reduce the chance of a strong selloff next week.<p>Finally, this week has been testing the February high, which is the breakout point for the August rally. The bulls want this week to close above that high. That would increase the chance that this week’s selloff was just a pullback to test that breakout point.<p>The bears always want the opposite. They want the week to close on its low, below last week’s low, and below the February high. It would then have a big bear body. This would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-trading-range-open-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-11.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range open and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-reversal-up-from-double-bottom-bull-flag-at-support.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-11-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex reversal up from double bottom bull flag at support\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart made a minor new low 2 days ago for the 1st time in 3 months and reversed up. That is noteworthy because it is a sign that the bears are stronger than they have been for a long time. The reversal up created a lower low double bottom bull flag at the EMA.<p>However, the 6 week tight trading range trumps everything. A trading range always has both a buy and a sell setup, but a trading range is a Breakout Mode condition.<p>A market can only be in a tight trading range if the bulls and bears are closely balanced. Traders know that reversals up and down are more likely than a successful breakout.<p>They also know that once there is a successful breakout, there is a 50% chance that it will be up or down. Until then, they will buy low, sell high, and take profits every few days<h3>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance are important</h3><p>It is important to remember that today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance are important. The weekly chart has been sideways in a tight range for 6 weeks. The week’s open was in the middle of that range.<p>The EURUSD is currently only a few pips from the open of the week. This week is so far a doji bar, which is neutral, and it is in the middle of a tight trading range, which is also neutral.<p>The EURUSD might trade around the open of the week for the remainder of the day today. And then, at the end of the day, close either a little above or below the open. That close will slightly change the probability of next week’s direction.<p>If there is a small bull body, traders will see this week as slightly bullish. That would make traders wonder if next week will trade above this week’s high. This week would be a weak High 1 buy signal bar for next week.<p>Alternatively, if this week has a bear body, traders would see it a minimally good entry bar for a reversal down from below last week low. It would slightly increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market so far today is forming an inside day. The low is above yesterday’s low and the high is below yesterday’s high.<p>Also, the EURUSD is in the middle of the 6 week tight trading range. In the past 5 hours, there was a 30 pip rally and almost a 30 pip reversal back down. Day traders are scalping, waiting for a strong breakout up or down.<p>It is trading around the open of the week, which will probably be a magnet all day. Consequently, if the EURUSD is 10 – 20 pips from it, day traders will look for a reversal back to it.<p>While it is always possible that any day can become a strong trend day, it is less likely when the market has no energy and it is in the middle of a 6 week tight trading range and near an important magnet.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-sell-climax-and-weak-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and weak bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This was a bear flag from yesterday’s bear trend.<p>It sold off briefly and continued in the TR for an hour. It then broke strongly to the downside. It poked below the 50 day MA and the 3000 Big Round Number and reversed up.<p>I have been saying that many bulls would not buy until after the Emini dipped below the 50 day MA. But now the bulls need a buy signal bar.<p>Although today had a big reversal up at midday, the bar on the daily chart had a bear body. Traders prefer to buy above bull bars, especially after a strong selloff. Many bulls will wait to see if Monday closes near its high and then buy. Traders wonder if the Emini might rally back to 3450 – 3500.<p>The bears hope that the Emini will break strongly below the 50 day MA to below the August low. It would then likely close the gap on the monthly chart. Also, September would be an outside down month. Traders would expect more sideways to down in October.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It should try to bounce early next week, but traders should still expect the selloff to eventually reach 3000 – 3200.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are in the middle of a 6 month trading range. Traders are looking for reversals every few days.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has stalled at the September 2018 high. There is a nested wedge top, which makes a pullback to the June 10 high likely. But, the 6-week tight trading range means the market is essentially neutral. The bears therefore have only a slight advantage.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-on-the-monthly-chart-are-in-6-month-tight-trading-range\">Bond futures on the<em><strong>monthly</strong></em><strong>chart</strong>are in 6-month tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-12.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart in tight trading range\"></a></figure><p>The monthly bond futures chart has an inside bar so far in September (its range is within August’s range). Since August was an outside down bar (it traded above the July high and then below its low), there is now an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode setup. There is an equal chance of either a successful bull or bear breakout.<p>This is the 6th month in a tight trading range, which is also a Breakout Mode pattern. I have been saying since the reversal down from March’s buy climax that the monthly chart might go sideways for the rest of the year. It has so far, and there is no sign that this is about to change.<h2 id=\"3-bond-futures-weekly-chart-has-consecutive-bull-bars-but-is-in-a-6-month-tight-trading-range\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart has consecutive bull bars, but is in a 6-month tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-12-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in tight trading range\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures chart has been sideways for 4 weeks. This small tight trading range is in the middle of a 9-month trading range. Traders are deciding if the bond futures will test the June low at the bottom of the range or the August high at the top.<p>This week had a small bull body and last week also had a bull body. This means there is a slightly better chance that next week will trade above this week’s high than below this week’s low.<p>However, the 6 month range has been tight. Traders are taking quick profits and betting on reversals every bar (week) or two. Until there are consecutive big trend bars up or down, traders will continue their range range style of trading (buying low, selling high, and taking quick profits).<h2 id=\"4-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"5-rally-on-the-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-stalled-at-the-september-2018-high\">Rally on the EURUSD<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart has stalled at the September 2018 high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-with-double-top-and-failed-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-12-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart with double top and failed breakout\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex monthly chart traded above the August high and sold off. So far, September is a bear bar. If the EURUSD closes near the low of the month, it will be a sell signal bar.<p>Traders would sell below its low because they are concerned that the strong 4 month rally has stalled at the September 2018 high. The July breakout might be failing. The EURUSD might trade back down to the middle of its 6 year trading range.<p>All year, I have been saying that the September 2018 high would be the target for the bulls. It was the start of the 18 month bear channel that ended in March. Once there was a break above the bear channel, traders expected a test of the beginning of the channel. That is what has been taking place over the past 2 months.<p>The bulls want a strong breakout above the September 2018 high and then a test of the February 2018 bull trend high. However, when there is a break above the top of a bear channel and then a test of the start of the channel, there is typically a leg down. This usually leads to a trading range where the bear channel was the 1st leg down and the reversal down from the start of the bear channel is the 2nd leg down.<p>Traders should expect a 1 to 2-month pullback now that the rally has reached the September 2018 high. But it is important to note that there is a 40% chance that the 4-month rally will continue up to the February 2018 high at around 1.25 without a 1 to 2-month pullback.<h2 id=\"6-the-eurusd-weekly-chart-has-a-nested-wedge-top-but-no-reversal-yet\">The EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart has a nested wedge top, but no reversal yet</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-with-nested-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-12-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart with nested wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart had a very strong rally from the March low. Since it had 3 legs up, it is a wedge buy climax.<p>Buy climaxes can have many legs and go a long way before they end. However, this one has had 3 clear legs up and it has stopped at the important resistance of the September 2018 high. That was the start of the 18 month bear channel that ended with March’s strong reversal up.<p>Traders expect a couple legs sideways to down from here. The first target is the June 10 high. That was the breakout point of the July rally, and there usually is a pullback to test a breakout point.<h3 id=\"7-guidelines-for-a-reversal-down-after-a-bull-streak\">Guidelines for a reversal down after a bull streak</h3><p>The weekly chart had a streak of 7 consecutive bull bars that ended last month. While a streak of 7 bull bars and a 10-bar bull micro channel mean that the bulls are very eager to buy, it is also climactic.<p>Streaks like this happen only every 5 – 10 years. They typically will attract profit takers, especially since this rally stopped at the important resistance of the September 2018 high. The profit taking often leads to a retracement of the entire streak.<p>This streak began at the June 26 low of 1.1169. Given how strong the rally has been, the bears only have a 40% chance of a selloff in the next couple months reaching that level.<h3 id=\"8-guidelines-for-a-selloff-from-a-wedge-rally\">Guidelines for a selloff from a wedge rally</h3><p>A guide for what to expect after a wedge buy climax is at least 2 legs sideways to down. Also, traders will look for about half as many bars as there were in the rally. Since the rally from the March low was 4 – 6 months, depending on what you choose for the start, the pullback will probably last at least a month or two.<p>Can the bull trend resume next week? Probably not. Traders expect more sideways to down trading first. There is only a 30% chance of a leg up from here starting in the next few weeks.<h2 id=\"9-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"10-the-monthly-emini-chart-is-forming-a-bear-reversal-bar-at-the-top-of-an-expanding-triangle\">The<strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart is forming a bear reversal bar at the top of an expanding triangle</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-with-expanding-triangle-top-and-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-12-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart with expanding triangle top and buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart so far has a bear reversal bar in September. August broke above the 3-year trading range. September went above the August high and the top of the 3-year expanding triangle, but reversed down.<p>The bears want the reversal to continue to the March low at the bottom of the triangle. However, after 5 strong bull bars, the best the bears will probably get is a 1 to 2-month pullback.<p>A strong rally typically will not become a bear trend without at least a micro double top. This is especially true when the rally is a reversal up from a sell climax. Traders will buy the 1st selloff, knowing that there is a 60% chance that there will be a rally back up to test the old high.<p>September has retraced more than half of the August range. If it gets below the August low, September will be an outside down bar on the monthly chart. Furthermore, it would probably close the gap below the August low. Both would be signs of heavy profit-taking and of strong bears. Traders would then expect October to trade at least a little lower.<h3 id=\"11-cup-and-handle-likely\">Cup and handle likely</h3><p>The Emini collapsed into the March low and then reversed up strongly. When a sell climaxes reverses up sharply like this, traders want to buy the 1st pullback. The probability is high that there would then be a test of the high.<p>This makes a Cup and Handle buy setup likely within the next few months on the monthly chart. It would also be present on the weekly chart. The sell climax and reversal up formed the cup.<p>The pullback that we are beginning to see will be a bull flag. It will usually lead to a rally back to the old high. That pullback and the rally to the old high is the handle in the Cup and Handle pattern.<p>The bulls want that test of the old high to continue to far above that old high. They see the handle as the 1st of what they hope will be a series of higher lows in a new bull trend.<h3 id=\"12-rally-back-to-september-high-might-form-a-double-top-\">Rally back to September high might form a double top</h3><p>The bears know that traders will buy the 1st pullback. But if the bears can stop the rally at around the old high, traders will look for a possible double top. Many bulls will exit their longs because of a possible double top.<p>And many bears will short. They knew that the 1st reversal down was going to be minor, but a 2nd reversal down has a higher probability of being major. That means the bears would look for a swing down to at least the middle of the 3 year trading range.<p>Does the handle last only 1 – 3 bars? Sometimes, but it will last 20 bars at other times. It is impossible to know in advance. All that we know is that the bulls will buy the 1st pullback, whether it is only 1 bar or 20 bars, expecting a test of the old high (the September 2 high).<h2 id=\"13-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-a-weak-reversal-down-from-a-buy-climax\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a weak reversal down from a buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-with-outside-down-sell-signal-bar-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-12-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart with outside down sell signal bar after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed an outside down bar last week. It was a sell signal bar for this week. This week traded below the low of that outside down bar, triggering the weekly sell signal.<p>However, the sell setup is not strong. It came after a 9-bar bull micro channel. The bulls were so eager to buy that they were buying above the low of the prior week.<p>Also, last week had a big tail on the bottom of the bar and it closed above the low of the week before. That is a sign of a lack of conviction on the part of the sellers.<p>The micro channel and the weak outside down bar reduce the chance of this selloff collapsing from here. It increases the chance that the selloff will be more sideways to down instead of straight down.<p>The weekly chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since the March low. Every pullback lasted only 1 – 2 weeks.<p>Were the past 2 weeks just another small pullback in the bull trend? Probably not. This is because the 9-bar bull micro channel is extreme buying. It is therefore unsustainable and a buy climax. Also, the reversal down is coming at the top of a 3 year expanding triangle.<p>These factors make it likely that the developing pullback will have at least a couple legs sideways to down. It should therefore last at least a few more weeks. Traders will sell the 1st 1 – 3-week bounce, expecting a lower high and a 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>But if the bulls get a couple consecutive big bull bars closing on their highs, traders will conclude that the pullback has ended and the bull trend has resumed. They will then look for a test of the old high and possibly a strong break above the old high. The bulls currently have a 40% chance of this happening.<h2 id=\"14-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-might-bounce-at-50-day-ma-before-falling-below-3200\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart might bounce at 50-day MA before falling below 3200</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-with-2-legs-down-after-buy-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-12-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart with 2 legs down after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart finally poked below the 50-day simple moving average (MA) on Friday. Many bulls thought that the reversal down was strong enough to get there. They did not want to buy until after the Emini fell below that average. It reversed up on Friday, but Friday had a bear body. That is a weak buy signal bar for Monday. Many bulls will wait to buy above a bull bar closing near its high.<p>The bulls hope that the selloff is like all of the others since the March low. It is about 10% down from the high. They hope that the selling stops here and that the 5 month bull trend will quickly resume.<p>But the selling has been strong enough and the buy climax extreme enough that the selloff will probably fall further and last longer. Traders expect a bounce for a few days from around the 50-day MA. It could last longer. However, the bears will sell a rally to 3450 – 3500, knowing that a lower high and 2nd leg down are likely.<h3 id=\"15-selloff-should-reach-3000-3200\">Selloff should reach 3000 – 3200</h3><p>The bears hope that the selloff will continue without a bounce. They want the Emini to break far below the 50-day MA next week. The next MA support on the daily chart is the 100-day MA, which is below 3200.<p>That is also around the bottom of the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars in August. I have been saying that the bottom of a streak is always a magnet. There is usually a reversal down to below the bottom of the streak. With the 100 day MA there as well, there is an additional reason for the Emini to get there.<p>Last year’s close was 3199. Since that is around the bottom of the bull streak and the 100-day MA, that is a 3rd magnet. A cluster of magnets increases the chance that the market will get there.<p>The June trading range came late in the bull trend. It is therefore a possible Final Bull Flag. Its low is a magnet. That low is around the 3000 Big Round Number, and it is also approximately a 20% correction. That is a psychological magnet. If the Emini falls 20%, it is in a bear market. This selloff might have to reach that point before the buyers return.<h2 id=\"16-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

I have been saying that many bulls would not buy until they saw a reversal up from below the 50 day MA.<p>Friday was a reversal day but it had a bear body. In general, the bulls want to buy above a bull bar, especially after a strong selloff. They hope that today closes near its high so that it would be a better buy signal bar.<p>In any case, the bounce from the 50 day MA should test last week’s lower high on the daily chart at a minimum. That is also last week’s high and it is just above the 3400 Big Round Number. A 50% retracement would be around 3450.<p>The bears want the break below the 50 day MA to continue lower. If September trades below the August low, it would be an outside down bar on the monthly chart. That would increase the chance of sideways to down trading in October.<p>August gapped up on the monthly chart, but the gap was small. I said that small gaps usually close shortly after they form. If the Emini goes below the September low, it will probably close the gap.<p>If today closes near its high, it will be a buy signal bar on the daily chart. The bulls would then try to get a rally for several days back to 3450 -3500.<p>But if today closes near its low and far below the 50 day MA, the Emini will probably trade below the August low this week.<p>There is an FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Traders might not be eager to trade aggressively until after the announcement. Also, since the Emini is at important support, it might oscillate around the 50 day MA until Wednesday’s announcement.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex market. It might gap above Friday’s high. There is a micro double bottom at the 50 day MA on the daily chart. Also, the daily chart is oversold. Traders expect the Emini to work high for at least a couple days.<p>If today does gap up, the gap will likely be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>But even if the gap closes, traders expect higher prices for a couple days. Therefore, today is more likely to be a bull trend day or a trading range day than a bear trend day.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the 20 bar EMA, which is a measure of the average price. Traders do not want to pay far above the average price unless the bars are far stronger than average. There is a strong bull or bear trend from the open only 20% of the time.<p>Most of the time, a big gap up leads to a trading range open for an hour or two. The bulls will look for the Emini to go sideways to down to the moving average. They then will buy a reversal up, usually from either a double bottom or wedge bull flag near the EMA.<p>The bears will look for an early rally to fail. They want a double top or wedge top and then a swing down.<p>If there is a trading range open, traders will see the Emini as neutral. That reduces the chance of a trend lasting for the rest of the day. Therefore, they expect a breakout from a trading range open to last for a few hours and then either enter another trading range or reverse.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-sell-climax-and-weak-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-14.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and weak bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-in-middle-of-7-week-tight-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-14-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex in middle of 7 week tight trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market has been sideways for 7 weeks. The bulls want to break above last week’s lower high and then above the top of the range.<p>That lower high is also last week’s high. Last week was a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the weekly chart (not shown) and if this week goes above that high, it will trigger a minor weekly buy signal.<p>But last week was only a doji bar on the weekly chart. That is a weak buy signal bar. Also, the chart has been in a tight range for 7 weeks. That is a bad context for traders looking for the start of a trend.<p>Instead, most traders will assume that there will be more sellers than buyers above that weekly buy signal bar and daily lower high from 2 days ago. They know trading ranges resist breaking out and expect reversals instead of the start of a trend.<p>On the daily chart, today went above Friday’s high and triggered a minor High 1 bull flag buy signal. This will probably lead to a test of last week’s high within a couple days.<p>Wednesday’s FOMC announcement is a potential catalyst for a breakout up or down. But with the presidential election just a couple months away, the Fed will probably not say anything that will affect the financial markets.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above Friday’s high and triggered a High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. But the EURUSD is in the middle of an 8 week tight trading range and reversals are more common than big breakouts. This is probably not the resumption of the July bull trend. It is more likely just another one of many small legs up and down in the 8 week tight trading range.<p>Today so far is the 4th consecutive bull bar and Thursday’s lower high is a magnet above. Traders expect the EURUSD to work up to that high today or tomorrow.<p>Even though today is trending up, it is doing so in a bull channel. While it is always easier for a day trader to make money buying pullbacks when there is a bull trend, the bears will also sell reversals down for scalps.<p>The day’s range is small and so are the legs. Day traders have been scalping up and down for 10 pips while they wait for a breakout up or down. If there is a breakout, up is more likely than down after 3 bull days and with a magnet above (Thursday’s lower high).<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-then-trending-trading-range-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax and then trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The selloff lasted most of the day and today was a Bear Trending Trading Range Day. The bulls got some trend resumption back up at the end of the day after a test of the 60 minute EMA.<p>I have been saying that the Emini would probably bounce for a few days from the 50 day MA on the daily chart. Additionally, I have said it will likely go above last week’s high and reach 3400 – 3500. At that point, traders will look for a lower high and then a 2nd leg down. It should fall to 3000 – 3200 within the next month or two.<p>Today was probably the start of the bounce, but the Emini might 1st go sideways into Wednesday’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement.

I have been saying that many bulls would not buy until they saw a reversal up from below the 50 day MA.<p>Friday was a reversal day but it had a bear body. In general, the bulls want to buy above a bull bar, especially after a strong selloff. They hope that today closes near its high so that it would be a better buy signal bar.<p>In any case, the bounce from the 50 day MA should test last week’s lower high on the daily chart at a minimum. That is also last week’s high and it is just above the 3400 Big Round Number. A 50% retracement would be around 3450.<p>The bears want the break below the 50 day MA to continue lower. If September trades below the August low, it would be an outside down bar on the monthly chart. That would increase the chance of sideways to down trading in October.<p>August gapped up on the monthly chart, but the gap was small. I said that small gaps usually close shortly after they form. If the Emini goes below the September low, it will probably close the gap.<p>If today closes near its high, it will be a buy signal bar on the daily chart. The bulls would then try to get a rally for several days back to 3450 -3500.<p>But if today closes near its low and far below the 50 day MA, the Emini will probably trade below the August low this week.<p>There is an FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Traders might not be eager to trade aggressively until after the announcement. Also, since the Emini is at important support, it might oscillate around the 50 day MA until Wednesday’s announcement.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex market. It might gap above Friday’s high. There is a micro double bottom at the 50 day MA on the daily chart. Also, the daily chart is oversold. Traders expect the Emini to work high for at least a couple days.<p>If today does gap up, the gap will likely be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>But even if the gap closes, traders expect higher prices for a couple days. Therefore, today is more likely to be a bull trend day or a trading range day than a bear trend day.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the 20 bar EMA, which is a measure of the average price. Traders do not want to pay far above the average price unless the bars are far stronger than average. There is a strong bull or bear trend from the open only 20% of the time.<p>Most of the time, a big gap up leads to a trading range open for an hour or two. The bulls will look for the Emini to go sideways to down to the moving average. They then will buy a reversal up, usually from either a double bottom or wedge bull flag near the EMA.<p>The bears will look for an early rally to fail. They want a double top or wedge top and then a swing down.<p>If there is a trading range open, traders will see the Emini as neutral. That reduces the chance of a trend lasting for the rest of the day. Therefore, they expect a breakout from a trading range open to last for a few hours and then either enter another trading range or reverse.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-sell-climax-and-weak-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-14.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and weak bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Even though it is likely working down to below 3200, it is oversold and at support. It therefore should bounce this week to 3450 – 3500 before resuming down. Tomorrow’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement is a potential catalyst for a big move up or down.<p>Last week was a High 1 buy signal bar on the weekly chart. I have been saying that this week would probably go above last week’s high and trigger the buy signal. That will probably happen today.<p>But I also said that last week’s candlestick was a bear bar, which is a weak buy signal bar. Furthermore, it followed an outside down bar at the top of a 3 year bull channel. Also, there were climactic streaks of 7 and 9 consecutive bull days on the daily chart.<p>This is bad context for the resumption of the bull trend. Traders expect a lower high and a 2nd leg sideways to down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. It might gap above yesterday’s high. But a small gap typically closes early in the session and is usually only a minor event.<p>While the Emini is in the middle of its 5 day trading range, traders expect it to work higher. It could go a little above the top of the range at around 3500.<p>However, because it is in a trading range on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of more trading range price action on the 5 minute chart. Day traders expect at least one leg up and one leg down today.<p>Yesterday rallied and then sold off in a bear channel. A bear channel is a bull flag. Today was likely to break above the channel.<p>The fight today will be over last week’s close. Will the Emini break far above, increasing the chance of the rally continuing to above 3500 over the next week? Or, will the Emini stall around last week’s high and form a small double top bear flag on the daily chart?<p>In either case, traders will probably wait for tomorrow’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement to decide if the rally is ending this week or continuing to 3500.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-then-trending-trading-range-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-15.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax and then trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is important to note that it has been in a tight trading range for 7 weeks. That is not possible unless the bulls and bears are balanced. Therefore, while 5 bull days is good for the bulls, there is no breakout yet. Traders still believe that the 5 day rally is more likely going to form a lower high than successfully break above the range.<p>Just look back at the 5 bull days in August. They broke to a new high, but then the EURUSD reversed down in a bear leg in the range.<p>Five consecutive bull days, assuming today remains a bull day, make at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up likely. Therefore, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>Tomorrow’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement is a potential catalyst for a big move up or down. It slightly increases the chance of a break above or below the range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to above yesterday’s high, but then entered a 25 pip tall trading range for 10 hours. Also, the entire day’s range has been small. Day traders are continuing to scalp for 10 pips up and down while they wait for a breakout.<p>Will today remain a bull day on the daily chart, or will it close on its low and form a sell signal bar for a lower high? With the range as small as it has been overnight, the EURUSD does not need a big move up or down to form either a bull day closing on its high or a bear day closing on its low.<p>However, each of those possibilities affect the probability for tomorrow’s direction. The bulls will try to get the day to close on the high and the bears want to get it to close on the low.<p>With the small range, there is no conviction. Day traders so far are just scalping, betting that the range will remain small.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-triangle-open-then-bear-breakout-and-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle open then bear breakout and wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bears got a breakout that closed the gap on the daily chart. Traders bought a reversal up from wedge bottom sell climax to the 60 minute EMA. Today closed just below the open. It was a doji bar on the daily chart and a weak sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Because the daily chart is so oversold and the 5 month rally was so strong, traders expect more of a bounce before there is a 2nd leg down. Whether or not there is a bounce, traders expect the selloff to continue to 3000 – 3200. If there is a bounce, the Emini should test 3450 – 3500.<p>Tomorrow is the final FOMC meeting before the election. The Fed will not do anything different because it does not want to influence the election. However, traders should be prepared for anything after the announcement at 11 am PST. The market could trend up or down strongly, or reverse.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders expect a lower high and a 2nd leg sideways to down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. It might gap above yesterday’s high. But a small gap typically closes early in the session and is usually only a minor event.<p>While the Emini is in the middle of its 5 day trading range, traders expect it to work higher. It could go a little above the top of the range at around 3500.<p>However, because it is in a trading range on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of more trading range price action on the 5 minute chart. Day traders expect at least one leg up and one leg down today.<p>Yesterday rallied and then sold off in a bear channel. A bear channel is a bull flag. Today was likely to break above the channel.<p>The fight today will be over last week’s close. Will the Emini break far above, increasing the chance of the rally continuing to above 3500 over the next week? Or, will the Emini stall around last week’s high and form a small double top bear flag on the daily chart?<p>In either case, traders will probably wait for tomorrow’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement to decide if the rally is ending this week or continuing to 3500.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-then-trending-trading-range-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-15.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax and then trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is important to note that it has been in a tight trading range for 7 weeks. That is not possible unless the bulls and bears are balanced. Therefore, while 5 bull days is good for the bulls, there is no breakout yet. Traders still believe that the 5 day rally is more likely going to form a lower high than successfully break above the range.<p>Just look back at the 5 bull days in August. They broke to a new high, but then the EURUSD reversed down in a bear leg in the range.<p>Five consecutive bull days, assuming today remains a bull day, make at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up likely. Therefore, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>Tomorrow’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement is a potential catalyst for a big move up or down. It slightly increases the chance of a break above or below the range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to above yesterday’s high, but then entered a 25 pip tall trading range for 10 hours. Also, the entire day’s range has been small. Day traders are continuing to scalp for 10 pips up and down while they wait for a breakout.<p>Will today remain a bull day on the daily chart, or will it close on its low and form a sell signal bar for a lower high? With the range as small as it has been overnight, the EURUSD does not need a big move up or down to form either a bull day closing on its high or a bear day closing on its low.<p>However, each of those possibilities affect the probability for tomorrow’s direction. The bulls will try to get the day to close on the high and the bears want to get it to close on the low.<p>With the small range, there is no conviction. Day traders so far are just scalping, betting that the range will remain small.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-triangle-open-then-bear-breakout-and-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle open then bear breakout and wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bears got a breakout that closed the gap on the daily chart. Traders bought a reversal up from wedge bottom sell climax to the 60 minute EMA. Today closed just below the open. It was a doji bar on the daily chart and a weak sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Because the daily chart is so oversold and the 5 month rally was so strong, traders expect more of a bounce before there is a 2nd leg down. Whether or not there is a bounce, traders expect the selloff to continue to 3000 – 3200. If there is a bounce, the Emini should test 3450 – 3500.<p>Tomorrow is the final FOMC meeting before the election. The Fed will not do anything different because it does not want to influence the election. However, traders should be prepared for anything after the announcement at 11 am PST. The market could trend up or down strongly, or reverse.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls are trying to break above last week’s high and then test 3500. But the bears want a double top with Thursday’s high (last week’s high) and then a selloff to 3000 – 3200. The Emini should fall below 3200, but it might 1st test 3500.<p>There is an FOMC announcement today at 11 am PST. Ahead of the meeting, today will be a normal day. Traders will treat the report as a restart to the day.<p>Day traders should exit positions ahead of the announcement. There is typically both a sharp move up and down within the 1st few minutes of the report. Day traders should wait at least 10 minutes before resuming their trading to avoid that early whipsaw.<p>Traders should always be open to anything after an FOMC announcement. There can be a strong trend up or down, a reversal, or a trading range.<p>Ignore what the Fed does. Simply trade what is on the chart in front of you. That tells you how the institutions view the report.<h3>Last week’s high is a magnet</h3><p>Thursday’s high (last week’s high) is resistance and the bears want a reversal down from a double top on the daily chart. But it is not the start of the trading range price action that formed during the 3 day collapse on the 60 minute chart. That began on September 3, just below 3500, and that is why I have been saying that this rally might continue up to 3450 – 3500. Many traders want to see it tested before concluding that there will be a 2nd leg down to 3000 – 3200 or a resumption of the 5 month bull trend and then a new high. The 3 day rally is the start of the test.<p>Also, last week is a High 1 buy signal bar on the weekly chart in a bull trend. It is a bear bar and it followed an outside down bar at the top of a 3 year expanding triangle. Consequently, a break above last week’s high will probably not get too far. However, traders expect a break above last week’s high. They will probably get it today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 18 points on the Globex session. It will probably gap above yesterday’s high and open around last week’s high.<p>Traders expect at least a small break above that high today. Since last week is a weak buy signal bar on the weekly chart, a break above last week’s high will probably not lead to aggressive buying. Also, the Emini is at the top of a 6 day trading range and reversals are more common than breakouts. Consequently, there is a smaller chance of a huge bull breakout today than in other Breakout Mode situations.<p>Finally, many traders will wait for today’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement before trading aggressively up or down. Day traders will treat today like any other day ahead of the announcement. With a lot of recent trading range price action, they expect at least one leg up and one leg down this morning.<p>They should get flat before the announcement and then wait about 10 minutes after the 11 am PST announcement before looking to trade again.<p>Finally, they should be open to anything and assume that everything is equally likely. That means a trend up or down, a reversal, or a trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-triangle-open-then-bear-breakout-and-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-16.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle open then bear breakout and wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It has been stuck in a tight trading range for 7 weeks. This is at the resistance of the September 2018 high.<p>While the 4 month rally was strong, there is a wedge buy climax on the weekly chart. The bulls are hoping to work off the climactic buying by going sideways rather than down. They expect another leg up to the February 2018 high at around 1.25 to begin soon.<p>The bears, however, know that a wedge top to resistance typically leads to enough profit taking to create a couple legs down. They expect a break below the 7 week range and then a measured move down to below the breakout point of the July rally. That is the June 10 high of 1.1422.<h3>A trading range is a neutral market</h3><p>When the market is in a trading range, it is neutral. This is especially true when the range lasts 20 or more bars and it tight, like this one.<p>This is a Breakout Mode situation. Traders know that there is a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout or a bear breakout.<p>Today’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement is another potential catalyst. However, there have been other catalysts over the past couple months, yet the trading range has continued. Traders will keep betting on reversals until there is a clear breakout up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight sold off a little, rallied, and now pulled back. While the overnight session has been in a weak bull trend, the range is small. Also, the EURUSD has been sideways in a tight range for 4 days. It has been in a 25 pip range for 5 hours. Day traders are mostly looking for scalps.<p>Since all financial markets tend to enter trading ranges ahead of FOMC announcements, day traders expect the EURUSD to stay quiet until today’s 11 am PST report. At that time, there is often a sharp move up or down.<p>But with the EURUSD in a very tight range for 4 days and in a tight range for 7 weeks, traders are not expecting a big trend today after the announcement. But if there is a series of 2 or 3 big trend bars up or down, they will swing trade. Until then, they will scalp.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-from-nested-wedge-on-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal from nested wedge on FOMC announcement\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That increases the chance of more confusion and trading range trading tomorrow.<p>By going above last week’s high, the Emini triggered a weekly High 1 buy signal. However, the signal was weak and the Emini reversed down.<p>On the daily chart, last week’s high was Thursday’s high. The bears see today as a failed breakout above Thursday’s high. There is now a small higher high double top with Thursday’s high.<p>Today reversed down from above yesterday’s high to below yesterday’s low. It is therefore an outside down day and a sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Since there are targets above on the 60 minute chart up to around 3500, the bear rally still might go higher before there is a 2nd leg down to 3000 – 3200 on the daily chart. However, traders will sell rallies, confident of a move down below 3200 soon.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There is now a small higher high double top with Thursday’s high.<p>Today reversed down from above yesterday’s high to below yesterday’s low. It is therefore an outside down day and a sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Since there are targets above on the 60 minute chart up to around 3500, the bear rally still might go higher before there is a 2nd leg down to 3000 – 3200 on the daily chart.

But the setup was weak because last week was a bear bar after an outside down bar. Furthermore, the Emini reversed down from the top of a 3 year expanding triangle top 2 weeks ago. Finally, there were streaks of 7 and 9 consecutive bull bars in August and traders expect a pullback to below the low of both.<p>Yesterday was an outside down day. There is now a small double top with last Thursdays high. The bears are hoping that this will lead to a break below the September low and then a move down to 3000 – 3200.<p>I have mentioned a few times that September might trade below the August low after reversing down from above the August high. It would then be an outside down month on the monthly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices in October.<p>Because the Emini is still in the 2 week trading range, it still might work its way up to 3450 – 3500. Whether or not it does, traders expect the reversal down from 2 weeks ago to continue down to 3000 – 3200 before there is a new high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 58 points in the Globex session. Today will open with a big gap down.<p>When there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the 20 bar EMA. Day traders will only sell far below the average price if the early bars are far above average in terms of their bearishness. They want to see 2 or more consecutive bear bars closing on their lows.<p>The bulls want the opposite. They want to see a couple consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs. If they get that, they then hope that today will trend up.<p>Most of the time, a big gap down leads to confusion. Has the gap already fully priced in the bearish news? This typically results in a trading range for the 1st hour or two. The bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom for a swing up. The bears want to sell closer to the average price. They look for a wedge bear flag or a double top near the 20 bar EMA.<p>If there is a trading range open, it is a sign of balance between the bulls and bears. It reduces the chance that a breakout from the range will lead to a trend that lasts for the rest of the day. More often, there is some more trading range price action later in the day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-from-nested-wedge-on-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-17.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal from nested wedge on FOMC announcement\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is a head and shoulders top over the past 5 weeks. So far, today is a failed breakout below the neck line. Traders expected that since most trading range breakouts fail.<p>However, if today reverses back down and closes far below the range, traders will believe that a reversal down to the June 10 high is underway. It is more likely that attempts to break out of a trading range reverse and the trading range continues.<p>The bulls see today as a 2nd leg down from the September 1 high. For them, it is a pullback in a bull trend. If today closes near its high, today will be a buy signal bar for a High 2 bull flag.<p>But while the bulls want a break above the range, they know that it is more likely that the best they will get is a bounce for a few days. They can see that the EURUSD has had many legs up and down for 7 weeks and each has reversed after about a week. There is no reason to assume that a rally from here will be different.<h3>Today will probably be a weak buy signal bar</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to just below the bottom of the 7 week trading range and then reversed up. The bulls want today to close near its high. In addition, they want it to close far above the open and have a big bull body. Today would then be a more reliable buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The bears want today to close below the bottom of the range, back at the low of the day. They then want tomorrow to be a 2nd consecutive close below the range. If they get that, traders will conclude that a reversal down is underway.<p>What is most likely? In a trading range, traders expect weak buy and sell signals and bad follow-through after breakout attempts. Therefore, today will probably close above the low of the trading range and disappoint the bears. In addition, it will probably close in the upper half of the day’s range, which would make it a reversal day on the daily chart. But it will probably not have a big bull body, which will disappoint the bulls.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD has been in a 35 pip range for the past 5 hours. Traders are deciding if the reversal up from the overnight low will continue to far above the open.<p>It is more likely that today will not get more than 30 pips from the open for the remainder of the day. Day traders have switched to scalping 5 hours ago and will continue to scalp unless the bars get bigger and there is a series of strong trend bars up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini breakout above triangle at 50 day MA\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today is now a buy signal bar for tomorrow on the daily chart.<p>The Emini tested the 50 day MA many times today after turning down from a small double top bear flag on the daily chart yesterday. Traders are deciding if the 50 day MA will be support and lead to a break above the 2 week trading range.<p>The bears see these 2 weeks as a bear flag.

But it reversed up from the 50 day MA, and yesterday is now a buy signal bar for today for a double bottom bull flag. It is still in its 2 week trading range, which is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>The bulls see the 2 week trading range as a bull flag at the 50 day MA in a 5 month bull trend. But the bears see it as a bear flag in a bear trend that began on September 2.<p>Traders are deciding if the 50 day MA will hold. If it does, there could be a rally to 3500 before the selloff continues down to 3000 – 3200. However, the Emini should reach that downside target before there is a new high.<p>Today is the last day of the week. The bears want the week to close on its low. It would then be a Low 1 sell signal bar for next week.<p>Also, they would like a break below last week’s low today. This week would then be an outside down candlestick on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>Finally, the bears want September to trade below the August low. It would then be on outside down bar on the monthly chart as well. That would increase the chance of lower prices in October.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. It is trading in the middle of its 2 week range. Traders are wondering if it will reverse up from the 50 day MA or break below.<p>The bulls want to trigger the buy signal on the daily chart by going above yesterday’s high. However, yesterday has a prominent tail on top and the Emini is in the middle of a 2 week range. That lowers the chance of a big bull trend day.<p>Yesterday reversed up 3 times from the 50 day MA. That lowers the probability of a big bear trend day.<p>Traders could be exhausted by this week’s reversals in the 2 week range. They might decide to continue yesterday’s trading range trading today and wait for next week to decide on the direction of the breakout of the 2 week range. Even if today is a trading range day, the recent daily ranges have been big. There will therefore probably be at least one swing trade up and one swing trade down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-breakout-above-triangle-at-50-day-MA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-18.png\" alt=\"Emini breakout above triangle at 50 day MA\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Also, they will take quick profits. That perpetuates the trading range.<p>Today went above yesterday’s high and therefore triggered the double bottom buy signal. However, the overnight range has been small. The bears hope that yesterday and today are forming a brief pullback in a bear trend that began with the September 1 high. This is a neutral market with no sign that it is about to convert into a trend up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight traded above yesterday’s high to trigger a double bottom buy signal on the daily chart. However, the breakout was small and the EURUSD immediately pulled back to yesterday’s high. It has been oscillating around yesterday’s high in a small range all day. Day traders are looking for reversals and are scalping.<p>It is also at the open of the week. Last week closed almost exactly at the open and this created a doji bar on the weekly chart. This week is also a doji bar. That means that the weekly chart has been perfectly neutral for 2 weeks.<p>If today closes on its low, it would be a sell signal bar for Monday. The bears would see yesterday’s reversal up as a pullback from the break below the neckline of the head and shoulders top on the daily chart. If it closes on its high, the bulls will be hopeful that this is the start of a rally to the top of the range.<p>But if the range stays small and today closes near the open of the week, today will not have any predictive value for next week. so far, there is no sign that today convert into a trend up or down. But if there are 2 or 3 consecutive big trend bars in either direction, day traders will switch to swing trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bear-trend-and-sell-climax-then-trend-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend and sell climax then trend reversal up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But it reversed up from the 50 day MA, and yesterday is now a buy signal bar for today for a double bottom bull flag. It is still in its 2 week trading range, which is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>The bulls see the 2 week trading range as a bull flag at the 50 day MA in a 5 month bull trend. But the bears see it as a bear flag in a bear trend that began on September 2.<p>Traders are deciding if the 50 day MA will hold. If it does, there could be a rally to 3500 before the selloff continues down to 3000 – 3200. However, the Emini should reach that downside target before there is a new high.<p>Today is the last day of the week. The bears want the week to close on its low. It would then be a Low 1 sell signal bar for next week.<p>Also, they would like a break below last week’s low today. This week would then be an outside down candlestick on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>Finally, the bears want September to trade below the August low. It would then be on outside down bar on the monthly chart as well. That would increase the chance of lower prices in October.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. It is trading in the middle of its 2 week range. Traders are wondering if it will reverse up from the 50 day MA or break below.<p>The bulls want to trigger the buy signal on the daily chart by going above yesterday’s high. However, yesterday has a prominent tail on top and the Emini is in the middle of a 2 week range. That lowers the chance of a big bull trend day.<p>Yesterday reversed up 3 times from the 50 day MA. That lowers the probability of a big bear trend day.<p>Traders could be exhausted by this week’s reversals in the 2 week range. They might decide to continue yesterday’s trading range trading today and wait for next week to decide on the direction of the breakout of the 2 week range. Even if today is a trading range day, the recent daily ranges have been big. There will therefore probably be at least one swing trade up and one swing trade down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-breakout-above-triangle-at-50-day-MA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-18.png\" alt=\"Emini breakout above triangle at 50 day MA\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

id=\"0-market-overview-weekend-market-analysis\">Market Overview: Weekend Market Analysis</h2><p>The<strong>SP500 Emini</strong>futures formed an outside down candlestick week and September might become an outside down month. Traders will sell rallies, expecting the selloff to reach 3,000 – 3,200.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are in the middle of a 6 month tight trading range. Traders are looking for reversals every few days.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has stalled for 7 weeks at the September 2018 high. It is neutral. But because the rally on the weekly chart was climactic and a wedge, the odds slightly favor a pullback instead of a bull breakout.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-monthly-chart-is-in-a-6-month-tight-trading-range\">Bond futures<em><strong>monthly</strong></em><strong>chart</strong>is in a 6 month tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-19.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart in tight trading range after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>This month’s candlestick on the monthly bond futures chart has a low above last month’s low and a high below last month’s high. It is therefore an inside bar. Last month was an outside bar. There is an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode setup. If September remains an inside bar, it will be both a buy and a sell signal bar for October. If it continues to have a bull body, traders will be more willing to buy above its high than sell below its low.<p>The most dramatic 3 month buy climax in history ended in March. The past 6 months have been sideways. Traders are deciding whether the small trading range is a bull flag or a pause on the way down to a bigger correction.<p>With the 6 bars all overlapping one another, traders see the monthly chart as neutral. There is an equal chance of a bull or bear breakout of the range.<p>However, most breakouts of tight trading ranges fail. Look at the failed bear breakout in June and the failed bull breakout in July. Therefore, until there is a successful breakout, the most likely path is sideways.<h2 id=\"3-bond-futures-daily-chart-has-a-double-top-and-a-head-and-shoulders-bottom\">Bond futures<strong><em>daily</em></strong>chart has a double top and a head and shoulders bottom</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bond-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-with-double-top-and-head-and-shoulders-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-19-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures daily candlestick chart with double top and head and shoulders bottom\"></a></figure><p>The daily bond futures chart has been sideways for a month. There are lower highs and higher lows. This is a triangle, which is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Traders know that a successful bull breakout is as likely as a successful bear breakout. Furthermore, they know that the 1st breakout of a triangle has a 50% chance of failing.<p>Also, once there is a successful breakout, the market tends to come back to the apex of the triangle after 10 – 20 bars. Why? Because both the bulls and the bears see the current price as fair. Once bonds break out, traders will wonder if the price is unfair. They usually want to see what happens after testing back to the triangle. Will the 1st breakout resume or will the bond market now break out in the opposite direction?<p>Until there is a breakout, traders will bet on reversals every few days. For traders to conclude that a breakout will be successful and last 2 or more weeks, they want to see confirmation. That usually means consecutive closes above or below the triangle.<h2 id=\"4-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-weekly-chart-has-a-wedge-rally-at-resistance\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart has a wedge rally at resistance</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-nested-wedge-top-and-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-19-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has nested wedge top and double top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart has been sideways in a tight range for 7 weeks. Each bar has largely overlapped all of the other bars. This is a Breakout Mode pattern. Traders assume that there is about a 50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout.<p>The bulls see the trading range as a bull flag in a 5 month bull trend. They want the EURUSD to break strongly above the resistance of the September 2018 high and continue up to the February 2018 high at around 1.25. That was the end of a strong, yearlong rally and the start of a 2-year bear trend.<p>The bears know that the rally from the March low has been exceptionally strong. But because it has had 3 clear legs up, it is a wedge bull channel. The bears know that a wedge often attracts profit-taking.<p>At a minimum, they are looking for a reversal down to the June 10 high, which was the breakout point of the July rally. Markets tend to come back to test breakout points. Traders want to see if the bulls will buy aggressively again at the June 10 high, like they did in July. Or, will there be more sellers than buyers there? If so, traders will expect the pullback to continue down to the next support.<p>That is the June 26 low. The EURUSD went sideways there for 5 weeks. A small trading range late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. It is a magnet once the bull trend finally ends.<p>Less likely, there will be a reversal down from the wedge that retraces the entire rally and possibly breaks below the March low.<h3 id=\"6-what-is-most-likely-over-the-next-several-weeks\">What is most likely over the next several weeks?</h3><p>I said that the probability is about the same for the bulls and the bears. However, a wedge rally to a double top (with the September 2018) high is a reliable pattern. It is probably more important than the momentum up from the March low. Therefore, the bear case and a test of the June 10 high is slightly more likely than another leg up to the February 2018 high.<h2 id=\"7-eurusd-daily-chart-has-a-head-and-shoulders-top-and-a-triangle-bull-flag\">EURUSD<strong><em>daily</em></strong>chart has a head and shoulders top and a triangle bull flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-has-nested-wedge-top-and-double-top-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-19-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart has nested wedge top and double top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD daily chart has been in a tight trading range for 7 weeks. There have been many small legs up and down and minor breakouts up and down. Traders will continue to look for reversals every week or so until there is a clear, strong breakout in either direction.<p>The bulls got a reversal up on Thursday after a failed breakout below the September 9 low. That low is the neckline of a head and shoulders top with the highs of August 18, September 1, and September 10. Traders expected the breakout to fail because most breakouts fail. Even a perfect head and shoulders top only has a 40% chance of actually leading to a reversal from a bull trend to a bear trend.<p>Will this reversal up lead to a successful breakout above the trading range? Probably not because, as I said, most breakouts fail. Traders will look for reversals and take quick profits as long as the trading range continues. There is nothing to indicate that a breakout is imminent.<h2 id=\"8-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"9-monthly-emini-chart-could-have-an-outside-down-candlestick-in-september\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart could have an outside down candlestick in September</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-reversing-down-from-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-19-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart reversing down from top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart so far has a bear body in September. There are 8 trading days remaining in the month and the candlestick could look very different on September 30. It could even have a bull body, but that is unlikely.<p>If September trades below the August low, it would be an outside down month. That would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices in October. That would probably also close the gap below the August low.<p>If September does not go outside down, but closes on the low of the month, September would be a sell signal bar for October. Traders would expect a minor reversal down for a month or two.<h3 id=\"10-minor-reversal-down-likely\">Minor reversal down likely</h3><p>The Emini had a dramatic 5-month rally through August. It was strong enough to make traders confident that the current reversal down will be minor. It could last a couple months, but there is only a 30% chance of a strong reversal down to the March low without first forming a trading range.<p>Trading ranges have legs that go down and legs that go up. Trader believe that the developing selloff will more likely be a leg in what will become a trading range or bull flag than the start of a bear trend. This is true even if the selloff retraces half of the 5-month rally. Traders would need to see 3 consecutive big bear bars closing on their lows before they would believe that there is a reasonable chance of a trend reversal.<h3 id=\"11-3-years-into-a-decade-of-sideways-trading\">3 years into a decade of sideways trading</h3><p>How high will the bull trend go? Since 2017, I have been saying that the stock market would probably be sideways for a decade between approximately 2000 and 4000. This is because the 2017 rally was the most extreme buy climax in the history of the stock market on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<p>The bulls are hoping that the past 3 years were enough of a pause for the 10 year bull trend to resume. I don’t think so. With the most extreme buy climax in history, the market will probably have to correct like it did in the late 1960’s and after 2000. Both of those corrections lasted about a decade. And both had a least a couple 40% selloffs. In 2009, there was a 58% selloff.<h3 id=\"12-a-decade-long-trading-range-is-bad-for-investors-but-good-for-traders\">A decade-long trading range is bad for investors but good for traders</h3><p>While a trading range for 10 years is bad for investors who buy and hold, it is great for traders. If a trader waits for a 20 – 30% correction in the Emini, a stock that he wants to buy that was 100 might now be 60.<p>A couple years later, the Emini is back at the high at the top of the developing trading range, and his stock is testing its old high at 100. That $40 increase in his stock is a 67% profit in two years.<p>While this sounds easy, it is virtually impossible to consistently do it. However, if a trader does not catch the exact bottom and top, and buys at 70 and sells 2 years later at 90, he still made 28%. Good for traders.<h2 id=\"13-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-working-lower-after-buy-climax\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart working lower after buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-outside-down-reversal-from-breakout-above-February-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-19-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has outside down reversal from breakout above February high\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed down 3 weeks ago from the top of a 3 year expanding triangle. The reversal came with an outside down bar. However, that bar had a big tail below and a close above the low of the prior week. Additionally, it was in a 9-bar bull micro channel. The reversal down will therefore likely be minor. A trading range is more likely than a bear trend. That is still true.<p>Last week traded below the low of that outside down bar. That triggered the weekly sell signal. But instead of a big bear bar closing on its low, the candlestick had a small bear body and prominent tails. That is not how strong bear trends typically begin.<p>This week traded above last week’s high and then below its low. This is therefore another outside down week. But it closed above last week’s low and it has a prominent tail below.<p>While traders expect lower prices, all 3 bear bars have prominent tails. That reduces the bearishness of the reversal down. It increases the chance of a 1 – 2 week bounce before the pullback is done.<h3 id=\"14-bad-high-1-bull-flag-buy-signal\">Bad High 1 bull flag buy signal</h3><p>Because last week was a pullback in a strong bull trend, it was a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for this week. But it had a bear body and it followed a bear outside down bar in a buy climax at resistance. That is why I wrote last week that there would probably be more sellers that buyers above the high of the bar.<p>This week traded above last week’s high and therefore triggered the weekly buy signal. But like I said was likely, there were more sellers than buyers above the bar, and this week quickly reversed down.<p>I have been saying for several months that the reversal up in March was so strong that traders would buy the 1st pullback. But the pullback could continue for several more weeks. Traders are waiting to buy a credible bottom. However, they know that the Emini might have to fall to below 3000 before it resumes back up.<h3 id=\"15-cup-and-handle-buy-setup-likely-will-form\">Cup and handle buy setup likely will form</h3><p>I have said that a cup and handle buy setup should form within the next couple months. When there is a sell climax, like in March, and then a strong reversal up, traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. That means they will buy that 1st pullback.<p>The March selloff and the 5 month reversal up is the cup. The developing pullback is the handle. The handle can last 20 or more bars and can retrace half of the rally. It could also be brief and shallow. It is too early to tell what it will look like. However, we do know that the bulls are looking to buy the pullback.<p>After the sharp selloff from an extreme buy climax to resistance, the pullback should have at least a couple small legs down. It could last a couple months. But once the selling dries up and the market goes sideways for a few weeks, the bulls will look to buy above a bull bar closing near its high. They expect a test of the September 2nd all-time high.<h2 id=\"16-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-selling-off-to-3000-3200\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures selling off to 3000 – 3200</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-expanding-triangle-after-climactic-reversal-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-19-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has expanding triangle after climactic reversal down\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been sideways for 2 weeks after a sharp reversal down from an extreme buy climax. On Friday, the Emini broke below the range. But it closed back in the range and therefore there is no convincing breakout yet.<p>There are many ways to decide that a market is in a buy climax. The daily chart has a fairly reliable one. There were 9 consecutive bull trend bars through August 10 and then a second streak of 7 bars through August 28.<p>Streaks like this usually result in profit-taking and therefore are buy climaxes. For example, the last time there were 9 consecutive bull days was in January 2018. The Emini rallied for a couple more weeks and then reversed down to far below the bottom of the streak.<p>The current selloff has already dropped below the bottom of the August 28 streak. Traders should expect it to get down to below the bottom of the August 10 streak before there is a new high. The bottom of that streak was the July 20 low of 3184.75, or about 3200. That low is also just below last year’s close. If the Emini gets there, it will have erased all of 2020’s gains.<h3 id=\"17-june-trading-range-might-be-a-final-bull-flag\">June trading range might be a Final Bull Flag</h3><p>There was a trading range in June that came fairly late in the rally from the March low. It is therefore a good candidate for a Final Bull Flag. Its low is therefore a magnet. The June 15 low was 2942.25. That is why I have been saying that it is reasonable to think that the selloff could continue down to 3000.<p>Also, that is where the extremely tight, 2-month bull channel began. A tight bull channel is a buy climax. Once there is a reversal down from a buy climax, the start of the buy climax is a downside target. This is another reason why the Emini could fall to 3000.<h3 id=\"18-numbers-can-be-psychological-magnets\">Numbers can be psychological magnets</h3><p>Markets often get drawn to certain numbers, like the 3000 Big Round Number. That is 18% down from the high. Eighteen percent is close to 20%. Twenty percent is a psychological magnet because if a market falls 20%, it is no longer just in a correction. It is now in a bear market.<p>Support and resistance are magnets. Like a magnet, the pull is much greater when you get very close. Therefore, if the Emini falls 18%, it will probably continue down to 20%, which is 2861.<p>That is just below the April 29 high, which was the breakout point for the May rally. Breakout points are also magnets.<h3 id=\"19-where-will-the-emini-go-next\">Where will the Emini go next?</h3><p>At the moment, before there is a new high, there is a 60% chance that the Emini will fall to 3200, a 50% chance it will fall to 3000, and a 40% chance it will fall 20% to 2861.<p>What about the other direction? There is a 40% chance that the Emini will rally to a new high before falling to 3200. However, there is close to a 50% chance that it will reverse up from the bottom of bottom of the 2-week trading range next week as the bulls try to prevent a strong bear close for September.<p>Remember, the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 weeks. Every trading range has both a reasonable buy and sell setup. In this case, the bears have a double top. The bulls have a possible expanding triangle bull flag, but there is no buy signal bar yet.<p>Trading ranges are neutral. This one is slightly more bearish because it formed after a reversal down from an extreme buy climax and it has not yet reached important magnets as well.<p>However, just because you know the destination does not mean you know the path. If you take an airport shuttle from Times Square to JFK, you know you will end up at JFK, but you don’t know how many other stops the van will make before you get there.<p>A bear breakout is slightly more likely than a bull breakout, but the selloff has not been particularly strong after the 1st 2 big bear days. The Emini might have to go higher to find more aggressive sellers.<p>But even if it breaks strongly above the 2 week range, it will probably form a lower high at around 3500 and then resume down to the targets below. Therefore, a breakout above the trading range will likely fail to lead to a new high.<h2 id=\"20-rbg\">RBG</h2><h3 id=\"21-election-turmoil-is-likely\">Election turmoil is likely</h3><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-19-7.jpg\" alt=\"US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg\"><figcaption>Ruth Bader Ginsberg 1933-2020</figcaption></figure></div><p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (RBG) died on Friday. Her death will affect our election and the stock market.<p>I have seen several surveys of voters that asked if the voter will vote in person or mail in his ballot. One recent survey found that 89% of republicans will vote in person, but only 45% of democrats will.<p>If that is even close to accurate, Trump will have a huge majority of popular votes and electoral votes on election night. I assume he will declare that he won the election, fully aware that possibly half of the democrat votes were not yet counted.<p>Over the next couple weeks, as they get counted, Biden might end up leading Trump by millions of votes. Also, he could even have an electoral landslide victory.<p>President Trump has been involved in thousands of lawsuits in his life. Who does not think he and his supporters will sue over the results of the election if he loses? The republicans will claim that many of the mail-in votes were fake and came from China. The democrats will claim that republican secretaries of state and governors unlawfully rejected votes from democratic areas.<h3 id=\"22-scotus-will-be-a-mess\">SCOTUS will be a mess</h3><p>Since everyone knows there will be claims of fraud on both sides and that there will be lawsuits, this should quickly reach the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) and it will be resolved before Christmas.<p>There are now 5 conservatives and only 3 liberals on the court. I am very confident that Chief Justice Roberts, a conservative, and at least one other conservative will do the right thing. They will put the interests of the country ahead of their ideology.<p>I do not think that the Senate will approve a replacement ahead of the election. I say that because the republican Senate in 2016 blocked Obama’s appointment, claiming it should wait until after the election so that the American people could have a say in who the next justice would be.<p>The fairness issue will be a problem for swing voters, especially in the suburbs, who will be key to Trump’s chances of re-election. The republicans know that if they approve the new justice before the election, it will cost them votes. It will increase the chance of democrats taking the Senate and Presidency. The republican senators who are at risk of losing know that the risk will increase if they vote to approve the nominee before the new Senate takes control on January 3. Several will likely be unwilling to take that risk.<p>If there is a vote on Trump’s nominee, I think that at least 4 republicans will go along with the democrats and block the nomination. Three might be the number needed because Arizona said it will seat its new senator on November 30 if the democrat wins.<p>Let’s say the democrats win the Senate and the White House on November 3. What would happen if the republicans approve Trump’s nominee after November 3 but before the democrats take control of the Senate on January 3? The republicans will be giving President-elect Biden a free pass to increase the number of justices to 13 so that the liberals will control the Court. Remember, the Constitution does not specify that there are 9 justices. We just made that up. The president can nominate as many as he wants and the Senate can approve as many as they want.<h3 id=\"23-the-votes-will-get-counted\">The votes will get counted</h3><p>Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, has a strong sense of responsibility and a deep respect for the Constitution. I trust him to do the right thing, and his leadership will decide who the next president will be.<p>The vote should not be a 4 – 4 tie because the country will be turning to the Court for an answer. Their job is to give a clear answer, and I believe they will. I am confident that Roberts will be able to bring one other conservative with him so that there will be at least 5 votes in favor of counting all of the votes. The Court will conclude that there has to be a very strong reason to not count a vote. The result will be that most votes will get counted.<p>That does not mean that Biden will win because no one knows which side will have the better turnout. However, it does mean that the election will be fair and it will be decided before January 20.<p>All of this is great fun for people who enjoy talking politics, but it creates so much negativity that it might be impossible for the stock market to rally much until after the election results are final. Therefore, the Emini will probably be in a trading range through the end of the year.<h2 id=\"24-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Last week was an outside down candlestick on the weekly chart. That reduces the chance of a strong rally this week.<p>There now 3 consecutive bear bars on the weekly chart. That has not happened since the 5 bear bars during the pandemic crash. The most recent time before that was 6 years earlier. This means that there is an increased chance of a bull bar on the weekly chart either this week or next.<p>I have been saying that the bears are trying to make September an outside down month. That would increase the chance of lower prices in October. The overnight low is currently below the August low of 3266.25.<p>Also, I said that if September went outside down, it would likely close the gap above the July high. Remember, there was a rare gap up on the monthly chart in August. The July high is 3261.50, and the Emini’s overnight low is below that high.<p>The bulls are hoping that last week’s bear breakout will fail and that the Emini will soon break above the 2 week trading range. However, I have been saying since late August that the Emini should fall to 3000 – 3200. This is still true, even though there can always be a surprising strong rally for several days before it reaches its target. Traders will sell the 1st 1 – 3 bar rally.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 65 points in the Globex session. If the day session opens here, September will be an outside down month and it will have closed the gap below the August low.<p>But what will happen next? When there is a big gap down on the 5 minute chart, the Emini is far below its average price. I use the 20 bar EMA as a measure of what is average. The bears are willing to sell if the early bars are strongly bearish. If they are not, the bears will look to sell higher.<p>The bulls often see a big gap down as an opportunity to buy for a bounce and possible a bull trend day. If there are early strong bull bars, the bulls will buy.<p>Most often, a big gap leads to a trading range for the 1st hour or two. The bulls will then look to buy a reversal up from a wedge bottom or double bottom. The bears want to sell a wedge rally to the EMA or a double top around the EMA.<p>If there is an early trading range, it is a sign of balance. That reduces the chance of a breakout leading to a trend that will last all day. There might be a 2 – 4 hour trend in either direction, but it typically will get exhausted before the end of the day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bear-trend-and-sell-climax-then-trend-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-21.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend and sell climax then trend reversal up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

I have been saying that a tight trading range is neutral, but because of the wedge buy climax to resistance on the weekly chart, this one has a slightly higher chance of a bear breakout.<p>The bears want a pullback to the June 10 high. That was the breakout point for the July rally and it is about a measured move down. It is therefore a magnet below. The June 19 low was the start of the strong July rally. It, too, is a magnet if the EURUSD starts to work lower.<p>With the Fed saying that it wants to increase inflation, that will result in increased interest rates in the US. Money from around the world will get drawn to the US to get higher returns. If so, those foreign currencies will be converted to dollars. That demand for dollars could be the catalyst for a fall in the EURUSD.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above Friday’s high and reversed down strongly to below Friday’s low. Today is therefore an outside down day.<p>The EURUSD is now testing the bottom of the 8 week tight trading range. This increases the chance of a bear breakout this week and then a move down to at least 1.1422 at the June 10 high.<p>Trading ranges resist breaking out. The bulls will therefore try to stop the overnight collapse. But when a selloff is as strong as this one has been, the best the bulls can usually do is convert the strong bear trend into a trading range.<p>Day traders overnight sold aggressively during the collapse. Although there was some profit taking for a few hours, the bulls took quick profits. Day traders have been selling. It will continue to be better to only sell until the EURUSD enters a trading range.<p>But even if it does, if today closes near the low of the day, it will increase the chance of a successful break below the 8 week trading range and a quick move down for 300 – 500 pips.<p>At some point today, traders will begin to take profits at the low and then only sell again after a 20 – 30 pip bounce. If the bulls get that bounce, they will start to buy reversals up for scalps. However, it will probably be easier all day for sellers than buyers to make money.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-gap-down-and-then-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini gap down and then bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It also gapped below the August low. September is now an outside down month on the monthly chart. Additionally, it closed the rare monthly gap above the July high. I said when it formed that it was probably going to close within a bar (month) or two because small gaps typically soon close.<p>Despite the gap down the weekly chart, the Emini is now at the 20 week EMA and it is oversold on the daily and 60 minute charts. Also, after 3 bear bars on the weekly chart, this week or next week should be a bull bar. Today closed on its high and it is a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Even though the Emini should fall to between 3000 and 3200, it does not have to get there this week.

Last week was an outside down candlestick on the weekly chart. That reduces the chance of a strong rally this week.<p>There now 3 consecutive bear bars on the weekly chart. That has not happened since the 5 bear bars during the pandemic crash. The most recent time before that was 6 years earlier. This means that there is an increased chance of a bull bar on the weekly chart either this week or next.<p>I have been saying that the bears are trying to make September an outside down month. That would increase the chance of lower prices in October. The overnight low is currently below the August low of 3266.25.<p>Also, I said that if September went outside down, it would likely close the gap above the July high. Remember, there was a rare gap up on the monthly chart in August. The July high is 3261.50, and the Emini’s overnight low is below that high.<p>The bulls are hoping that last week’s bear breakout will fail and that the Emini will soon break above the 2 week trading range. However, I have been saying since late August that the Emini should fall to 3000 – 3200. This is still true, even though there can always be a surprising strong rally for several days before it reaches its target. Traders will sell the 1st 1 – 3 bar rally.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 65 points in the Globex session. If the day session opens here, September will be an outside down month and it will have closed the gap below the August low.<p>But what will happen next? When there is a big gap down on the 5 minute chart, the Emini is far below its average price. I use the 20 bar EMA as a measure of what is average. The bears are willing to sell if the early bars are strongly bearish. If they are not, the bears will look to sell higher.<p>The bulls often see a big gap down as an opportunity to buy for a bounce and possible a bull trend day. If there are early strong bull bars, the bulls will buy.<p>Most often, a big gap leads to a trading range for the 1st hour or two. The bulls will then look to buy a reversal up from a wedge bottom or double bottom. The bears want to sell a wedge rally to the EMA or a double top around the EMA.<p>If there is an early trading range, it is a sign of balance. That reduces the chance of a breakout leading to a trend that will last all day. There might be a 2 – 4 hour trend in either direction, but it typically will get exhausted before the end of the day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bear-trend-and-sell-climax-then-trend-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-21.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend and sell climax then trend reversal up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-testing-neckline-of-head-and-shoulders-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-21-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex testing neckline of head and shoulders top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is again testing the neck line of the 4 week head and shoulders top and the bottom of the 8 week trading range. I have been saying that a tight trading range is neutral, but because of the wedge buy climax to resistance on the weekly chart, this one has a slightly higher chance of a bear breakout.<p>The bears want a pullback to the June 10 high. That was the breakout point for the July rally and it is about a measured move down. It is therefore a magnet below. The June 19 low was the start of the strong July rally. It, too, is a magnet if the EURUSD starts to work lower.<p>With the Fed saying that it wants to increase inflation, that will result in increased interest rates in the US. Money from around the world will get drawn to the US to get higher returns. If so, those foreign currencies will be converted to dollars. That demand for dollars could be the catalyst for a fall in the EURUSD.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above Friday’s high and reversed down strongly to below Friday’s low. Today is therefore an outside down day.<p>The EURUSD is now testing the bottom of the 8 week tight trading range. This increases the chance of a bear breakout this week and then a move down to at least 1.1422 at the June 10 high.<p>Trading ranges resist breaking out. The bulls will therefore try to stop the overnight collapse. But when a selloff is as strong as this one has been, the best the bulls can usually do is convert the strong bear trend into a trading range.<p>Day traders overnight sold aggressively during the collapse. Although there was some profit taking for a few hours, the bulls took quick profits. Day traders have been selling. It will continue to be better to only sell until the EURUSD enters a trading range.<p>But even if it does, if today closes near the low of the day, it will increase the chance of a successful break below the 8 week trading range and a quick move down for 300 – 500 pips.<p>At some point today, traders will begin to take profits at the low and then only sell again after a 20 – 30 pip bounce. If the bulls get that bounce, they will start to buy reversals up for scalps. However, it will probably be easier all day for sellers than buyers to make money.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-gap-down-and-then-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini gap down and then bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It also gapped below the August low. September is now an outside down month on the monthly chart. Additionally, it closed the rare monthly gap above the July high. I said when it formed that it was probably going to close within a bar (month) or two because small gaps typically soon close.<p>Despite the gap down the weekly chart, the Emini is now at the 20 week EMA and it is oversold on the daily and 60 minute charts. Also, after 3 bear bars on the weekly chart, this week or next week should be a bull bar. Today closed on its high and it is a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Even though the Emini should fall to between 3000 and 3200, it does not have to get there this week. With it oversold and at support, it might bounce for 1 – 3 days first. This is especially true since the entire 4 week selloff is probably only a minor reversal down on the daily and weekly charts.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It sold off to the 20 week EMA and reversed up. After 3 consecutive bear bars on the weekly chart, a bull bar is likely this week or next week.<p>September is now an outside down bar on the monthly chart. But there are 5 consecutive bull bars on the monthly chart. This reversal will probably be minor. That increases the chance that September will close back above the August low.<p>Yesterday’s reversal up was at 10% down from the high on the cash index, which is support. Yesterday closed on its high and it is therefore a buy signal bar for today on the daily chart.<p>All of these factors are good for the bulls over the next week. However, there was as streak of 9 consecutive bull days in August. The Emini typically falls to below the low of streaks like that. The bottom of the streak was the July 30 low of 3184.75. Consequently, traders will probably sell a 1 – 3 day rally, expecting a test of that low. The odds are that the Emini will reach 3000 – 3200 before it makes a new high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 5 points in the Globex session. Since yesterday was a buy signal bar on the daily chart at support in an oversold market, traders expect today to go above yesterday’s high and trigger the buy signal. A good buy signal bar at support in an oversold market increases the chance of a bull trend day today. It also increases the chance of a rally that could last a few days.<p>Day traders today expect some follow-through buying after yesterday’s late strong rally. Bull trend days usually make an early low of the day. With an increased chance of a bull trend day today, day traders will look to buy an early selloff today.<p>However, there are important targets below on the daily chart. Therefore, any rally might only last 1 – 3 days. There is a small chance that today will go above yesterday’s high and then trend down to below yesterday’s low, which would form an outside down bar.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-gap-down-and-then-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-22.png\" alt=\"Emini gap down and then bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is a 50% chance of a successful breakout and measured move up or down. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout.

Traders would then look for a leg up.<p>There is still room to the August 3 low at the bottom of the range. The lack of a reversal increases the chance that the EURUSD will have to test that low before the bulls can regain control.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke below yesterday’s low and again below the neckline of the 5-week head and shoulders top overnight. However, the bulls bought the breakout.<p>Today so far has been a small trading range day, like most days for several weeks. Day traders continue to look for reversals and 10 – 20 pip scalps.<p>The bears are hoping that today’s trading range will be a bear flag in the yesterday’s selloff. They want the EURUSD to test below the August 3 low.<p>The bulls see the overnight low as a lower low major trend reversal on the 5 minute chart.<p>There is no sign that the overnight range is about to breakout up or down.

When today gapped above yesterday’s high, it triggered the buy signal.<p>On the 5 minute chart, the Emini entered a triangle for the 1st several hours today. The triangle was also a head and shoulders bottom bull flag. There was a bull breakout and a resumption of yesterday’s bull trend.<p>The next target on the daily chart is the 50-day MA at around 3330. The Emini should get there this week, maybe tomorrow.

I said that the Emini was likely to rally for a few days this week and this is the bear rally.<p>However, because of the streak of 9 consecutive bull days on the daily chart, the Emini will still probably trade below the bottom of that streak before making a new high. That low of 3184.75 came on July 30. Consequently, traders are planning to sell this rally, but are waiting for a credible sell signal bar.<p>How much higher can the Emini go? The next target is the 50-day MA at around 3334. That was failed support and it is therefore a now a magnet. The Emini should get there this week and maybe today. The bulls hope that the Emini will break strongly above it, which would be a sign that the bull trend is resuming.<p>If the Emini breaks above the September 16 lower high, the odds that the rally will continue up to a new high will increase to about the same as for a 2nd leg down to 3000 – 3200.<p>September is an outside down bar on the monthly chart. But since the 5 month rally was strong, September will probably close above the August low of 3266.25. Therefore, there is not much downside risk over the remaining 6 trading days in September.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. It might gap above yesterday’s high. If it does, the gap will be small. Small gaps typically close early in the session.<p>Since the 50-day MA was so important for the past couple of weeks when the Emini was above it, it is still important now that the Emini is below it. The Emini should get drawn to it this week. It is currently around 3334.<p>Unless the bulls get several more bull days, this is still probably a bear rally. However, rallies in bear trends can be strong. Consequently, traders should not be surprised if today becomes a strong bull day.<p>However, the 2-day rally has not been especially strong. It is more likely that many bulls will become disappointed. Disappointed bulls tend to take profits and wait for a pullback to buy. Also, bears tend to sell weak rallies. Therefore, there is an increased chance of trading range price action today.<p>As I said, the Emini will probably finish the month above the August low of 3266.25. The Emini might go begin to form a trading range for the remainder of the month between the Augusts low and the 50-day MA.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-High-2-bottom-and-then-wedge-top-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-23.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 bottom and then wedge top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

So far, the breakout has been small and the EURUSD is holding around the bottom of the range.<p>On the monthly chart (not shown), September traded above the August high and then below its low. September is now an outside down month. That is bearish, especially when it comes in a buy climax at resistance. It increases the chance of at least slightly lower prices in October. The outside down candlestick will be more bearish if September closes below the August low.<p>However, most trading range breakouts fail. There were several breakouts above the top of the range that reversed down.<p>Since the bull trend was so strong on the monthly chart, September will probably close back above the August low. That means the EURUSD will probably be above the bottom of the trading range next week when September ends. Therefore, this bear breakout will likely not fall much lower in the next few days. Traders expect that the EURUSD will turn up, at least slightly, within a day or two for the remainder of the month.<p>What happens if today closes far below the August low and tomorrow is also a big bear day? Traders will conclude that the breakout is successful and that the selloff will continue down for a measured move. The 1st downside target is the June 10 high. That was the breakout point for the July bull breakout.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market fell below the bottom of the 8-week trading range overnight. However, the breakout was small and the EURUSD bounced. It has been sideways in a small trading range around the August 3 low for the entire overnight session.<p>The bears want today to close far below the August low and on the low of the day. That is unlikely, given how the breakout has been small and most breakout attempts fail. At a minimum, they want today to close at least 1 pip below the August 3 low. If they then get a 2nd close below the range tomorrow, traders will assume that a successful breakout has begun. The bears will sell rallies today as long as today remains a trading range day, as they try to get the bulls to give up.<p>The bulls always want the opposite. They hope today is a failed breakout. They hope this is the start of a swing up to the top of the range. They will buy reversals up from the August 3 low and try to create a strong buy signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The odds of a reversal up will be greater if today is a bull day closing on its high and with a big body on the daily chart. At a minimum, they want today to close at or above the August low. They would prefer that it closes above the open so that today’s candlestick would have a bull body. That would make it a better buy signal bar for tomorrow. Traders would then be more willing to buy tomorrow above today’s high.<p>What is most likely? Today will probably remain a small trading range day and close a little above or below the August low. However, because the EURUSD is at such an important price, there is an increased chance of a big trend today up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-23-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was therefore an outside down day and it is a sell signal bar for tomorrow on the daily chart.<p>The Emini accelerated down in the middle of the day and fell back below the August low and the open of the week. It closed at 3231.25. I have been saying for a month that a minimum target is 3200. It is a Big Round Number, which is a psychological magnet. The Emini is also near the July 30 bottom of a 9 day bull streak, the close of last year, and the June 5 high breakout point.<p>Because today’s selloff was so extreme, tomorrow will probably have at least a could hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour. The Emini could even bounce for a few days. However, traders still think it will trade down to 3000 – 3200 before the bulls can make a new high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday was the 3rd day up and traders sold the Emini aggressively all day.<p>The Emini formed a big bear outside down bar yesterday. It fell below the August low and tested the low of the week. The cash index is again down about 10%, which is the start of correction territory. The Emini is just above the top of the 3000 – 3200 target range and it might get there this week.<p>The magnets around 3200 are the Big Round Number, the close of 2019, a 10% correction, the June 5 high, and the July 30 bottom of the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart. The June 29 low of 2978.25 was the start of a tight bull channel. On the weekly chart, the 20 week EMA is just above 3200. It is therefore another important magnet below, and it is the reason why I have been saying that this selloff could fall to below 3000 before the bulls get a swing up.<p>The US election is going to be a mess and a huge distraction. This will make it difficult for the bulls to get a new high until the politics get resolved. Therefore, the September high might remain the high for the rest of the year.<p>There are still 5 trading days remaining in September. While the Emini has formed an outside down month on the monthly chart, the bulls will try to have September close above the August low. That would be less bearish going into October.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 25 points in the Globex session. It is just above the cluster of support at around 3000.<p>After a sell climax day like yesterday, there is only a 25% chance of a 2nd strong bear trend day. If the Emini continues down today, it will probably be in a weaker bear trend, like a trending trading range day. That is a day with an early trading range, a brief bear breakout, and then a lower trading range.<p>When a day ends in a strong sell climax, there is a 75% chance that the Emini will have at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. There is a 50% chance of some follow-through selling on the open before the trading range begins.<p>Can today be a big bull day? A tight bear channel typically will not reverse up into a bull trend without first transitioning into a trading range. Therefore, if there is a strong rally on the open, it will probably be minor. The bulls will probably need to stop the selling, enter a trading range, and then form a major trend reversal pattern. This would take at least a couple hours.<p>Also, after a huge bear trend day like yesterday, a bull day today would probably be unable to reverse all of yesterday’s selling. The best the bulls can probably get today is either a trading range day or a weak bull trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-24.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today is 2 days after the breakout and it is the follow-through day. It is therefore important. A 2nd consecutive bear bar closing below the bottom of the range will make it likely that the selloff will fall for about a measured move down. That would be below the June 10 high. That was the breakout point of the strong July rally.<p>The bears need a bear body today, which means a close below the open. The bigger the bear body and the more it closes on its low, the stronger the follow-through selling. That will increase the chance of the selloff continuing for about a measured move down.<p>The bulls want the bear breakout to fail. At a minimum, they do not want today to be a bear day closing near its low. They would prefer today to close above its midpoint. If possible, they will try to get today to close on its high and have a big bull body. If they get that, traders will look for a reversal up from a failed breakout.<p>With the overnight range being small, today will probably not be a big day up or down. The fight today will be over whether there will be a bull or bear body. Unless the bulls get a strong reversal up, traders will expect at least slightly lower prices in October.<h3>Outside down candlestick on the monthly chart</h3><p>This month is an outside down month on the monthly chart (not shown). Since there are 4 consecutive bull bars on the monthly chart, the bulls have been strong. They will try to get September to close next Wednesday above the August low, which is the bottom of the 8-week trading range.<p>On the 60 minute chart, this selloff began with a spike down on September 21. It has been in a bear channel since then. A Spike and Channel bear trend usually evolves into a trading range. The bulls typically get a break above the bear trend line and then a rally up to the start of the bear channel or at least up to a major lower high in the channel.<p>The bear channel began with Monday’s lower high of 1.1774. With 5 trading days left in September, there is enough time for the EURUSD to get there by the end of the month.<p>At the moment, this is likely to happen. Why is that important? Because it is back above the bottom of the 8-week trading range, which means back above the August low.<p>If September closes above the August low, it would be less bearish going into August. It would increase the chance that the selloff is just a pullback from the very strong 5-month rally instead of the start of a bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market is continuing down in its 3-day bear channel. There is no sign of a reversal. Day traders are continuing to sell rallies, betting that each will form a lower high and lead to a new low.<p>The 3-day bear channel on the 5-minute chart has had many bear rallies of 20 – 30 pips. This is big enough for bulls to buy reversals up for 10-pip scalps. However, it is still easier for day traders to make money selling reversals down from those rallies.<p>The fight today is over the close. Will today close near its low, making lower prices likely tomorrow? Or, will the bulls get a bull body on the daily chart? That will increase the chance that a reversal up to the start of the 3-day bear channel has begun. Until there is a strong reversal up, traders will continue to bet on lower prices.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-spike-and-channel-bull-trend-at-3200.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bull trend at 3200\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Support and resistance are magnets. They draw the market to them. The Emini dipped below 3200 and rallied strongly in a Spike and Channel Bull Trend today to above the resistance of the open of the week and the August low. It then evolved into a trading range, which is what typically happens when there is a Spike and Channel trend.<p>Today is a buy signal bar for tomorrow on the daily chart, but it has a big tail on top and the Emini is in a bear swing. This is a weak buy setup.<p>However, the bulls will try to get tomorrow to close above the open of the week. This week would then have a bull body. The past 3 bars on the weekly chart had bear bodies and 4 consecutive bear bars on the is unusual. Therefore, traders should expect an attempt by the bulls to get the Emini back up there tomorrow.<p>Also, next Wednesday is the final day in September. The close of the month will probably be above the August low. This is because September is an outside down month in a strong bull trend. The close of the bar is usually above the low of the prior bar.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday was the 3rd day up and traders sold the Emini aggressively all day.<p>The Emini formed a big bear outside down bar yesterday. It fell below the August low and tested the low of the week. The cash index is again down about 10%, which is the start of correction territory. The Emini is just above the top of the 3000 – 3200 target range and it might get there this week.<p>The magnets around 3200 are the Big Round Number, the close of 2019, a 10% correction, the June 5 high, and the July 30 bottom of the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart. The June 29 low of 2978.25 was the start of a tight bull channel. On the weekly chart, the 20 week EMA is just above 3200. It is therefore another important magnet below, and it is the reason why I have been saying that this selloff could fall to below 3000 before the bulls get a swing up.<p>The US election is going to be a mess and a huge distraction. This will make it difficult for the bulls to get a new high until the politics get resolved. Therefore, the September high might remain the high for the rest of the year.<p>There are still 5 trading days remaining in September. While the Emini has formed an outside down month on the monthly chart, the bulls will try to have September close above the August low. That would be less bearish going into October.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 25 points in the Globex session. It is just above the cluster of support at around 3000.<p>After a sell climax day like yesterday, there is only a 25% chance of a 2nd strong bear trend day. If the Emini continues down today, it will probably be in a weaker bear trend, like a trending trading range day. That is a day with an early trading range, a brief bear breakout, and then a lower trading range.<p>When a day ends in a strong sell climax, there is a 75% chance that the Emini will have at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. There is a 50% chance of some follow-through selling on the open before the trading range begins.<p>Can today be a big bull day? A tight bear channel typically will not reverse up into a bull trend without first transitioning into a trading range. Therefore, if there is a strong rally on the open, it will probably be minor. The bulls will probably need to stop the selling, enter a trading range, and then form a major trend reversal pattern. This would take at least a couple hours.<p>Also, after a huge bear trend day like yesterday, a bull day today would probably be unable to reverse all of yesterday’s selling. The best the bulls can probably get today is either a trading range day or a weak bull trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-24.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Support and resistance are magnets that draw the market to them. Yesterday dipped below 3200 and then rallied strongly back to the resistance of the open of the week and the August low.<p>Remember, I have been saying that September will probably close above the August low. This is because September is an outside down month on the monthly chart in a strong bull trend. The close of an outside bar is usually above the low of the prior month when the bull trend is strong. The Emini might oscillate around that low over the final 4 trading days in September, but it should be above it when the month ends on Wednesday.<p>I have also been saying that this week should have a bull body on the weekly chart. This is because 4 consecutive bear bars on the weekly chart is rare. The past 3 weeks had bear bodies so this week or next week should have a bull body. The bulls will try to have this week close above the open of the week. With these 2 magnets around yesterday’s high, the Emini might get drawn back up there by the end of the day today.<p>Yesterday was a weak buy signal bar on the daily chart at support. Therefore, the Emini could rally for a few days. However, there is still a 50% chance of it falling to around 3000 over the next few weeks. That is the bottom of the June trading range, which is a potential Final Bull Flag and a magnet below. Also, the 3000 Big Round Number is a psychological magnet.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 13 points in the Globex session. With the magnets of the open of the week and last week’s low up near yesterday’s high, the bulls will try to get back up there at some point today. They will therefore look for a reversal up from a double bottom with one of yesterday’s lows.<p>The bears want lower prices next week. The chance of that will go up if today closes near the low of the day. It would then close below the 20-week EMA and near the magnet of the 100-day MA.<p>What is most likely? Yesterday had several big reversals. That means there is confusion. Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range. Consequently, there is an increased chance that today will continue yesterday’s trading range price action.<p>Because today is Friday, day traders will look for a move late in the day to weekly support and resistance. There are many reasons for support around yesterday’s low and 3200. The bears want the week to close below that support. There is resistance around yesterday’s high. At a minimum, the bulls want the week to close above last week’s low.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-spike-and-channel-bull-trend-at-3200.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-25.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bull trend at 3200\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday was the follow-through bar. It was a 2nd consecutive close below the trading range, which increases the chance of a measured move down to below the June 10 high. That high is the breakout point and therefore a magnet below.<p>But yesterday had a bull body. Even though it was tiny, it was a sign of hesitation. It reduces the chance that the selloff will be a trend reversal instead of just a deep pullback in a strong bull trend.<p>Today so far is a bear bar on the daily chart and it is testing yesterday’s low. The bears want today to close below yesterday’s low and at the low of the week. But if the bulls get a reversal up today, there would be a micro double bottom on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of a 1 – 3-day bounce next week.<p>It is unlikely that the selloff will go straight down to below the June 10 high. There will probably be attempts to reverse the trend back up. But unless the bulls get some big bull bars and a couple consecutive closes back above the August 3 bottom of the range, traders will sell rallies, expecting lower prices.<p>Today is Friday and therefore the appearance of the bar on the weekly chart is important. At the moment, this week (not shown) is a big bear bar closing on its low and far below the 8-week tight trading range. If it remains this way, it will increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from 2 pips below yesterday’s high overnight. The low so far is just above yesterday’s low. Today is so far an inside bar on the daily chart.<p>The bears want today to stay at the low of the session. This week would then be a big bear bar on the weekly chart with a close near its low. Traders would expect follow-through selling next week.<p>The bulls want a reversal back up to the high of the day. Today would then be a micro double bottom with yesterday on the daily chart, which would increase the chance of a bounce next week.<p>The overnight selloff has been in a tight bear channel so day traders have only been selling. However, the selling is stalling at yesterday’s low. If the bulls can get a 20 – 30 pip bounce, day traders will begin to buy. They would expect either a trading range or a bull trend reversal.<p>For the bulls to get a reversal up, they will probably need the selloff to transition into a trading range for at least an hour. Usually a bear trend needs to go sideways and form at least a small double bottom before it can reverse into a bull trend.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Support and resistance are magnets that draw the market to them. Yesterday dipped below 3200 and then rallied strongly back to the resistance of the open of the week and the August low.<p>Remember, I have been saying that September will probably close above the August low. This is because September is an outside down month on the monthly chart in a strong bull trend. The close of an outside bar is usually above the low of the prior month when the bull trend is strong. The Emini might oscillate around that low over the final 4 trading days in September, but it should be above it when the month ends on Wednesday.<p>I have also been saying that this week should have a bull body on the weekly chart. This is because 4 consecutive bear bars on the weekly chart is rare. The past 3 weeks had bear bodies so this week or next week should have a bull body. The bulls will try to have this week close above the open of the week. With these 2 magnets around yesterday’s high, the Emini might get drawn back up there by the end of the day today.<p>Yesterday was a weak buy signal bar on the daily chart at support. Therefore, the Emini could rally for a few days. However, there is still a 50% chance of it falling to around 3000 over the next few weeks. That is the bottom of the June trading range, which is a potential Final Bull Flag and a magnet below. Also, the 3000 Big Round Number is a psychological magnet.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 13 points in the Globex session. With the magnets of the open of the week and last week’s low up near yesterday’s high, the bulls will try to get back up there at some point today. They will therefore look for a reversal up from a double bottom with one of yesterday’s lows.<p>The bears want lower prices next week. The chance of that will go up if today closes near the low of the day. It would then close below the 20-week EMA and near the magnet of the 100-day MA.<p>What is most likely? Yesterday had several big reversals. That means there is confusion. Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range. Consequently, there is an increased chance that today will continue yesterday’s trading range price action.<p>Because today is Friday, day traders will look for a move late in the day to weekly support and resistance. There are many reasons for support around yesterday’s low and 3200. The bears want the week to close below that support. There is resistance around yesterday’s high. At a minimum, the bulls want the week to close above last week’s low.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-spike-and-channel-bull-trend-at-3200.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-25.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bull trend at 3200\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars.

Yesterday was the follow-through bar. It was a 2nd consecutive close below the trading range, which increases the chance of a measured move down to below the June 10 high. That high is the breakout point and therefore a magnet below.<p>But yesterday had a bull body. Even though it was tiny, it was a sign of hesitation. It reduces the chance that the selloff will be a trend reversal instead of just a deep pullback in a strong bull trend.<p>Today so far is a bear bar on the daily chart and it is testing yesterday’s low. The bears want today to close below yesterday’s low and at the low of the week. But if the bulls get a reversal up today, there would be a micro double bottom on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of a 1 – 3-day bounce next week.<p>It is unlikely that the selloff will go straight down to below the June 10 high. There will probably be attempts to reverse the trend back up. But unless the bulls get some big bull bars and a couple consecutive closes back above the August 3 bottom of the range, traders will sell rallies, expecting lower prices.<p>Today is Friday and therefore the appearance of the bar on the weekly chart is important. At the moment, this week (not shown) is a big bear bar closing on its low and far below the 8-week tight trading range. If it remains this way, it will increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from 2 pips below yesterday’s high overnight. The low so far is just above yesterday’s low. Today is so far an inside bar on the daily chart.<p>The bears want today to stay at the low of the session. This week would then be a big bear bar on the weekly chart with a close near its low. Traders would expect follow-through selling next week.<p>The bulls want a reversal back up to the high of the day. Today would then be a micro double bottom with yesterday on the daily chart, which would increase the chance of a bounce next week.<p>The overnight selloff has been in a tight bear channel so day traders have only been selling. However, the selling is stalling at yesterday’s low. If the bulls can get a 20 – 30 pip bounce, day traders will begin to buy. They would expect either a trading range or a bull trend reversal.<p>For the bulls to get a reversal up, they will probably need the selloff to transition into a trading range for at least an hour. Usually a bear trend needs to go sideways and form at least a small double bottom before it can reverse into a bull trend.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After September became an Emini outside down month in a strong bull trend, traders expect September to close above the August low.<p>The<strong>Bond futures</strong>market is in a tight trading range on the daily chart. It is in Breakout Mode. Traders at this point should wait for a breakout up or down.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is reversing down strongly from a wedge top on the weekly chart.

An inside bar after an outside bar is an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. Traders believe that the chance of a bull breakout is the same as for a bear breakout.<p>There are still 3 trading days left in the month. While it is possible for September to go above or below the August range by the end of the month, it is not likely.<p>A Breakout Mode pattern always has both a bull and bear setup. The bulls see the trading range as a bull flag in a strong bull trend. For the bears, they see March as the end of the most extreme buy climax in history. They expect the reversal to resume down to the start of the final buy climax, which was the January low.<h2 id=\"3-bond-futures-weekly-chart-has-a-triangle\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart has a triangle</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-triangle-apex.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-26-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in triangle apex\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures market has been in a tight trading range for 6 weeks. It has been in a triangle for 8 weeks.<p>The range of the bars over the past 3 weeks was small. This is a Breakout Mode pattern, like on the monthly chart. There is an equal chance of a successful breakout up or down. Also, as with any Breakout Mode pattern, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout will fail.<p>For the bulls, they see the past 8 weeks as a pullback from the June rally. For the bears, they see a double top bear flag with the April and August highs. Traders need a clear strong breakout of the range to see which side was right.<h2 id=\"4-bond-futures-daily-chart-has-a-diamond-pattern\">Bond futures<strong><em>daily</em></strong>chart has a diamond pattern</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bond-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-in-diamond-pattern-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-26-2.png\" alt=\"Bond futures daily candlestick chart in diamond pattern breakout mode\"></a></figure><p>The daily bond futures chart has had a tight trading range for most of September. Like the weekly and monthly charts, this is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Most traders are waiting for the breakout. If there is a big breakout that has 2 or more strong trend bars, it will probably continue for at least a couple weeks. If it reverses within a few bars (days), either the bond futures will go sideways again in the tight trading range or the reversal will lead to a breakout in the opposite direction.<p>Most traders do not trade when the market is in a tight range. This is because the reward is small relative to the risk, and it requires many quick trades with little profit. A lot of work without much profit. They trade elsewhere while they wait.<p>The chart is in a diamond pattern. The expanding triangle ended with the August 28 low and the contracting triangle began with the September 3 high.<h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"6-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-an-outside-down-bar-and-a-double-top\">EURUSD<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart has an outside down bar and a double top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-double-top-but-minor-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-26-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart double top but minor trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex monthly chart in September traded above the August high and then below the August low. September is therefore an outside down month. Since it is at the resistance of the September 2018 high, this is a bearish pattern. There is now a double top. The outside down bar increases the chance of at least slightly lower prices in October.<p>It is important to note that the rally had 4 strong bull bars. The 1st reversal down from a strong rally is typically minor. It could last a bar (month) or two and dip below the March high breakout point, but traders will look to buy the pullback.<p>When there is an outside down bar in a strong bull trend, the close of the outside down bar is usually around or above the low of the prior month. Consequently, the bulls will buy into the end of the month as they try to get September to close above the August low. That would reduce the bearishness going into October.<h2 id=\"7-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-turning-down-from-a-wedge-top\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart is turning down from a wedge top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-reversing-down-from-wedge-buy-climax-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-26-4.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in triangle apex\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart broke below the 2 month trading range this week. Additionally, it closed below last week’s low. That increases the chance that there will be lower prices over the next few weeks.<p>The odds will be higher if next week is a 2nd consecutive bear bar closing on its low. However, since September will probably close around the August low, traders should expect next week to disappoint the bears. If it is a bull reversal bar, traders will conclude that the bear breakout is failing.<p>What is most likely in the final 3 trading days in September? The EURUSD will probably drift up to the August low and the month will then close a little above or below that low. Traders should expect confusion caused by a follow-through bar that is not clearly bullish or bearish. The breakout below the 8-week range is good for the bears, but the 4-month rally is good for the bulls.<p>I have been saying for 2 months that the wedge top at the resistance of the September 2018 high should lead to a couple legs down. Also, I said that the pullback should dip below the breakout points, which are the June 10 high of 1.1422 and the March 9 high of 1.1496. Since a pullback in a bull trend is usually not a strong selloff, the test down could continue for several more weeks.<p>The reversal down might continue down to the June 26 start of the final leg up. However, traders still expect to buy this pullback, even if it reaches that June 26 low.<p>If the bears get 2 or 3 consecutive big bear bars closing on their lows, traders will begin to wonder if the reversal down is a new bear trend and not just a pullback in a strong bull trend.<h2 id=\"8-eurusd-daily-chart-is-breaking-below-an-8-week-trading-range\">EURUSD<strong><em>daily</em></strong>chart is breaking below an 8-week trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-breaking-below-8-week-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-26-5.png\" alt=\"Bond futures daily candlestick chart breaking below 8 week wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD daily chart finally broke below the bottom of the 8-week trading range on Wednesday. Thursday was the follow-through bar, but it had a small bull body.<p>While this seems unimportant, it is not. Even a tiny bull body is a reminder that the breakout is not as strong as it could have been. It reduces the chance that the selloff is the start of a bear trend and increases the chance that it is going to be just a pullback in this summer’s bull trend.<p>Can the breakout fail next week? While it is possible, the wedge top on the weekly chart should lead to a couple legs down on that chart. This is currently the 1st leg. This is true even though there have been 2 legs on the daily chart.<p>Also, breakout points are magnets. This selloff will probably have to test below the June 10 high before bulls will be eager to buy. Until then, rallies might last a few days, but traders will expect at least one more leg down.<p>What happens if there are a couple big bull bars closing on their highs and back above the September 10 lower high? Traders would conclude that the bull trend is resuming, possibly up to the February 2018 high.<p>Right now, it is more likely that the EURUSD will work lower over the next couple weeks to at least 1.14. Traders will look to sell 2 – 5 day bounces.<h2 id=\"9-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"10-monthly-emini-chart-formed-an-outside-down-bar-in-september-at-resistance\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart formed an outside down bar in September at resistance</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SP500-Emini-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-outside-down-bar-after-expanding-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-26-6.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini futures monthly candlestick chart has outside down bar after expanding triangle\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart in September traded above the August high and then below the August low. It is therefore an outside down candlestick. Since it formed at the resistance of the top of a 3 year expanding triangle, it is a sell signal bar.<p>At the end of August, I wrote that this was a possibility because there was a buy climax at the resistance of the top of the expanding triangle. Also, the past 4 breakouts of the 3-year trading range soon reversed. These reversals created the expanding triangle.<p>There are 3 trading days remaining in September. When there is an outside down bar in a strong bull trend, the close of the bar tends to be around the low of the prior month. Consequently, the August low will be a magnet for the remainder of September.<p>More likely than not, September will close above the August low. That would make the candlestick less bearish. However, September will still probably be a bear bar at resistance and closing below its midpoint. That makes it a sell signal bar for October, and traders will expect at least slightly lower prices next month.<h3 id=\"11-lower-prices-are-likely\">Lower prices are likely</h3><p>How low? The pullback will probably last a bar (month) or two more. It could retrace half of the 5 month rally. If it did, the Emini would fall to around 2867.75, or approximately 2850.<p>Less likely, the Emini could work off the buy climax by going mostly sideways for a couple months. I have been saying for a month that the odds were that it would fall to 3000 – 3200. It dipped below 3200 this month. It probably will go at least a little lower.<p>One final thought. Since the extreme buy climax in late 2017, I have been saying that the Emini would probably be sideways for a decade. The top of the range will probably be below 4000 and the bottom of the range might be the March low, but I think it will be lower. This is because decade-long trading ranges typically have at least one 50% correction. Since the top of the range so far is around 3600, a 50% pullback would be around 1800, which is below the March low and the 2000 Big Round Number.<h2 id=\"12-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-a-weak-high-2-buy-setup\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a weak High 2 buy setup</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SP500-Emini-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-High-2-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar-at-EMA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-26-7.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini futures weekly candlestick chart has weak High 2 bull flag buy signal bar at EMA\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had 3 consecutive bear bars coming into this past week. That is rare. There has only been one streak of 4 or more bear bars since 2012. That was during the pandemic collapse earlier this year. This is the reason why I said last week that this week would probably close above the open of the week and have a bull body, which it did.<p>This week is a buy signal bar for next week. It is the 2nd attempt in the past 3 weeks to resume the 5 month bull trend. That makes it a High 2 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>But after 3 consecutive bear bars, there will probably be sellers not far above this week’s high. Therefore, if the bulls can trigger the buy signal, it will probably just lead to a 1 – 2-week bounce. Traders will continue to expect at least slightly lower prices.<h3 id=\"13-targets-for-the-bears\">Targets for the bears</h3><p>The Emini bears have already achieved one goal. They wanted a pullback below the breakout point of the June 5 high. Thursday reversed up from just below that high.<p>On the weekly chart, there was a trading range in June. A trading range late in a rally is often the Final Bull Flag.<p>While the rally continued up far above that range, it still could be a magnet. The July/August rally was a bull micro channel, and 8 of the 9 bars had bull bodies. That is unsustainable and climactic.<p>When there is a reversal down from a buy climax, the bottom of the final leg up is a magnet. That means the Emini might fall to that June 15 low of 2942.<p>That is just above the 50% correction level of 2867.75. A 50% correction is a common target for a pullback in a bull trend.<h2 id=\"14-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-a-minor-wedge-bottom-at-support\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a minor wedge bottom at support</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SP500-Emini-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-26-8.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini futures daily candlestick chart has wedge bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart tested several support targets this week and reversed up from a wedge bottom. I have been saying that the minimum target for the selloff was the 3200 Big Round Number, which the Emini reached on Thursday.<p>Another magnet around that level was the June 5 high of 3210.50. That was the breakout point for the strong July rally. Pullbacks typically test breakout points. That is why I said it was likely that the Emini would test below that high, which it did this week.<p>Also, this week’s low was just below 3219, which is a 10% drop from the high. When the Emini is at least 10% down, traders use the term “correction” instead of “pullback.”<p>Additionally, the Emini fell one point below the close of 2019. That means it briefly gave back all of the gains of 2020.<p>Different computers buy at different support levels. When there is a cluster of support, more computers buy. That increases the chance of a bounce.<h3 id=\"15-can-the-selloff-become-a-bear-trend\">Can the selloff become a bear trend?</h3><p>Can the Emini continue down sharply to my lower targets? Remember, I have been saying for a month that it would fall below the July 30 low of 3184.75. That was the low of a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars. The Emini typically falls below the bottom of extreme streaks. Consequently, the Emini should get there within a couple weeks.<p>The next targets are the bottom of the June trading range, just below the 3000 Big Round Number, and then a 50% correction down to 2867.75. At the moment, there is a 50% chance that the selloff will reach 3000 and a 40% chance it will fall to the 50% retracement level.<p>Can it continue down to the March low? There is currently only a 30% chance of that happening before there is a test back up to the September high.<h3 id=\"16-a-10-correction-usually-leads-to-lower-prices\">A 10% correction usually leads to lower prices</h3><p>It is important to note that the Emini fell 10% from the high this week. I have talked about the implications of a 10% correction several times before. A 10% selloff means the market is in a correction and not just a pullback. It usually leads to a bigger correction, and the average is about 20%. A 20% selloff is a bear market. The 20% average is skewed by big drops like the 89% Crash in 1929 and the 70% drop during the 2009 financial crisis. However, the point remains that a 10% correction is usually not the end of a move down.<p>This is consistent with what I wrote above. At a minimum, the Emini should drop below the bottom of the streak of 9 consecutive bull days that began in late July. There is currently a 40% chance of a move down to below 3000, which would be about a 20% correction.<p><a aria-label=\"Goldman Sachs reported that since World War II, the average was 13% (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/26/the-stock-market-loses-13percent-in-a-correction-on-average-if-it-doesnt-turn-into-a-bear-market.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Goldman Sachs reported that since World War II, the average was 13%</a>and it took an average of 4 months to make a new high. But once it falls 20%, it is in a bear market. The average drop is 30% and lasts 13 months. On average, the reversal back up needs nearly 22 months to make a new high.<h3 id=\"17-the-emini-should-bounce-next-week\">The Emini should bounce next week</h3><p>The selloff was a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. There was a 2 day spike down in early September. Thursday was the 3rd leg down in the wedge bear channel that followed the spike. A wedge often leads to a couple legs up. That increases the chance of a bounce next week.<p>It is important to note that Wednesday is the final day of the month. I wrote above that the monthly chart should close around and probably above the August low of 3288.25. There is therefore a magnet there, in addition to the support below. Consequently, traders should expect sideways to up trading through Wednesday, with Wednesday probably closing above the August low.<h2 id=\"18-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

When Friday went above Thursday’s high, it triggered a minor wedge bottom buy signal. The rally should last a few days.<p>Last week is a High 2 buy signal bar on the weekly chart at the 20 week EMA. Today will probably go above last week’s high and trigger the buy signal.<p>There is currently a 40% chance that this week was the end of the 4-week pullback. However, it is more likely that the Emini will fall below last week’s low before there will be a new high. With a likely tumultuous election, there might not be another new high this year.<p>September ends on Wednesday. I have been saying for the past week that September should close above the August low because the monthly chart had 5 big bull bars. An outside down bar in a strong bull trend usually closes above the low of the prior bar. This reduces the chance of a big selloff early this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini will probably have a big gap up open today to above last week’s high. Because of the wedge bottom on the daily chart, the rally should reach to around the September 16 lower high this week at around 3400. Day traders will therefore be more inclined to buy.<p>But when there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the EMA. The bulls do not want to pay far above the average price unless the early bars are far above average. That increases the chance of an early trading range. If there is a trading range open, the bulls will look to buy either a wedge pullback or a double bottom around the EMA. Also, the bears will sell a wedge rally or a double top in the 1st couple hours, expecting a test down to the EMA.<p>Can today reverse down on the open and form a big bear trend from the open, like Wednesday? Probably not. This is true even though today will open around the resistance of the 20-day EMA. Today’s gap up is is a 2nd reversal up from a cluster of support at 3200. The odds favor sideways to up trading for at least a couple days.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-28.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a><figcaption>Emini small pullback bull trend</figcaption></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

The bulls hope that the 4-week selloff was just a 2-legged pullback in a 4-month bull trend. If today closes near its high, it will be a buy signal bar for a High 2 bull flag on the daily chart.<p>The bears know that there is typically a pullback to the breakout point. They therefore expect a test of the August 3 low and the September 17 low. That would also be a test of the 20 day EMA.<p>They hope that the rally will fail there and form a lower high. They want what they see as a bear trend to continue down for a measured move and a test of the June 10 high. That high was the breakout point for the July rally.<p>What is likely this week? The EURUSD will probably rally for at least a few days to the resistance to between 1.18 to 1.19. Then traders will decide if the 4-month bull trend will resume or if the correction will continue down to the June 10 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly overnight to near Friday’s high. The goal for the bulls today is to have the day close near today’s high. The more it does, the more likely the EURUSD will rally to around 1.18 this week. Therefore, the bulls will buy pullbacks today.<p>They would like this week to be a bull bar closing near its high on the weekly chart. Traders will then look at last week’s big bear bar as a possible bear trap and failed breakout.<p>The bears want today to close down in the middle or bottom of the day’s range. Today would then be a weaker buy signal bar for tomorrow. A reversal up would then be more likely to fail within 2 – 3 days at around the September 17 high.<p>Day traders have only been buying overnight because of the strong bull trend. But the overnight rally has had 3 legs up and it is near the resistance of Friday’s high. Therefore the bulls will start to take profits. If there is a 20-pip pullback, bear day traders will begin to sell for 10-pip scalps. Until there, it will continue to be easier to make money as a bull today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-28-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It also triggered a wedge bull flag buy signal on the daily chart.<p>However, it was a bull trending trading range day. It oscillated around the resistance of the 20 day EMA and 50 day MA on the daily chart. Traders are deciding if it will turn down from that resistance. More likely, it will continue up to around 3400, which was the start of the small wedge bear channel on the daily chart. But it might go sideways for another day or two as traders make up their minds.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It also triggered a wedge bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. Yesterday closed back above the 50-day MA. Traders expect the Emini to test the lower high just above 3400.<p>However, yesterday was a trending trading range day on the 5 minute chart at both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. It might go sideways for another day or two before traders decide if the rally will continue up to 3400 or form a lower high. At the moment, traders expect at least slightly higher prices.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 4 points in the Globex session. With yesterday being mostly sideways, daytraders expect a lot of trading range price action again today.<p>Even though the 3-day rally should work its way up to the September 16 lower high at around 3400, there will probably be a 1 – 2-day pullback starting this week. The 3-day rally has not had much of a pullback on the 5 minute chart. The Emini is therefore short-term overbought. That increases the chance of a 1 or 2-day pullback this week. But it might wait until after tonight’s debate.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-29.png\" alt=\"emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But, it has turned up for a couple days. Traders are deciding if the 2-day rally is just a test of the bottom of the range, or a resumption of the bull trend.<p>After several consecutive closes below the range, it is slightly more likely that the breakout will have at least one more leg down. However, if the bulls get a couple closes above the September 9 low and the EMA, the EURUSD will probably be back in the range. Traders will expect a continuation of the range. However, if the bulls get one or two closes above the September 10 lower high, traders will conclude that the bull trend is resuming.<p>I mentioned last week that the breakout was weak. When a breakout is weak, there is typically a bounce back to the breakout point, which is happening now. This current bounce should continue up to the 20-day EMA and to the September 9 low within a week. Traders will probably buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback on the way up to the target.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied in a weak bull channel overnight. Traders expect the 2-day rally to reach to above the September 9 low of 1.1753 within a few days.<p>They will buy the 1st 1 – 2-day pullback. Consequently, day traders are more eager to buy pullbacks than sell rallies. But they will sell rallies for scalps once there has been at least one 20-pip pullback.<p>Since most days over the past 2 months have had small ranges and there has been a lack of sustained trends, daytraders are mostly scalping. If there is a 30 to 50-pip breakout up or down, they will swing trade. But they know scalps are much more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-weak-trend-reversal-up-into-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then weak trend reversal up into trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Many bulls would like to see the pullback reach that support and then reverse up before buying for a 2 – 3 day bounce.<p>Because of the uncertainty surrounding tonight’s debate, traders should be open to anything tomorrow. However, on the daily chart, it looks like the pullback should end in a day or two, and then the Emini should continue up to around 3400.<p>But, even if it does, traders expect the Emini to fall below the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended in early August.

It normally would have at least a small 2nd leg up. However, with the insanity of last night’s presidential debate, the swing down might resume today. The country might be so distracted and angry that they might not be willing to buy right now, at least at the current price. We’ll find out today.<p>If today is not a huge bear day, the bulls will probably get at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. But if today is a huge bear day, the 3-day rally might be forming just another lower high in the 4-week bear trend.<p>I said yesterday that the pullback did not reach the 60-minute EMA. I further said that it might have to get down there before the bulls can get a 2nd leg up to the September 16 lower high.<p>Whether or not the rally continues up to above 3400, traders should expect the Emini to fall below the July 30 low at the bottom of that streak of 9 consecutive bull bars in early August. Consequently, the upside from here should be small, and the rally will likely end within a week or so, if it did not already end with the debate.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down only 3 points in the Globex market after selling off strongly from last night’s debate. So far, the technical factors are more important than the debate. As I said above, traders expect a 2-legged rally up to the top of the small wedge on the daily chart. As long as today is not a big bear day, that is still what is most likely.<p>Most of the trading over the past 2 days has been sideways. Since the Emini should work up to above 3400 over the next week, day traders will be looking to buy selloffs, hoping for a resumption of Monday’s rally.<p>Even if today is a 3rd consecutive sideways day, the daily ranges have been big. Therefore, day traders would expect at least one or two swing trades, even if today is a 3rd trading range day.<p>Can today be a huge bull or bear trend day? Any day can be. If there is a strong trend, up is more likely because the reversal up from the wedge bottom has not lasted as long as it should after a 3-week wedge. Also, it has not yet reached the start of the wedge, which traders expect it to do.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-weak-trend-reversal-up-into-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-30.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then weak trend reversal up into trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This week pulled back to the breakout point at the bottom of an 8-week trading range.<p>Traders are deciding if the bear trend will continue down to support below. Unless the bulls get a couple closes above the September 17 low and the EMA, traders will expect the EURUSD to fall for about a measured move.<p>Furthermore, the July rally broke strongly above the March 9 and June 10 highs. Those were the breakout points at the top of a yearlong trading range. The EURUSD might now be working down to test those breakout points, which are about a measured move down.<h3>The bears need follow-through selling on the weekly chart</h3><p>The weekly chart is more important at the moment. Last week was a big bear bar closing on its low. It was a strong reversal down from a wedge rally to resistance.<p>This week is the follow-through bar. If it has a bear body, traders will see this week as confirmation of the reversal down. That will increase the chance of lower prices.<p>But if this week has a bull body, traders will wonder if last week’s bear breakout will fail. This is especially true if this week closes on its high.<p>If this week has a small bull body, traders will expect at least slightly lower prices, but they will see the selloff as just a pullback to the breakout points in the 5 month bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly yesterday to just above the September 17 low and the EMA. However, so far, today sold off from that resistance. Today is currently a bear body on the daily chart.<p>If today closes near its low, today will be a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a Low 1 bear flag. It would increase the chance of lower prices. However, the bears really need the week to close below the open. Then, this week would have a bear body on the weekly chart. That would confirm last week’s bear breakout and increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>Even though the EURUSD has trended down overnight, the selloff has not been strong. Day traders have been making money buying reversals up as well as selling small rallies.<p>The key today will be the close. If the bears can get the day to close near its low, today will be a good sell signal bar on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of tomorrow and Friday selling off back to below the open of the week and therefore having a bear body on the weekly chart. But if the bulls can get today to close in the middle or back near the high, the EURUSD will probably be sideways to up tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-30-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini today rallied in a Bull Trend From The Open to above the February high and then entered a trading range for a couple hours. After the cash index went 4 cents above its February high, the Emini reversed down 27 points in 6 minutes! Of course there must have been news, but this was really just technical. I and other traders saw the February high as important resistance. The selloff continued to a new low of the day.<p>I have been saying in the chat room for a few days that the Emini was likely to pull back to the 60 minute EMA this week. Today’s collapsed down to it. Although it bounced for 30 minutes, the day returned to the low by the close of trading.<p>The Emini probably did not adequately test the September 16 lower high. Therefore, even though today is a reversal bar on the daily chart, there are likely buyers not far below today’s low. The Emini might pull back for a day or two, but traders should still expect it to test the September 16 lower high.<p>Unless the Emini breaks strongly above the September 16 lower high, traders will continue to expect it to break below last week’s low and the bottom of the 9 consecutive bull bars in July/August before making a new high.<h3>Final trading day in September</h3><p>Today was the final day in September. September was an outside down month and it had a big bear body. This is good for the bears and it increases the chance of another month or two of sideways to down trading.<p>However, September closed in the middle of the month’s range instead of on its low. Also, it followed 5 big bull bars. Therefore, the bulls will buy the 1st reversal down. This is true even if the Emini retraces half of the rally.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It normally would have at least a small 2nd leg up. However, with the insanity of last night’s presidential debate, the swing down might resume today. The country might be so distracted and angry that they might not be willing to buy right now, at least at the current price. We’ll find out today.<p>If today is not a huge bear day, the bulls will probably get at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. But if today is a huge bear day, the 3-day rally might be forming just another lower high in the 4-week bear trend.<p>I said yesterday that the pullback did not reach the 60-minute EMA. I further said that it might have to get down there before the bulls can get a 2nd leg up to the September 16 lower high.<p>Whether or not the rally continues up to above 3400, traders should expect the Emini to fall below the July 30 low at the bottom of that streak of 9 consecutive bull bars in early August. Consequently, the upside from here should be small, and the rally will likely end within a week or so, if it did not already end with the debate.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down only 3 points in the Globex market after selling off strongly from last night’s debate. So far, the technical factors are more important than the debate. As I said above, traders expect a 2-legged rally up to the top of the small wedge on the daily chart. As long as today is not a big bear day, that is still what is most likely.<p>Most of the trading over the past 2 days has been sideways. Since the Emini should work up to above 3400 over the next week, day traders will be looking to buy selloffs, hoping for a resumption of Monday’s rally.<p>Even if today is a 3rd consecutive sideways day, the daily ranges have been big. Therefore, day traders would expect at least one or two swing trades, even if today is a 3rd trading range day.<p>Can today be a huge bull or bear trend day? Any day can be. If there is a strong trend, up is more likely because the reversal up from the wedge bottom has not lasted as long as it should after a 3-week wedge. Also, it has not yet reached the start of the wedge, which traders expect it to do.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-weak-trend-reversal-up-into-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-30.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then weak trend reversal up into trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid.

This week pulled back to the breakout point at the bottom of an 8-week trading range.<p>Traders are deciding if the bear trend will continue down to support below. Unless the bulls get a couple closes above the September 17 low and the EMA, traders will expect the EURUSD to fall for about a measured move.<p>Furthermore, the July rally broke strongly above the March 9 and June 10 highs. Those were the breakout points at the top of a yearlong trading range. The EURUSD might now be working down to test those breakout points, which are about a measured move down.<h3>The bears need follow-through selling on the weekly chart</h3><p>The weekly chart is more important at the moment. Last week was a big bear bar closing on its low. It was a strong reversal down from a wedge rally to resistance.<p>This week is the follow-through bar. If it has a bear body, traders will see this week as confirmation of the reversal down. That will increase the chance of lower prices.<p>But if this week has a bull body, traders will wonder if last week’s bear breakout will fail. This is especially true if this week closes on its high.<p>If this week has a small bull body, traders will expect at least slightly lower prices, but they will see the selloff as just a pullback to the breakout points in the 5 month bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly yesterday to just above the September 17 low and the EMA. However, so far, today sold off from that resistance. Today is currently a bear body on the daily chart.<p>If today closes near its low, today will be a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a Low 1 bear flag. It would increase the chance of lower prices. However, the bears really need the week to close below the open. Then, this week would have a bear body on the weekly chart. That would confirm last week’s bear breakout and increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>Even though the EURUSD has trended down overnight, the selloff has not been strong. Day traders have been making money buying reversals up as well as selling small rallies.<p>The key today will be the close. If the bears can get the day to close near its low, today will be a good sell signal bar on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of tomorrow and Friday selling off back to below the open of the week and therefore having a bear body on the weekly chart. But if the bulls can get today to close in the middle or back near the high, the EURUSD will probably be sideways to up tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-9-30-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.
