On the monthly chart, November is a bear bar closing near its low, a monthly sell signal.<li>On the monthly chart, October was an outside up month after an outside down September. That created an OO setup, which is a Breakout Mode pattern.<li>The buy signal triggered when November traded above October’s high.<li>But now November is a sell signal bar for a failed OO buy signal. Unless today’s big gap up leads to a strong rally over the next few days, December should trade below the November low to trigger the sell signal.<li>Also, September was the 3<sup>rd</sup>attempt to reverse down on the monthly chart since the pandemic crash. It was therefore an attempt at a parabolic wedge top.<li>I said at the time that there typically would be a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar within a couple months. November is 2 months later, and it was a bear bar, as was likely. This met the minimum objective of the bears. The bulls hope December does not go below the November low. Instead, they will try to have it go above the November high and resume the bull trend on the monthly chart.<li>Is this the start of a correction? With 2 of the past 3 months having bear bodies and with the Emini turning down from the top of the bull channel on the weekly chart, traders know that there is an increased chance that December will be sideways to down.<li>If there is strong selling over the next week, the selloff could test the October low. That is the bottom of a trading range that began in July, and about a 10% correction.<li>As I wrote the other day, if the Emini gets there, it will probably bounce.<li>But the rally would likely be a lower high. At that point, traders would begin to talk about a head and shoulders top where the September 2 high was the left shoulder.<li>What is most likely over the next few weeks? How far down can this go?<li>I mentioned that the selloff would probably test below the September 2 high, which is just a little below yesterday’s low. That was the breakout point of the October rally, and the Emini might still be in the trading range that began in July. When it is in a trading range, it typically tests beyond breakout points.<li>That low is also at the 50-day moving average, which is another magnet below.<li>A 50% correction is at 4504.00, just above the 4500 Big Round Number.<li>The yearly chart closes at the end of December. I will show it in January. It is a big bull bar closing near its high. Most big bars have tails on top that come from a small reversal just before the bar closes. That is what might be happening now. But remember, a small reversal on the yearly chart can be a big reversal on the daily chart.<li>I have said many times that the bears have never had more than a 50% chance of a correction since the pandemic began. That is still the case. They will need several more bear days to get the probability up to 50%. If instead there are a few bull days, the year will probably close on the high.<li>As I have been saying since the pandemic low, a new high is always at least slightly more likely than a correction because of the strong bull trend on the weekly and monthly charts. That is still true today.<li>However, this rally has been extreme and it should attract some protracted profit taking before too long. If December sells off, it could create a correction on the daily chart while being just a 2-bar pullback on the monthly chart.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 55 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>A big gap up increases the chance of a trend day. The odds are slightly greater that the trend will be in the direction of the gap (here, up).<li>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the EMA. Bulls do not want to pay a price that is far above average unless the bars are all above average bullishness.<li>Therefore, if there is not a series of strong bull bars on the open, there will probably be an opening trading range for an hour or two. The bears will look to sell a double top or a wedge top.<li>The bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom near the EMA.<li>Can today be a big bear day and trigger the monthly sell signal? It is unlikely when there is a very big gap up from a sell climax. The bears who sold yesterday will look for any selloff today to buy back their shorts with a smaller loss.<li>Most likely, the strong selling over the past week will transition into a trading range for a few days. Traders will then decide whether to continue up to a new high by the end of the year or resume down to below last month’s low and trigger the monthly sell signal.<li>Even if today is a trading range day, the daily ranges lately have been very big. That will probably result in at least one swing up and one swing down today.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emini-wedge-rally-to-EMA-then-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-1.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge rally to EMA then trending trading range day. A monthly sell signal on monthly chart.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Forex-weak-reversal-up-from-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-1-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weak reversal up from parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday was a big bar with big tail above and below. It was a trading range bar. It increases the chance of a trading range over the next couple weeks. Trading ranges often have both double tops and double bottoms. A test of the November 24 low and a bounce would create a double bottom.<li>Yesterday had a bull body and it followed a reversal up from a parabolic wedge and a failed breakout below the bear channel on the weekly chart. It will probably trade sideways to up for at least a couple weeks. But sideways means that it might test last week’s low before going up.<li>There is an increased chance that today will remain an inside day. It would then be both a buy and sell signal bar.<li>The bears hope that yesterday formed a double top bear flag with the November 18 high. They hope today to close near its low so that it would be a higher probability sell signal bar.<li>They want an outside down bar on the weekly chart and a resumption of the bear trend.<li>They are hoping that the 2021 bear trend falls below the last year’s low and the bottom of the 7-year trading range.<li>Since the monthly chart has been in a trading range for 7 years, it is more likely that the EURUSD will enter a trading range lasting a couple months before it breaks to a new low, if it breaks to a new low. Last week might be the start of the trading range.<li>The bulls want today to close near its high. They hope that last week’s reversal up is the start of a Small Pullback bull trend that will continue to the November 9 high, which is the top of the most recent sell climax. The probability will be greater if today closes near its high.<li>The context on the daily and weekly charts still favors sideways to up trading for at least a couple weeks. There might be more buyers than sellers below last week’s low.<li>If the bulls start to get a series of bull bars, traders will begin to look for a trading range that could last a couple months.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-small-pullback-bear-trend-and-monthly-sell-signal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then small pullback bear trend and monthly sell signal\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Today began with a big gap up. That reduced the chance that the day would rally from the open and be a big bull trend day.<li>It reversed down from a wedge top at just above yesterday’s high.<li>The 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down from the wedge top broke strongly to below the head and shoulders top.<li>It then traded below yesterday’s low to become an outside down day.<li>Yesterday’s low was also the November low, and therefore the Emini triggered a monthly sell signal today for a failed breakout above the October OO. That increases the chance of lower prices in December.<li>When a higher time frame sell signal triggers, there is typically a pullback above the low of the sell signal bar. If the bulls get that this week, the bears will then try a 2<sup>nd</sup>time, and hope for a bear trend on the daily chart.<li>I said a few times recently that the reversal down should test the September 2 high, which was the breakout point of the October rally. Today broke below it at the end of the day.<li>The Emini probably will reach other targets below over the next week. The 50% pullback is around the 4500 Big Round Number. The 150-day MA and the bottom of the bull channel a little further down. All are magnets below.<li>There is a 40% chance that the selloff will continue down to the October low.<li>Big Up, Big Down on the daily chart creates Big Confusion. That typically results in a trading range. The bottom of the range might be around today’s low or all the way down to the October low.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini is reversing up from sell climax.<li>It reversed up from a 7-day micro wedge bottom and from a parabolic wedge bottom (November 23, November 26, December 1).<li>The reversal was also from just below the September 2 high, which was the breakout point of the October rally. I have been saying that the Emini was likely to fall below that high.<li>The reversal was also from below the November low. Remember, Wednesday triggered a monthly sell signal by trading below the November low, which was Tuesday’s low.<li>The low was just below the 50-day MA and just above the 100-day MA, which are support.<li>Yesterday is a buy signal bar for today.<li>The bulls hope that the climactic selloff will lead to a rally. They want the year to close on the high, which would increase the chance of higher prices early next year.<li>If the year closes on the high, the Emini will be above the November high. December would then be an outside up bar, increasing the chance of higher prices in January.<li>If January were to gap up, there would be a rare gap on the yearly chart. I do not know if that has ever happened in the 100+ years of the S&amp;P.<li>The bears hope that any rally will form a lower high. They would then want the selloff to resume from a lower high major trend reversal.<li>While the selloff has been strong, it was climactic. Yesterday reversed up from a cluster of support. That includes the 50- and 100-day moving averages, the September 2 high, the 4500 Big Round Number, and about a 50% retracement of the October rally.<li>The strong selloff is good for the bears, but the big reversal from support is good for the bulls. That creates confusion, which usually results in a trading range.<li>With yesterday’s range being big, there is an increased chance that today will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive inside bar. There would then be an ii (inside-inside), which is a Breakout Mode pattern. That means it would then be both a buy and sell signal bar.<li>The bulls want strong follow-through buying today. If today is a big bull bar closing near its high, it will increase the chance of a December rally to a new all-time high.<li>The bears want a bear bar closing near its low today or Monday. Or, they want any rally to reverse down from a good sell signal bar. They then hope that the selloff reverses the entire October rally.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The high and low of the week are probably too far to get there today. Therefore, the midpoint might be important.<li>If the bulls get the week to close above its midpoint, it slightly increases the chance of higher prices next week.<li>The bears want the week to close below the midpoint. Yesterday closed just slightly below that level.<li>Since this week triggered a monthly sell signal, the bears would also like the week to close below the November low, which is just below yesterday’s close. Below that is the September 2 high, which is also a magnet below.<li>What is most likely? With every selloff since the pandemic low, I have said the same thing. For most, I said the odds favored a quick resumption of the bull trend.<li>In September 2020 and September 2021, I said the bears had a 50% chance of a 10% correction.

The Emini is reversing up from sell climax.<li>It reversed up from a 7-day micro wedge bottom and from a parabolic wedge bottom (November 23, November 26, December 1).<li>The reversal was also from just below the September 2 high, which was the breakout point of the October rally. I have been saying that the Emini was likely to fall below that high.<li>The reversal was also from below the November low. Remember, Wednesday triggered a monthly sell signal by trading below the November low, which was Tuesday’s low.<li>The low was just below the 50-day MA and just above the 100-day MA, which are support.<li>Yesterday is a buy signal bar for today.<li>The bulls hope that the climactic selloff will lead to a rally. They want the year to close on the high, which would increase the chance of higher prices early next year.<li>If the year closes on the high, the Emini will be above the November high. December would then be an outside up bar, increasing the chance of higher prices in January.<li>If January were to gap up, there would be a rare gap on the yearly chart. I do not know if that has ever happened in the 100+ years of the S&amp;P.<li>The bears hope that any rally will form a lower high. They would then want the selloff to resume from a lower high major trend reversal.<li>While the selloff has been strong, it was climactic. Yesterday reversed up from a cluster of support. That includes the 50- and 100-day moving averages, the September 2 high, the 4500 Big Round Number, and about a 50% retracement of the October rally.<li>The strong selloff is good for the bears, but the big reversal from support is good for the bulls. That creates confusion, which usually results in a trading range.<li>With yesterday’s range being big, there is an increased chance that today will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive inside bar. There would then be an ii (inside-inside), which is a Breakout Mode pattern. That means it would then be both a buy and sell signal bar.<li>The bulls want strong follow-through buying today. If today is a big bull bar closing near its high, it will increase the chance of a December rally to a new all-time high.<li>The bears want a bear bar closing near its low today or Monday. Or, they want any rally to reverse down from a good sell signal bar. They then hope that the selloff reverses the entire October rally.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The high and low of the week are probably too far to get there today. Therefore, the midpoint might be important.<li>If the bulls get the week to close above its midpoint, it slightly increases the chance of higher prices next week.<li>The bears want the week to close below the midpoint. Yesterday closed just slightly below that level.<li>Since this week triggered a monthly sell signal, the bears would also like the week to close below the November low, which is just below yesterday’s close. Below that is the September 2 high, which is also a magnet below.<li>What is most likely? With every selloff since the pandemic low, I have said the same thing. For most, I said the odds favored a quick resumption of the bull trend.<li>In September 2020 and September 2021, I said the bears had a 50% chance of a 10% correction. But I also said that meant that the bulls had a 50% chance of a new high.<li>At no time since the pandemic low have the bears had better than a 50% chance of a correction. That is true here as well.<li>Unless the bears break strongly below the support, the odds will still favor the bulls. If the Emini begins to get some bull bars, traders will see the selloff as just a sell-vacuum test of support in a bull trend.<li>We should find out next week. If next week remains unclear, the odds would begin to favor the Emini going sideways into the end of the year.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 18 points in the overnight Globex session.

On the weekly chart, that is at least a couple of months.&nbsp;<li>If those legs are strong, there could be a rally back to the October 28 high, which was the start of the most recent sell climax and therefore a magnet.&nbsp;<li>If the current pullback is more sideways, it would increase the chance of another leg down. The bears are hoping that this rally will quickly form a bear flag and then resume the yearlong bear trend.<li>However, with the chart in a 7-year trading range, traders still expect a couple of months of sideways to up trading to begin soon. Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago. A couple months of sideways to up trading is likely before there is a breakout below the bottom of the 7-year range, if there is going to be a breakout below the bottom before a breakout above the top.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"5-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Daily-Weak-Pullback-From-TCL-Overshoot.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-5-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Daily Chart Weak Pullback from TCL Overshoot\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD formed an outside up bar on Tuesday, but it had prominent tails above and below the bar and it stalled at the high from 8 bars earlier.<li>Thursday broke below the bear inside bar, and the bears want a strong reversal down from a double top bear flag (November 18 and 30).

It closed near its low with a long tail above, and it also closed below October high.<li>It is a sell signal bar for a failed breakout above the Sept-Oct OO (outside-outside) pattern.<li>If there is a selloff and it breaks below the OO, that would trigger an OO sell signal.<li>But because the bull trend is so strong, it is a minor sell signal. That means the best the bears can probably get is 2 or 3 sideways to down bars to maybe a little below the October low.<li>However, when there is a reversal from an extreme buy climax, the market often enters a trading range. For example, the Emini went sideways for 2 years after the January 2018 buy climax.<li>The bulls hope that December reverses up to a new high before the end of the year. If it did, it would be an outside up bar, which is bullish.<li>However, it would be the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg up since September, and a third leg up often attracts profit takers. In this case, it would also be a micro wedge.<li>Therefore, while the Emini might make a new high in December or early in 2022, it probably will not last long. There is better than a 50% chance of at least a couple months sideways to down trading beginning within the next few months. It might have already begun.<li>Al said that when October formed a big bear bar, that there should be a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar within 2 months. Sometimes it comes in the 3<sup>rd</sup>month. November became that 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar.<li>The bears see November as a reasonable sell signal bar as it closed near its low. They want a strong reversal down from a failed OO buy signal.<li>The bulls want the Emini to resume up in a Small Pullback Bull Trend.<li>Al mentioned that the year opened on its low and it is now near its high. On the yearly chart (Al will show the chart in early January), 2021 is a big bull bar that currently has a small tail above.<li>Most big bull bars have conspicuous tails on top (in this case, 1 bar on the yearly chart is 1 year). It usually comes from a pullback just before the bar closes. That is why Al said that there was an increased chance of a reversal in December. Bars often change their appearance just before they close, and what happens in December is just before the 2021 bar closes on the yearly chart.<li>The computers know this tendency. Bull computers will try to overwhelm the bear computers and get the year to close on its high. That could even lead to a gap up in January, which would create a gap up on the daily, monthly and yearly charts. With the final trading day of 2021 being a Friday, there would also be a gap up on the weekly chart.<li>Therefore, there is an increased chance of a big move in either direction in December.<li>If the year closes on its high, there will be an increased chance of higher prices early next year.<li>But if December is a bear bar closing near its low on the monthly chart, the new year will probably trade down.<li>The strong bull trend should soon transition into a trading range for several months and possibly longer.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Weekly-Bear-Follow-Through-Testing-Bull-Trend-Line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-5-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Weekly Chart Bear Follow Through Testing Bull Trend Line\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was the 2nd consecutive big bear bar closing near its low. That is a Bear Surprise, which typically will lead to at least slightly lower prices within a few bars.<li>The prominent tail below indicates the bears are not as strong as they could have been.<li>The bears need to break the bull trend line with a consecutive bear bars closing near their low to convince traders that a correction is underway. Below that bull trend line, the next target for the bears is the Oct low.<li>The current sell-off is in a support zone. It is around a 50% pullback, near the bottom of the bull channel, and testing the September 2 high.<li>Since it has not quite reached the bear trend line, many traders may not buy aggressively until they believe the support has been adequately tested.<li>Is this the start of a correction? The Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. If there is follow-through selling next week, this will be another one of those times.<li>The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs like in September in 2020 and again 2021 push the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>If the bulls get a strong reversal up next week, the probability of a new high by the end of the year will be again back to 60%.<li>Odds slightly favor sideways to down next week, but a strong reversal back up can come at any moment as the Emini is still in a Small Pullback Trend.</ul><h3 id=\"9-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Daily-Pullback-Testing-100-Day-MA-Bull-Trend-Line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-5-5.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart Pullback Testing 100-Day MA &amp; Bull Trend Line\"></a></figure><ul><li>The current pullback is around a 50% pullback from the Oct rally. It is also around the 50-day and 100-day moving averages and just above the bull trend line which are support zones.<li>Finally, it dipped below the September 2 high, which was likely. Al has said several times in November that the Emini would do that because it is a breakout point and there was a buy climax. The October rally could still be part of the trading range that began in July.<li>While it is not obvious, this selloff is a micro wedge, which increases the chance of a reversal up. There are 2 ways to look at this as a micro wedge.<li>For the 1<sup>st</sup>interpretation, the 1<sup>st</sup>push down was on Tuesday. Wednesday opened near Tuesday’s high and sold off again for a 2<sup>nd</sup>push down. Friday made a new low and it was a 3<sup>rd</sup>push down.<li>The 2<sup>nd</sup>interpretations is that the micro wedge began 7 days ago. Then, Friday is the breakout below the wedge.<li>These repeated failed attempts down are a problem for the bears. They might give up. If they do, the year could still close at a new high.<li>However, if the Emini breaks strongly below the micro wedge low (Friday’s low, which was also the week’s low), traders should expect about a measured move down. That is almost exactly at the October low and almost exactly a 10% correction. Both of these targets are magnets.<li>The bulls want this selloff to fail. If next week breaks below the micro wedge, traders should understand that breakouts below wedges fail about 50% of the time.<li>If there is a strong breakout with strong follow-through selling, the probability of a test of the October low before there is a new high will be 50%.<li>We will find out next week. A strong reversal up will probably lead to a test of the all-time high by the end of the year. A strong selloff next will will probably lead to a test of the October low.<li>In situations like this, the market often goes sideways for several days before deciding on the direction.<li>It has been sideways for 3 days.<li>Friday was a big outside day. The day after an outside down often is an inside day. If that happens on Monday, there would be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is Breakout Mode. Monday would be both a buy and sell signal bar.<li>It is important to understand that the 1<sup>st</sup>breakout of a Breakout Mode pattern fails and reverses 50% of the time.<li>In any case, next week should give traders an idea of what to expect for the rest of 2021… up, down, or mostly sideways.<li>Al has been saying that the Emini might just go sideways before deciding between going up to the high or down to the October low.<li>When the chart is not clear, it usually goes sideways. It could be sideways for a few days or a month or two.<li>At the moment, the chart is not clear. The Emini has been reversing every day or two.<li>Consecutive big bull bars would swing the odds back in the bull’s favor, while consecutive big bear bars would increase the bear’s odds of a deeper pullback.<li>Traders will be monitoring whether the bears can break below the confluence of support at around the 4500 Big Round Number.</ul><h2 id=\"10-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That increases the chance that today could be sideways again.<li>If today is an inside day, there would be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern on the daily chart. That is a Breakout Mode pattern. Today would then be both a buy and sell signal bar.<li>The bulls had a 7-day micro wedge as of last Wednesday, and it is in a support zone.<li>It was around a 50% pullback, the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, the November low (December triggered a sell signal when it traded below the November low), just below the September 2 high (the breakout point of the October rally), and almost down to the bottom of the bull channels on the daily (around 4443) and weekly charts (around 4470).<li>Friday broke slightly below that micro wedge bottom, but reversed up into the end of the day.<li>A breakout below a wedge bottom has a 50% chance of failing and reversing up, and a 50% chance of continuing down. If it continues down, a reasonable target is a measured move based on the height of the wedge, which would be down around the October low.<li>Is there a 50% chance of a correction down to the October low before there is a new high? Not yet, but a couple big bear bars this week would make it likely.<li>There are several gaps in the October rally that are also magnets below, but the October low is the most important magnet. That is almost exactly a 10% correction.<li>Selloffs tend to stop at certain percentages down from the high, like 1%, 2%, 5%, 15%, and 20%. That means they get drawn to those numbers. That is another reason why the October low is so important.<li>If the Emini gets there, it will officially be in a correction. The definition of a correction is a 10% selloff. The definition of a bear trend is a 20% selloff.<li>I have said a few times that if the Emini gets to the October low, it will probably rally for a month or two. The bulls will hope for a double bottom and then a new high.<li>However, if it rallies from the October low, it will probably form a lower high and turn down again. Then traders will begin to talk about a head and shoulders top.<li>Only about 40% of head and shoulders tops lead to bear trends (and about a measured move down).<li>A head and shoulders top is a trading range and usually a triangle. A continuation of the trading range or a resumption of the bull trend happens 60% of the time. But a 40% chance of a bear trend is enough for traders to be prepared for a bigger selloff.<li>I have been saying that the Emini might just go sideways before deciding between going up to the high or down to the October low. When the chart is not clear, it usually goes sideways. It could be sideways for a few days or for a month or two.<li>At the moment, the chart is not clear. The Emini has been reversing every day or two.<li>But consecutive big bull bars would be clearly bullish, and consecutive big bear bars would be clearly bearish.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 24 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Friday’s low is a lower low double bottom with Wednesday’s low.<li>The bulls want the reversal up that began at the end of Friday to continue up above Friday’s high, which is the neckline of the micro double bottom. They then want a measured move up to the all-time high before the end of the month.<li>The bears want any rally today or tomorrow to fail at or below Friday’s high. They then want a break below the double bottom and a measured move down to near the October low.<li>The Emini has been sideways for 3 days. That increases the chance of today being another sideways day.<li>Friday was a sell climax day. There is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>Because of the double bottom at a cluster of support on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day today.<li>After 4 big bear days and a failure to break through support, there is a smaller chance of a big bear day today. But if there is a series of big bear bars early in the day and a break below Friday’s low, then traders will look for a bear trend day.<li>Today will most likely be sideways or up.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and outside down day. Deciding between and Emini new high or October Low test.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Forex-in-3-week-trading-range-in-bear-trend-so-bear-flag-and-sell-climax-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-6-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex in 3 week trading range in bear trend so bear flag and sell climax bottom\"></a></figure><ul><li>Trading range for 3 weeks so Breakout Mode. Today so far is a small bear inside candlestick, which is a continuation of the trading range.<li>Thursday triggered a Low 2 and a double top sell signal (Nov. 10/Nov. 30), but there has not been follow-through selling. There is no sense that the price is terribly wrong.<li>Traders are deciding if there will be a higher low reversal and a measured move up to the October 27 high, or a break below the November low, which is the neckline of the double top, and then a measured move down.<li>Friday was a bull doji bar, which is a weak buy signal bar for a High 1 in a Small Pullback Bull Trend.<li>The bulls want a measured move up to the November 9 top of the most recent sell climax.<li>The probability is about 50% for each. Also, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail.<li>It is important to remember that the EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year trading range. Also, the selloff was climactic. That makes it likely to go sideways to up for a couple months soon, whether or not it ultimately breaks below last year’s low and the bottom of the 7-year range.<li>On the weekly chart, last week triggered a buy signal for a failed breakout below a bear channel.<li>Last week was a doji bar with a small bull body. This is not yet a clear reversal up.<li>As I said, there will probably be a trading range lasting a couple months starting soon. The past 2 weeks had prominent tails, which is often an early sign of a trading range. There might be another brief leg down before the bear trend transitions into a trading range.<li>Less likely, the bear trend will continue down in a tight bear channel to below last year’s low.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SP500-Emini-Trade-Setups-211206.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-6-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini trade setups - Small pullback bull trend then trading range\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>After a 2-bar sell climax on the open, the Emini reversed up in a Small Pullback Bull Trend From The Open.<li>There were 2 tight trading ranges lasting at least 10 bars.

But if there is a series of big bear bars early in the day and a break below Friday’s low, then traders will look for a bear trend day.<li>Today will most likely be sideways or up.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and outside down day.

A minor reversal in December rally.<li>Yesterday is a sell signal bar for a lower high major trend reversal.<li>However, after a Bull Surprise on Monday and Tuesday, traders expect at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up. They will buy a 1- to 3-day selloff, and this sell signal is therefore minor.<li>How high can this rally go before there is a correction lasting more than a couple months and falling more than 10%? Years. Just look at the rally that began in 1995.<li>Picking tops in strong trends is a losing bet. It is always more likely that every reversal down will soon be followed by a new high. That is true here as well.<li>I have a friend who is not very bright, but he always buys every 10% selloff and he never sells. He has been doing this for 40 years and is now quite rich. Maybe he is brighter than I think!<li>There are targets around 4800 and 4900, and 5000 is a very Big Round Number.<li>Reversals always end at resistance, but they usually go through many resistance levels before ending.<li>But with the market up 100% in less than 2 years, it is likely to correct before going much higher.<li>The weekly chart triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal when this week went above last week’s high.<li>But last week was a big bear bar and it was the 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive big bear bar. That is why I said last week that it is a weak buy signal, even though the bull trend is strong. I mentioned that there might be more bears eager to sell above the bad buy signal bar than bulls willing to buy.<li>The Emini spent the last 3 days oscillating around last week’s high as it decides whether to break to a new high this year. The bulls would like this week, when it closes today, to close near the high of the week and above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<li>The bears would like this week to be a bear bar, but that is unlikely. At a minimum, they would like this week to close below last week’s high.<li>It would be better for the bears if the week closed below the midpoint of the week. The bigger the tail on top of this week’s candlestick, the lower the probability of higher prices next week.<li>Therefore, last week’s high might be an important magnet today, especially in the final hour.<li>On the monthly chart, the bears want Dec to close near its low and below the Nov low. That would increase the chance of lower prices in Jan.<li>I have said many times that the bulls want the year to close at a new high. If that happens, December will be an outside up month, like October. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices in January.<li>But if there is a new high and January becomes a bear bar, there would be a micro wedge on the monthly chart (which would correspond to a traditional wedge on the daily chart). Traders would then expect sideways to down trading for a month or two.<li>The initial downside target is the October low, which is the start of the 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up in the wedge. That low is the bottom of the Sept/Oct OO (consecutive outside bars) on the monthly chart.<li>If there is a wedge reversal, it often continues down to where the wedge began. That is not clear, but the May 12 low or the March 4 low are two possibilities.<li>A big correction like that is unlikely over the next few months, but if there is a strong break below the October low, that is the next support.<li>By this month going below the Nov low, this month triggered a sell signal for a failed breakout above the OO. The bulls are trying to erase this sell signal by having December or January going above the November high. The OO bulls would then conclude that their OO buy signal is back on track.<li>Before this week’s rally, I said it was slightly more likely that the Emini would reverse up and test the old high than it would break strongly below last week’s low. This week’s strong rally increases the probability further.<li>It is important to note that the Emini’s rally has lasted an extremely long time without more than a 10% correction. Traders should watch for topping patterns and a transition in to trading range for a least several months.<li>I mentioned above that if there is a new high in Dec or Jan and then a reversal, there would be a wedge top. If there is then a series of bear bars, traders will look for a couple legs sideways down down. As a guide, they should expect the reversal to last about half as long as the wedge. Since the wedge began this summer, a reversal down could easily last a couple months.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 33 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Possible gap up above yesterday’s high so increased chance of trend day. If there is a trend, up is more likely.<li>Bulls want breakout above 4700 Big Round Number and all-time high.<li>Bears want reversal down from double top with Wednesday’s high.<li>Big gap up from yesterday’s close so increased chance of trading range open.<li>Bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom near the EMA.<li>Bears will look to sell a wedge rally or double top.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, traders will expect a trend from the open. However, there is an 80% chance of a trading range for the 1<sup>st</sup>hour or two.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-late-bear-breakout-below-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-10.png\" alt=\"Emini late bear breakout below trading range.

There is both a lower high and a higher low, and you could call this a triangle.<li>That does not change things because the trading range alone is a Breakout Mode pattern. That means there is a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout, a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout, and a 50% chance that the 1<sup>st</sup>breakout up or down will fail.<li>I have been saying that because the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years, the odds of more reversals are greater than those of a breakout of the 7-year range.<li>The current leg down has lasted a year. While it could last longer, it will probably reverse up for at least a couple months before breaking below last year’s low and the 2017 low at the bottom of the 7-year range.<li>The bulls want this triangle to be a base and the start of a rally up to the November 9 high, which is the start of the most recent leg down and therefore a magnet.<li>If there is a bear breakout, the 3-week trading range is a good candidate for a final bear flag. That means there is an increased chance of a reversal up from around a measured move down below the 3-week range.<li>Currencies have a tendency to reverse around the 1st of the year. That increases the chance of a breakout above the 3-week triangle soon or of a reversal up after a bear breakout.<li>Since the bear trend has been strong on the daily and weekly charts (it is just a pullback to the middle of the 7-year range on the monthly chart), the odds always continue to favor at least slightly lower prices.<li>However, because of what I wrote above, traders should be aware that a 2-month reversal up can start at any time.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-bill-trend-reversal-after-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-10-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>After big gap up, Trading Range Open and test of EMA likely.

More likely, the Emini will continue up to the end of the year.<li>With today closing near its high, there is an increased chance of gap up on Monday. That would create a gap up on daily and weekly charts.<li>Bulls trying to get December to go above November’s high. It probably will. December would then be an outside up month, which would increase the change of higher prices in January.<li>If December closes near its high, January could gap up on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts.<li>But if there is a new high, which is likely, and then a reversal, there would be a micro wedge top on the monthly chart and a wedge top on the daily chart.<li>That could lead to a pullback for a couple months, and possibly a trading range for several months.<li>If there is a reversal, the 1<sup>st</sup>target would be the most recent major higher low, which is the October low.<li>At the moment, December will likely continue higher.

If December closes near the high, which is likely, January might gap up above the December high. There would then be a gap up on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. I do not know if that has ever happened.<li>If January made a new high and there was a reversal down in January or February, there would be a micro wedge top. That would probably lead to a couple bars (months) of sideways to down trading.<li>There were consecutive outside bars in September and October. November triggered an OO buy signal. December triggered a sell signal for a failed OO bull flag.<li>The bull trend is now resuming in December. There will be another buy signal if December breaks above the November sell signal bar high, which should happen before the end of the month.<li>While the bull trend has been surprisingly strong, it is too strong. The Emini typically does not double every 21 months. It averages about 8% a year.<li>If it is up over 100% in 2 years, for it to get back to an 8% average, it will need many years with less than an 8% gain.<li>While a bull trend can last a long time (look back at 1995), it will transition into a trading range (look at 2000). Traders should expect at least a couple sideways years staring within the next couple of years.<li>The trading range after 2000 lasted 10 years. There were selloffs of 50 and 70%.<li>After the strong bull trend in the 1960s, the stock market also went sideways for about a decade. During that time, there were 2 selloffs of at least 40%.<li>That is our future. While the Baby Boomers are very happy today, within a few years, they will be eating peanut butter instead of steak.<li>Al has said that because the bull trend is so strong, November was a minor sell signal. That means the best the bears can probably get is 2 or 3 sideways to down bars to maybe a little below the October low.&nbsp;That will still be true if there is a micro wedge top in January or February.<li>But a 2-month selloff could be the beginning of a trading range that could last a year or more. For example, the Emini went sideways for 2 years after the January 2018 buy climax.<li>Therefore, while the Emini might make a new high in December or early in 2022, it probably will not last long. There is better than a 50% chance of at least a couple of months sideways to down trading beginning within the next few months. It might have already begun.<li>While December will probably close at a new all-time high and it might break above 4800, it is still early in the month. There is plenty of time for a bear surprise, causing the monthly bar to look very different by the end of the month.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Weekly-Bull-Bar-Closing-At-Weekly-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-12-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Bull Bar Closing at Weekly High\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a surprisingly big bull bar closing near its high.<li>We have said that a strong reversal back up can come at any moment because the Emini is still in a Small Pullback Trend.<li>Since this week was big bull bar closing near its high, the probability of a new high by the end of the year is back to 60%.<li>The next target for the bulls is the top of the trend channel line around 4850.

Since this week closed near its high, it is a good buy signal bar for next week. Monday may gap up on the weekly chart.<li>However, last week was a bear bar and there were consecutive bear bars. That is a weak High 1 buy signal and it reduces the chance of the Emini going far above last week’s high without another pullback.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%.

If so, January might gap up, creating a gap on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts.<li>December triggered a monthly sell signal when it traded below the November low. If the year closes at a new high, it will be above the November high, which would erase the November sell signal.<li>If December closes below the November low, especially if it closes on its low, January should trade down as well.<li>Which will it be, a new high and higher prices in January, or a reversal down? While it might appear to be 50-50, in a bull trend, the probability is always at least slightly better for the bulls.<li>There is a consensus that the Fed messed up by downplaying inflation. And the Fed knows it. Therefore, they will increase the rate of taper and they will raise interest rates sooner than what they have been saying. That is priced in. However, the market might sell off anytime, at least for a day or two, if the Fed says it in today’s statement.<li>There are still a couple weeks left in December. Even if the Emini were to sell off for a couple more days, the bulls still would have enough time for the year to close at a new high.<li>However, the bigger the selloff, the more likely January will continue down to the October low, which would be a 10% correction.<li>The chart is not particularly clear. That means it is in a trading range.<li>In a trading range, nothing is as clear as traders want. They will buy as the market goes down, sell as it goes up, and take quick profits. The result is a continuation of the range.<li>At some point there will be a breakout up or down, and then another trend. But until there is a clear breakout, traders will continue to look for reversals.<li>What about the 5-day island top that formed when yesterday gapped down?<li>Island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns. That means they do not typically lead to trends, although trends rarely do begin with island tops or bottoms.<li>While the 2-day selloff was strong, last week’s rally was stronger. Yesterday’s low was an exact 50% pullback from the December rally.<li>The bears hope that last week’s rally was a buy vacuum test of the November high. They want the 2-day reversal down (from the lower high double top with the November high) to grow into a bear trend.<li>It probably won’t. Remember, when a market is in a trading range, it tends to reverse, especially once it looks particularly bullish or bearish.<li>One other difficulty in a trading range is that if a leg grows into a trend, the trend is usually not clear until it is about half over. That means that a clear trend usually will not last much longer before becoming unclear again.<li>Until things are clear, the odds favor reversals every few days.<li>Also, if there is a big move from here to the end of the year, up is still slightly more likely. Even though 4800 is far above, it is still within reach.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 1 point in the overnight Globex session, which has been in a tight trading range around yesterday’s close. So far it is a continuation of yesterday’s neutrality (a doji bar at a 50% retracement of the December rally).<li>While the Emini will probably begin as neutral today, it can always trend in either direction ahead of today’s FOMC announcement at 11 am PT.<li>Day traders will trade like any other day ahead of the announcement.<li>They should exit day trades ahead of the report.<li>In the 1<sup>st</sup>few minutes after the FOMC announcement, the market typically makes a quick move in both directions. It is therefore better to not day trade again until at least 10 minutes after the announcement.<li>After the announcement, be ready for anything, which means a strong trend in either direction, a reversal, or a trading range.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-midday-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom-and-50-pullback.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-15.png\" alt=\"Emini midday bull trend reversal from wedge bottom and 50% pullback.

If so, January might gap up, creating a gap on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts.<li>December triggered a monthly sell signal when it traded below the November low. If the year closes at a new high, it will be above the November high, which would erase the November sell signal.<li>If December closes below the November low, especially if it closes on its low, January should trade down as well.<li>Which will it be, a new high and higher prices in January, or a reversal down? While it might appear to be 50-50, in a bull trend, the probability is always at least slightly better for the bulls.<li>There is a consensus that the Fed messed up by downplaying inflation. And the Fed knows it. Therefore, they will increase the rate of taper and they will raise interest rates sooner than what they have been saying. That is priced in. However, the market might sell off anytime, at least for a day or two, if the Fed says it in today’s statement.<li>There are still a couple weeks left in December. Even if the Emini were to sell off for a couple more days, the bulls still would have enough time for the year to close at a new high.<li>However, the bigger the selloff, the more likely January will continue down to the October low, which would be a 10% correction.<li>The chart is not particularly clear. That means it is in a trading range.<li>In a trading range, nothing is as clear as traders want. They will buy as the market goes down, sell as it goes up, and take quick profits. The result is a continuation of the range.<li>At some point there will be a breakout up or down, and then another trend. But until there is a clear breakout, traders will continue to look for reversals.<li>What about the 5-day island top that formed when yesterday gapped down?<li>Island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns. That means they do not typically lead to trends, although trends rarely do begin with island tops or bottoms.<li>While the 2-day selloff was strong, last week’s rally was stronger. Yesterday’s low was an exact 50% pullback from the December rally.<li>The bears hope that last week’s rally was a buy vacuum test of the November high. They want the 2-day reversal down (from the lower high double top with the November high) to grow into a bear trend.<li>It probably won’t. Remember, when a market is in a trading range, it tends to reverse, especially once it looks particularly bullish or bearish.<li>One other difficulty in a trading range is that if a leg grows into a trend, the trend is usually not clear until it is about half over. That means that a clear trend usually will not last much longer before becoming unclear again.<li>Until things are clear, the odds favor reversals every few days.<li>Also, if there is a big move from here to the end of the year, up is still slightly more likely. Even though 4800 is far above, it is still within reach.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 1 point in the overnight Globex session, which has been in a tight trading range around yesterday’s close. So far it is a continuation of yesterday’s neutrality (a doji bar at a 50% retracement of the December rally).<li>While the Emini will probably begin as neutral today, it can always trend in either direction ahead of today’s FOMC announcement at 11 am PT.<li>Day traders will trade like any other day ahead of the announcement.<li>They should exit day trades ahead of the report.<li>In the 1<sup>st</sup>few minutes after the FOMC announcement, the market typically makes a quick move in both directions. It is therefore better to not day trade again until at least 10 minutes after the announcement.<li>After the announcement, be ready for anything, which means a strong trend in either direction, a reversal, or a trading range.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-midday-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom-and-50-pullback.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-15.png\" alt=\"Emini midday bull trend reversal from wedge bottom and 50% pullback.

Yesterday’s low was above Wednesday’s low.<li>Emini bulls want breakout above November all-time high. The bulls hope that yesterday was just a deep pullback from Wednesday’s rally. They want the year to close at a new high.<li>The bears want yesterday to be the start of a reversal down from a double top with the November 22 high.<li>Remember, as long as December stays below the November high, the Emini is still on a Low 2 top sell signal on the monthly chart.<li>The bull trend on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts make a new high more likely than a reversal down to below the November low. There is enough time remaining in December for the Emini to pull back a little more and still end the year at a new high.<li>But if the bears can get a few consecutive big bear days, the odds will favor a test of the December low before there is a new high.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 30+ points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap down.<li>However, yesterday was a sell climax day. That means there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading beginning by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour today.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance are important, especially in the final hour.<li>The bears want a bear bar on the weekly chart. They want it to close near the low of the week, which is unlikely. At a minimum, they want it to close below the midpoint.<li>The closer to the low of the week that it closes, the less likely the Emini will finish the year at a new high.<li>The bulls want the week to have a bull body. With the Emini currently about 70 points below the open of the week, that is unlikely. At a minimum, they want the week to close above its midpoint. That would increase the chance of sideways to up trading next week.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-lower-high-double-top-major-trend-reversal-and-small-pullback-bear-trend-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-17.png\" alt=\"Emini lower high double top major trend reversal and small pullback bear trend. Bulls want breakout above November all-time high.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Forex-trading-range-with-double-bottom-and-double-top-so-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-17-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex trading range with double bottom and double top so breakout mode\"></a></figure><ul><li>Tight trading range for a month so Breakout Mode. That means 50% chance of a successful breakout in either direction, and a 50% chance that the 1<sup>st</sup>breakout attempt will fail.<li>Every trading range always has both buy and sell signals.<li>Yesterday was the entry bar for Wednesday’s small double bottom buy signal. The bulls hope it is a base that will lead to a reversal up.<li>However, the bulls need bigger bars and a couple closes far above the trading range before traders conclude that a bull trend has begun. Yesterday was a small bull bar with a prominent tail on top and today so far is a small doji inside bar.<li>The bears hope the month-long trading range is a bear flag and will lead to another leg down. They want a reversal down today or Monday for another attempt at a double top. This time, with the December 8 high.<li>Whether or not there is a new low and a test of the June 19, 2020 higher low, traders should expect a rally for at least a couple months to begin here or from a little lower.<li>The EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years. The current leg down has lasted a year, which is a long time. Traders should expect a bounce soon.<li>Currency reversals are more common at the start of the year. The current bear trend began on January 6 of this year. Traders should be ready for a possible reversal up in early January.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down to last year’s low without a rally of at least for a couple months.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially at the end of the day. So far, this week is the 4<sup>th</sup>consecutive doji bar on the weekly chart.<li>The more the week closes on the high and the bigger the bull body, the more likely next week will be high.<li>If there is a bear body, the bigger it is, the more likely next week will trade lower.<li>Most likely, the body will remain small and traders will try again next week for a breakout.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-major-bull-and-bear-surprises-at-50-day-EMA-and-4600-big-round-number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini major bull and bear surprises at 50-day EMA and 4600 big round number\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>The Emini gapped down and sold off to the 50-day MA and to below the FOMC low, the 4600 Big Round Number, and the earlier low of the week.<li>It then reversed up violently in a Major Bull Surprise to test the 60-minute EMA and the midpoint of the week. A Major Bull Surprise makes a bear trend day unlikely.<li>Extreme buy climaxes like that typically lead to trading ranges, and this one did as well.<li>However, the selloff from the high was greater than what was likely. It was a Major Bear Surprise, which made a bull trend day unlikely.<li>With a bear trend and a bull trend both unlikely, traders got a trading range. The trading range centered around the open of the day and the middle of the day’s range.<li>On the daily chart, today formed a lower low double bottom with Tuesday’s low. It is a bear follow-through bar after yesterday’s big bear bar.<li>However, it closed above Tuesday’s low and the selloff is not yet as strongly bearish as it could be. Because it was a bear doji bar, it is fairly neutral. It is not a high probability High 1 buy signal bar for Monday.<li>The odds still slightly favor a new high by the end of the year and possibly above 4800. However, if the bulls do not start to get bull bars closing near their highs next week, the Emini will probably not make a new high this year. Instead, it might trade down to the December low.<li>On the weekly chart, today closed near its low. It is a sell signal bar for a micro double top with the high of 4 weeks ago.<li>However, the bull trend has been strong and the weekly chart has been sideways for 7 weeks. This is not a high probability sell setup. The odds favor more sideways trading next week.<li>Traders might be waiting for the last week of the year before deciding if the year will close at a new high, at the December low, or in the middle.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, it followed 3 weeks of doji bars and reduces the chance that the EURUSD going far below it without another pullback.<li>Since this week is a bear bar closing near the low, it is a strong bear entry bar. That increases the chance of at least slightly lower prices next week. It may test below the June 19th, 2020, higher low.<li>The bears want a strong break below the June 19th, 2020, higher low and a continuation of the measured move down which began in October.&nbsp;<li>For now, if there is a break below the 4-week trading range, odds are it might be the final flag of the bear leg.<li>The bulls want next week to reverse up and become a buy signal bar. They want these four sideways bars to be a base after the two big bear bars in early November. They want those two bars to be an exhaustive end of the yearlong selloff.&nbsp;<li>However, they need to get big bull bars closing on their highs and closing far above the top of the four-week tight trading range before traders will conclude that a bull trend has begun.<li>Al has been saying for a few weeks that there should be a sideways to up move lasting at least a couple of months starting from where the EURUSD is now or from slightly lower. The EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/how-to-trade-manual/trading-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trading range</a>. Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>Al has also said that currencies have an increased chance of reversing in early January. The current bear trend began on January 6<sup>th</sup>of this year. The bears hope that the yearlong bear trend is a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008. More likely, the seven-year trading range will continue.<li>The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>A couple of months of sideways to up trading is likely before there is a breakout below the bottom of the 7-year range, if there is going to be a breakout below the bottom before a breakout above the top.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Daily-Weak-Pullback-Wedge-Bear-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-19-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily chart - Weak pullback and wedge bear flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>The daily chart has been in a very tight trading range for a month. Every trading range has double tops and double bottoms. It is a breakout mode situation.<li>That means there is about 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout.<li>It also means that there’s a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse.<li>Because the tight trading range is coming in a bear trend, even though the market is in breakout mode, it’s slightly more likely that there will be a bear breakout. This is especially true with this week closing near its low.<li>The bears see the tight trading range as a wedge bear flag (November 18, November 30 and December 16 or November 30, December 8 and December 16) and want a continuation of the measured move lower.<li>They see the move down from November 10 to November 24 low as the first leg down and want a breakout from the wedge bear flag to form a second sideways to down leg.<li>However, the tight trading range may be the final bear flag followed by a reversal up probably from around June 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020, low and around early January.<li>Al has been saying that because the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years, the odds of more reversals are greater than those of a breakout of the 7-year range.&nbsp;<li>The current leg down has lasted a year.

When December went below the November low, it triggered a Low 1 to sell signal. That sell signal is in effect unless the market goes above the November high.<li>With the bull trend as strong as it has been, and with December not selling off sharply and far below the November low, the bulls have at least a 50% chance that the market will not continue down, without first going above the November high.<li>It could go above the November high in December or in January.<li>If it goes above the November high in December, December will be an outside up month, like we had in October.<li>However, it would be the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October. Therefore, a reversal down after a new high would be from a micro wedge. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down. The target would be the bottom of the outside bar in October.<li>Remember there was an OO buy signal when November went above the October high. November was a bear bar and therefore a sell signal for a failed breakout above the OO pattern. However, there has not been follow-through selling in December.<li>There is still time for December to close on its low and far below the November low.

However, since the bull trend is strong and the Emini has been in a tight trading range for 7 weeks, it is a less reliable sell setup. The bears will need to create follow-through selling next week to convince traders that a deeper pullback may be developing.<li>Al said that last week’s bull bar followed two consecutive bear bars which reduce the chance of the Emini going far above it without another pullback. This week was another pullback.<li>Next week will probably have to go below this week’s low to see if there are more sellers there. If next week is also a big bear bar, there would be a 50% chance that the selloff would continue down to the October low before the bulls get a new high.<li>If next week is a bull bar closing above its midpoint, the bulls will try to get a new all-time high in the final week of the year.<li>Traders might be waiting for the final week of the year before they decide whether the year will close at a new all-time high or close near the December low.<li>The Emini has been sideways for seven weeks. That is a tight trading range and a breakout mode pattern. Because it’s in a bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout, even if next week breaks a little below this week’s low.<li>However, a tight trading range late in a bull trend is usually a final bull flag. Therefore, if the market does go up over the next several weeks, it probably will not go up very far before there is a reversal down to the bottom of the bull flag, which is the December low.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>The odds favor more sideways trading next week.&nbsp;</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Daily-Weak-Follow-Through-Testing-Trend-Extreme.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-19-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini daily chart weak follow through testing trend extreme\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini traded sideways to down for the week. Friday was a bear doji candlestick.<li>The bulls want a reversal up from a double bottom with Tuesday’s low at the 50-day moving average. The low is also about a 50% retracement of the December rally.<li>The bulls want the bull trend to resume and for December to close at a new all-time high. That would be above the November high, and it would turn December into an outside up bar on the monthly chart.<li>The bears, however, are hoping that Thursday’s big sell-off formed a double top with last Friday’s high and a bigger double top with the November 22<sup>nd</sup>all-time high.<li>So far, the follow-through selling after Thursday’s big bear day has not been strong.<li>What happens over the next week will determine what the market will do into the end of the year.<li>If the bulls start to get bull bars, the rally will probably continue up to a new all-time high and above 4800.<li>If the market forms bear bars, the selloff will probably test the December low by the end of the month. If it does, December will be a bear bar on the monthly chart, and that would increase the chances of January trading lower.<li>The December rally is the third leg up. The first leg up began in October, the second leg up began on December 3<sup>rd</sup>.<li>This will probably result in profit-taking and a test of the October low at some point in the next several months.<li>If the Emini fails to make a new high, then the reversal will be from a double top with the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high.<li>If the Emini does make a new high and then reverses down in January, there would be a wedge top where the first leg up was September 2<sup>nd</sup>and the second leg up was November 22<sup>nd</sup>. Again, the target would be the October 4<sup>th</sup>low, which is the start of the wedge rally.<li>With the market being sideways for a couple of weeks, traders have still not yet decided whether to continue up to a new all-time high or reverse down.<li>But with the bull trend as strong as it has been, it is more likely that the bulls will succeed in getting a new high this year.<li>If they do the market will probably go above 4800 by the end of the year.</ul><h2 id=\"9-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, it followed 3 weeks of doji bars and reduces the chance that the EURUSD going far below it without another pullback.<li>Since this week is a bear bar closing near the low, it is a strong bear entry bar. That increases the chance of at least slightly lower prices next week. It may test below the June 19th, 2020, higher low.<li>The bears want a strong break below the June 19th, 2020, higher low and a continuation of the measured move down which began in October.&nbsp;<li>For now, if there is a break below the 4-week trading range, odds are it might be the final flag of the bear leg.<li>The bulls want next week to reverse up and become a buy signal bar. They want these four sideways bars to be a base after the two big bear bars in early November. They want those two bars to be an exhaustive end of the yearlong selloff.&nbsp;<li>However, they need to get big bull bars closing on their highs and closing far above the top of the four-week tight trading range before traders will conclude that a bull trend has begun.<li>Al has been saying for a few weeks that there should be a sideways to up move lasting at least a couple of months starting from where the EURUSD is now or from slightly lower. The EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/how-to-trade-manual/trading-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trading range</a>. Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>Al has also said that currencies have an increased chance of reversing in early January. The current bear trend began on January 6<sup>th</sup>of this year. The bears hope that the yearlong bear trend is a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008. More likely, the seven-year trading range will continue.<li>The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>A couple of months of sideways to up trading is likely before there is a breakout below the bottom of the 7-year range, if there is going to be a breakout below the bottom before a breakout above the top.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Daily-Weak-Pullback-Wedge-Bear-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-19-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily chart - Weak pullback and wedge bear flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>The daily chart has been in a very tight trading range for a month. Every trading range has double tops and double bottoms. It is a breakout mode situation.<li>That means there is about 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout.<li>It also means that there’s a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse.<li>Because the tight trading range is coming in a bear trend, even though the market is in breakout mode, it’s slightly more likely that there will be a bear breakout. This is especially true with this week closing near its low.<li>The bears see the tight trading range as a wedge bear flag (November 18, November 30 and December 16 or November 30, December 8 and December 16) and want a continuation of the measured move lower.<li>They see the move down from November 10 to November 24 low as the first leg down and want a breakout from the wedge bear flag to form a second sideways to down leg.<li>However, the tight trading range may be the final bear flag followed by a reversal up probably from around June 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020, low and around early January.<li>Al has been saying that because the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years, the odds of more reversals are greater than those of a breakout of the 7-year range.&nbsp;<li>The current leg down has lasted a year. While it could last longer, it will probably reverse up for at least a couple of months before breaking below last year’s low and the 2017 low at the bottom of the 7-year range.<li>There’s only a 30% chance that the small pullback bear trend will continue down to last year’s low without at least a rally lasting a couple of months or more.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Monthly-Dec-Doji-Bar-At-Top-of-Trend-Channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-19-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly chart - December Doji bar at top of trend channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>The December monthly Emini candlestick currently is a doji bar. When December went below the November low, it triggered a Low 1 to sell signal. That sell signal is in effect unless the market goes above the November high.<li>With the bull trend as strong as it has been, and with December not selling off sharply and far below the November low, the bulls have at least a 50% chance that the market will not continue down, without first going above the November high.<li>It could go above the November high in December or in January.<li>If it goes above the November high in December, December will be an outside up month, like we had in October.<li>However, it would be the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October. Therefore, a reversal down after a new high would be from a micro wedge. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down. The target would be the bottom of the outside bar in October.<li>Remember there was an OO buy signal when November went above the October high. November was a bear bar and therefore a sell signal for a failed breakout above the OO pattern. However, there has not been follow-through selling in December.<li>There is still time for December to close on its low and far below the November low. There is also time for December to close above the November high and form an outside up month.<li>With December currently in the middle of the month’s range and around the open of the month,<a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/history-says-december-could-be-choppy-after-historic-monthly-stock-market-gain-11606763276\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">traders have not yet decided what to do</a>with the close of the month.<li>If the close remains around the open, that increases the chances of more sideways trading in January.<li>The odds continue to slightly favor a new all-time high in December or January.<li>However, there will also probably be a reversal down either starting in December or in January.<li>Because the bull trend is so strong, if there is a reversal down, it probably will be minor, which means it’ll probably last a month or two and not continue straight down into a bear trend.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Weekly-Bear-Bar-After-Testing-Trend-Extreme.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-19-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly chart bear bar after testing trend extreme.

However, since the bull trend is strong and the Emini has been in a tight trading range for 7 weeks, it is a less reliable sell setup. The bears will need to create follow-through selling next week to convince traders that a deeper pullback may be developing.<li>Al said that last week’s bull bar followed two consecutive bear bars which reduce the chance of the Emini going far above it without another pullback. This week was another pullback.<li>Next week will probably have to go below this week’s low to see if there are more sellers there. If next week is also a big bear bar, there would be a 50% chance that the selloff would continue down to the October low before the bulls get a new high.<li>If next week is a bull bar closing above its midpoint, the bulls will try to get a new all-time high in the final week of the year.<li>Traders might be waiting for the final week of the year before they decide whether the year will close at a new all-time high or close near the December low.<li>The Emini has been sideways for seven weeks. That is a tight trading range and a breakout mode pattern. Because it’s in a bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout, even if next week breaks a little below this week’s low.<li>However, a tight trading range late in a bull trend is usually a final bull flag. Therefore, if the market does go up over the next several weeks, it probably will not go up very far before there is a reversal down to the bottom of the bull flag, which is the December low.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>The odds favor more sideways trading next week.&nbsp;</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Daily-Weak-Follow-Through-Testing-Trend-Extreme.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-19-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini daily chart weak follow through testing trend extreme\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini traded sideways to down for the week. Friday was a bear doji candlestick.<li>The bulls want a reversal up from a double bottom with Tuesday’s low at the 50-day moving average. The low is also about a 50% retracement of the December rally.<li>The bulls want the bull trend to resume and for December to close at a new all-time high. That would be above the November high, and it would turn December into an outside up bar on the monthly chart.<li>The bears, however, are hoping that Thursday’s big sell-off formed a double top with last Friday’s high and a bigger double top with the November 22<sup>nd</sup>all-time high.<li>So far, the follow-through selling after Thursday’s big bear day has not been strong.<li>What happens over the next week will determine what the market will do into the end of the year.<li>If the bulls start to get bull bars, the rally will probably continue up to a new all-time high and above 4800.<li>If the market forms bear bars, the selloff will probably test the December low by the end of the month. If it does, December will be a bear bar on the monthly chart, and that would increase the chances of January trading lower.<li>The December rally is the third leg up. The first leg up began in October, the second leg up began on December 3<sup>rd</sup>.<li>This will probably result in profit-taking and a test of the October low at some point in the next several months.<li>If the Emini fails to make a new high, then the reversal will be from a double top with the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high.<li>If the Emini does make a new high and then reverses down in January, there would be a wedge top where the first leg up was September 2<sup>nd</sup>and the second leg up was November 22<sup>nd</sup>. Again, the target would be the October 4<sup>th</sup>low, which is the start of the wedge rally.<li>With the market being sideways for a couple of weeks, traders have still not yet decided whether to continue up to a new all-time high or reverse down.<li>But with the bull trend as strong as it has been, it is more likely that the bulls will succeed in getting a new high this year.<li>If they do the market will probably go above 4800 by the end of the year.</ul><h2 id=\"9-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was also a test of the 4500 Big Round Number.<li>Bulls hope this is start of rally with new high before year end.<li>Bears hope this is 2-day pullback in reversal down from double top (Nov 22/Dec 16).<li>Bears want reversal back down from 20-day EMA and 50% pullback of selloff from Dec 16 high.<li>If there is a reversal from a lower high, the trading range will be a triangle where Nov 22 is the 1st high.<li>Trading range for 7 weeks so Breakout Mode, which means the probability of a successful bull breakout is about the same as for a successful bear breakout.<li>I have been saying that odds slightly favor a bull breakout to a new high either in December or early 2022.<li>However, if the bears get consecutive closes below December 3 low (neckline of double top), odds will shift in favor of measured move down and test of October low.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 5 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day. It ended with a potential expanding triangle over the final 2 hours.<li>Since yesterday was a buy climax day, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading today starting by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>With all of the abrupt reversals over the past month, traders should not be surprised if today is a big bear day, despite yesterday being a big bull day.<li>If today is a bear day, the daily chart will be in a triangle. That would make the chart back to around 50-50 (it is currently slightly more bullish).<li>If the bulls are going to close the year at a new high, there probably will be mostly bull days for the remainder of the year. That means if the Emini is below the open in the final hour, traders should be ready for a rally back above the open.<li>If the Emini begins to form mostly bull days, that will increase the chance that the next day will be another bull day.<li>The more bear days over the next few days, the less likely the Emini will make a new high this year.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-wedge-and-High-2-bottom-at-EMA-then-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-22.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge and High 2 bottom at EMA then small pullback bull trend.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Forex-in-middle-of-4-week-tight-trading-range-in-bear-trend-so-possibe-Final-Bear-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-22-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex in middle of 4 week tight trading range in bear trend so possibe Final Bear Flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>Today so far is a small bull day.<li>The EURUSD is in the middle of a 4-week tight trading range, so Breakout Mode.

They have a 30% chance of achieving that before there is at least a 2-month rally.<li>Bulls want 4-week tight trading range to be a base that leads to a rally back up to the middle of the 2021 bear trend. They need consecutive bull bars closing near their highs and above the November 30 high at the top of the 4-week tight trading range.<li>If there is a bear breakout, it will probably fail within a few weeks and reverse up. Tight trading range late in bear trend is usually Final Bear Flag.<li>Might reverse up from double bottom with June 19, 2020 low (weekly chart, not shown) and a measured move down based on height of 4-week tight trading range.<li>In middle of 7-year trading range. Legs in trading ranges are often strong, but do not typically go from top to bottom without a bounce. That is why a 2-month rally is likely before the selloff breaks below the bottom of the 7-year trading range.<li>Traders should expect a 2-month rally to begin soon, either from the current 4-week tight trading range or from a reversal up from a break below the the range (which would then be the Final Bear Flag).<li>Currency reversals have an increased chance of happening at the start of a year.

It was also a test of the 4500 Big Round Number.<li>Bulls hope this is start of rally with new high before year end.<li>Bears hope this is 2-day pullback in reversal down from double top (Nov 22/Dec 16).<li>Bears want reversal back down from 20-day EMA and 50% pullback of selloff from Dec 16 high.<li>If there is a reversal from a lower high, the trading range will be a triangle where Nov 22 is the 1st high.<li>Trading range for 7 weeks so Breakout Mode, which means the probability of a successful bull breakout is about the same as for a successful bear breakout.<li>I have been saying that odds slightly favor a bull breakout to a new high either in December or early 2022.<li>However, if the bears get consecutive closes below December 3 low (neckline of double top), odds will shift in favor of measured move down and test of October low.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 5 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day. It ended with a potential expanding triangle over the final 2 hours.<li>Since yesterday was a buy climax day, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading today starting by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>With all of the abrupt reversals over the past month, traders should not be surprised if today is a big bear day, despite yesterday being a big bull day.<li>If today is a bear day, the daily chart will be in a triangle. That would make the chart back to around 50-50 (it is currently slightly more bullish).<li>If the bulls are going to close the year at a new high, there probably will be mostly bull days for the remainder of the year. That means if the Emini is below the open in the final hour, traders should be ready for a rally back above the open.<li>If the Emini begins to form mostly bull days, that will increase the chance that the next day will be another bull day.<li>The more bear days over the next few days, the less likely the Emini will make a new high this year.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-wedge-and-High-2-bottom-at-EMA-then-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-22.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge and High 2 bottom at EMA then small pullback bull trend. Bulls want rally to new high before year end.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Forex-in-middle-of-4-week-tight-trading-range-in-bear-trend-so-possibe-Final-Bear-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-22-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex in middle of 4 week tight trading range in bear trend so possibe Final Bear Flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>Today so far is a small bull day.<li>The EURUSD is in the middle of a 4-week tight trading range, so Breakout Mode. Since yearlong bear trend, bear breakout is slightly more likely.<li>Bears want bear breakout and resumption of yearlong bear trend. They then want a measured move down.<li>Next target for the bears is June 19, 2020 higher low, which was 1<sup>st</sup>pullback in last year’s strong rally.<li>Bears then want trend to continue down to below bottom of 7-year trading range. They have a 30% chance of achieving that before there is at least a 2-month rally.<li>Bulls want 4-week tight trading range to be a base that leads to a rally back up to the middle of the 2021 bear trend. They need consecutive bull bars closing near their highs and above the November 30 high at the top of the 4-week tight trading range.<li>If there is a bear breakout, it will probably fail within a few weeks and reverse up. Tight trading range late in bear trend is usually Final Bear Flag.<li>Might reverse up from double bottom with June 19, 2020 low (weekly chart, not shown) and a measured move down based on height of 4-week tight trading range.<li>In middle of 7-year trading range. Legs in trading ranges are often strong, but do not typically go from top to bottom without a bounce. That is why a 2-month rally is likely before the selloff breaks below the bottom of the 7-year trading range.<li>Traders should expect a 2-month rally to begin soon, either from the current 4-week tight trading range or from a reversal up from a break below the the range (which would then be the Final Bear Flag).<li>Currency reversals have an increased chance of happening at the start of a year. The current bear trend began on January 6.

This week’s candlestick is a bull signal bar for next week. The bulls need follow-through buying next week and a strong breakout above the tight trading range. They need to create consecutive bull bars with closes far above the top of the 5-week tight trading range before traders will conclude that a bull trend has begun.

If there is a break below the 5-week trading range, odds are it might be the final flag of the bear leg.&nbsp;<li>Since this week is a bull bar, it is a weak sell signal bar for the bears. It reduces the chance that the EURUSD going far below it without another pullback.<li>The current tight trading range is an area of balance between the bulls and bears.<li>The bulls want follow-through buying next week and a strong breakout above the tight trading range.

They want those two bars to be an exhaustive end of the yearlong selloff.&nbsp;<li>Al has been saying for a few weeks that there should be a sideways to up move lasting at least a couple of months starting from where the EURUSD is now or from slightly lower. The EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/how-to-trade-manual/trading-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trading range</a>. Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>Al has also said that currencies have an increased chance of reversing in early January. The current bear trend began on January 6<sup>th</sup>of this year. The bears hope that the yearlong bear trend is a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008. More likely, the seven-year trading range will continue.<li>The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>A couple of months of sideways to up trading is likely before there is a breakout below the bottom of the 7-year range if there is going to be a breakout below the bottom.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Daily-No-Bear-Breakout-Below-Wedge-Bear-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-26-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Daily chart - No Bear Breakout below Wedge Bear Flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>The daily chart has been in a very tight trading range for 5 weeks. It is a breakout mode situation.<li>That means there is about 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout.<li>It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse.<li>Because the tight trading range is coming in a bear trend, even though the market is in breakout mode, it’s slightly more likely that there will be a bear breakout.&nbsp;<li>However, if there is a bear breakout, the tight trading range may be the final bear flag followed by a reversal up within a few weeks and then the start of a rally that lasts at least a couple of months probably from around June 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020 low.&nbsp;<li>Al has been saying that trend reversals in the currency have an increased chance of happening in January. The current bear trend on the daily chart began on January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2021. Traders might be waiting for January before they begin a reversal up.<li>Al has been saying that because the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years, the odds of more reversals are greater than those of a breakout of the 7-year range.&nbsp;<li>The current leg down has lasted a year. While it could last longer, it will probably reverse up for at least a couple of months before breaking below last year’s low and the 2017 low at the bottom of the 7-year range.<li>There’s only a 30% chance that the small pullback bear trend will continue down to last year’s low without at least a rally lasting a couple of months or more.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Monthly-Dec-Bull-Bar-Trading-Near-All-Time-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-26-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart - December Bull Bar Trading Emini near All-time High\"></a></figure><ul><li>The December monthly Emini candlestick currently is a bull bar trading near all-time high with 5 trading days left for month.<li>When December went below the November low, it triggered a Low 1 sell signal. That sell signal is in effect unless the market goes above the November high. If December remains below November, it will increase the chances of lower prices in January especially if there is a large tail above or a bear body.<li>With 5 more trading days left for December, the November high is within reach next week. A single strong bull trend day is enough to reach it. If December is an outside up month on the monthly chart, it would increase the chances of higher prices in January.&nbsp;<li>However, it would be the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October therefore a micro wedge. Since the bull trend is extreme, traders are looking for reasons to take some profits. A micro wedge is often a trigger for profit-taking. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down.&nbsp;<li>The target would be the bottom of the outside bar in October. The bears would like to break below that and drive the market down for a measured move. However, it’s more likely that there will be a bounce from that from a double bottom if the market gets there in the next few months.<li>If instead the December close is near the high but does not go above the November high, it would then be a high 1 buy signal for January. Odds will then slightly favor a test above December high to see if there are more buyers or sellers above.<li>Less likely, December will have a bear body. So, next week is important as it will influence how traders behave in early January.<li>Can this rally continue up throughout 2022? That is less likely. It is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a five or six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down possibly from a micro double top.<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months and not continue straight down into a bear trend. Even if it sells off for 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Weekly-Double-Bottom-Bull-Flag-Near-All-Time-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-26-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart - Double Bottom Bull Flag near All-time High\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was an outside bull bar closing near the high. It traded below last week’s low to test the bull trend line and reversed up from a double bottom bull flag with Dec 3 low.<li>This week is a bull signal bar for next week. Next week may even gap up on the weekly chart to an all-time high.<li>The past 8 weeks have been a tight trading range. A trading range late in a trend often is a final bull flag. Therefore, a rally from here may fail within 3- to 5-week, possibly at the top of the bull channel and possibly around the 5000 big round Number.<li>Therefore, if the market does go up over the next several weeks, it probably will not go up very far before there is a reversal down to the bottom of the bull flag, which is the December low.<li>A tight trading range is a breakout mode pattern and has a 50-50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout. It also has a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse within a couple of bars. Because it’s in a strong bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>The bears want a double top with November 22, even if the Emini makes a new high first. They want any breakout above the tight trading range to fail and then a test of the December low followed by a measured move down which will take them to the Oct low.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create follow-through selling and consecutive bear bars closing near their lows. They need to do more to convince traders that a deeper pullback may be developing.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to up slightly more.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Daily-Double-Bottom-Bull-Flag-Testing-All-Time-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-26-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart - Double Bottom Bull Flag Testing All-time-High\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week reversed up strongly from a test of the bottom of the bull channel and the 100-day moving average. It formed a higher low double bottom bull flag with the December 3 low. The rally up has been strong enough for traders to expect at least a small second leg sideways to up.<li>The bulls want the bull trend to resume and for December to close at a new all-time high. That would be above the November high, and it would turn December into an outside up bar on the monthly chart.<li>The bears are hoping that this week’s strong rally was simply a buy vacuum test of the 8-week tight trading range high. They want a micro double top with December 16, and a larger wedge top with November 22.<li>They then want a close below December 3 low by the end of the month. If it does, December will be a bear bar on the monthly chart, and that would increase the chances of January trading lower.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create consecutive strong bear bars closing near their lows. Every pullback has been bought by the bulls since the pandemic crash.<li>If there is some profit-taking over the next few days, it probably will only be minor. The odds are that the Emini is going to make a new all-time high within the next few weeks.<li>There is better than a 50% chance that it will make a new high next week. That is true even if it pulls back for a couple of days early in the week.<li>Al said that the bulls want the year to end at the high. That would be a statement of how strong the bulls have been over the past two years period with the last trading day of the year also being the last day of the week, and the last day of the month. If December were to close at the high, and then if January gapped up to a new all-time high, there would be a gap up on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. That probably has never happened in the history of the stock market.<li>However, if there is a gap up traders will be looking for a possible reversal down from a new high and from the top of the channel drawn from the September 2<sup>nd</sup>high to the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high.<li>There would be 3 pushes up and a reversal at that point would be from a wedge which often attracts profit takers and would probably lead to a couple of legs sideways to down lasting a few months.<li>The bears will try to break below the December low which is a neckline of a double top with the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high and with whatever high we get over the next few weeks.<li>Bears then want a measured move down from below that December 3<sup>rd</sup>low which would take them down to the October 3<sup>rd</sup>low which was the start of the wedge rally and which is a common magnet after a wedge reversal.<li>Can the bull trend continue straight up for a measured move based upon the height of the two-month trading range which would take them to around 5000?<li>There is always such a possibility. It would then be a parabolic buy climax and odds of profit-taking would increase after that.<li>More likely, traders will either take profits around the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high which would create a double top or more likely from above the November high which would create a wedge top with the September 2<sup>nd</sup>high and the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high.<li>Therefore, there probably will be at least a couple of months of profit-taking starting sometime early next year.<li>Al has said that before any bar closes on any timeframe, there is often a very sharp move in either direction which changes the appearance of that bar. Right now, the yearly chart (not shown) is a big bull bar closing on its high. If December were to sell off strongly in the final week of the year, the yearly chart would not be nearly as strong and will have a prominent tail on top.

Bulls want month to close near the high and above November high which would result in an outside bull bar. If that happens, it increases the odds of a gap up on the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly chart on January 3<sup>rd</sup>which may not have happened before in history. Bears hope for a double top with November 22<sup>nd</sup>or a wedge top if the Emini rallies for a few weeks.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex is in a 5-week tight trading range. This week’s candlestick is a bull signal bar for next week. The bulls need follow-through buying next week and a strong breakout above the tight trading range. They need to create consecutive bull bars with closes far above the top of the 5-week tight trading range before traders will conclude that a bull trend has begun. If there is a bear breakout, the tight trading range likely is the final bear flag before a reversal lasting a couple of months begins.<h2 id=\"2-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"3-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Weekly-No-Bear-Follow-Through.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-26.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly chart - No bear follow through\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a bull inside bar closing near the upper half of the week’s range. However, it had a conspicuous tail above which means the bulls are not as strong as they could have been. It is a bull signal bar for next week.<li>The bears were not able to get follow-through selling following last week’s strong bear signal bar.<li>Bears want a breakout below the tight trading range from a double top bear flag (November 30 and December 16) and then a strong break below the June 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020 higher low followed by a continuation of the measured move down which began in October.&nbsp;<li>This week’s candlestick is the 5<sup>th</sup>consecutive sideways week on the weekly chart. If there is a break below the 5-week trading range, odds are it might be the final flag of the bear leg.&nbsp;<li>Since this week is a bull bar, it is a weak sell signal bar for the bears. It reduces the chance that the EURUSD going far below it without another pullback.<li>The current tight trading range is an area of balance between the bulls and bears.<li>The bulls want follow-through buying next week and a strong breakout above the tight trading range. They need to get big bull bars closing on their highs and closing far above the top of the five-week tight trading range before traders will conclude that a bull trend has begun.<li>Bulls want these five sideways bars to be a base after the two big bear bars in early November. They want those two bars to be an exhaustive end of the yearlong selloff.&nbsp;<li>Al has been saying for a few weeks that there should be a sideways to up move lasting at least a couple of months starting from where the EURUSD is now or from slightly lower. The EURUSD is in the middle of a 7-year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/how-to-trade-manual/trading-ranges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trading range</a>. Legs rarely go straight from the top to the bottom without some confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. This year has been clearly bearish. Clarity does not last forever in trading ranges.<li>Al has also said that currencies have an increased chance of reversing in early January. The current bear trend began on January 6<sup>th</sup>of this year. The bears hope that the yearlong bear trend is a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008. More likely, the seven-year trading range will continue.<li>The 2021 selloff is still more likely a pullback from the 2020 rally than a resumption of the bear trend that began 14 years ago.&nbsp;<li>A couple of months of sideways to up trading is likely before there is a breakout below the bottom of the 7-year range if there is going to be a breakout below the bottom.<li>There is only a 30% chance that this selloff will continue down with only brief pullbacks and then break strongly below the 7-year trading range.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EURUSD-Daily-No-Bear-Breakout-Below-Wedge-Bear-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-26-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Daily chart - No Bear Breakout below Wedge Bear Flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>The daily chart has been in a very tight trading range for 5 weeks. It is a breakout mode situation.<li>That means there is about 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout.<li>It also means that there is a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse.<li>Because the tight trading range is coming in a bear trend, even though the market is in breakout mode, it’s slightly more likely that there will be a bear breakout.&nbsp;<li>However, if there is a bear breakout, the tight trading range may be the final bear flag followed by a reversal up within a few weeks and then the start of a rally that lasts at least a couple of months probably from around June 19<sup>th</sup>, 2020 low.&nbsp;<li>Al has been saying that trend reversals in the currency have an increased chance of happening in January. The current bear trend on the daily chart began on January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2021. Traders might be waiting for January before they begin a reversal up.<li>Al has been saying that because the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years, the odds of more reversals are greater than those of a breakout of the 7-year range.&nbsp;<li>The current leg down has lasted a year. While it could last longer, it will probably reverse up for at least a couple of months before breaking below last year’s low and the 2017 low at the bottom of the 7-year range.<li>There’s only a 30% chance that the small pullback bear trend will continue down to last year’s low without at least a rally lasting a couple of months or more.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Monthly-Dec-Bull-Bar-Trading-Near-All-Time-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-26-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart - December Bull Bar Trading Emini near All-time High\"></a></figure><ul><li>The December monthly Emini candlestick currently is a bull bar trading near all-time high with 5 trading days left for month.<li>When December went below the November low, it triggered a Low 1 sell signal. That sell signal is in effect unless the market goes above the November high. If December remains below November, it will increase the chances of lower prices in January especially if there is a large tail above or a bear body.<li>With 5 more trading days left for December, the November high is within reach next week. A single strong bull trend day is enough to reach it. If December is an outside up month on the monthly chart, it would increase the chances of higher prices in January.&nbsp;<li>However, it would be the third leg up where the first legs up were August and October therefore a micro wedge. Since the bull trend is extreme, traders are looking for reasons to take some profits. A micro wedge is often a trigger for profit-taking. That would probably lead to a couple of bars sideways to down.&nbsp;<li>The target would be the bottom of the outside bar in October. The bears would like to break below that and drive the market down for a measured move. However, it’s more likely that there will be a bounce from that from a double bottom if the market gets there in the next few months.<li>If instead the December close is near the high but does not go above the November high, it would then be a high 1 buy signal for January. Odds will then slightly favor a test above December high to see if there are more buyers or sellers above.<li>Less likely, December will have a bear body. So, next week is important as it will influence how traders behave in early January.<li>Can this rally continue up throughout 2022? That is less likely. It is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming.<li>Therefore, the bull trend will probably transition into a trading range for at least a couple of months.<li>For example, if the market were to get down to the October low, then the trading range would have begun in August and there would be a five or six- or seven-month trading range on the monthly chart.<li>At that point, the bulls will try to get a resumption up and the bears will try to get a bigger reversal down possibly from a micro double top.<li>Al has said that the bull trend from the pandemic crash has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months and not continue straight down into a bear trend. Even if it sells off for 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Weekly-Double-Bottom-Bull-Flag-Near-All-Time-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-26-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart - Double Bottom Bull Flag near All-time High\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was an outside bull bar closing near the high. It traded below last week’s low to test the bull trend line and reversed up from a double bottom bull flag with Dec 3 low.<li>This week is a bull signal bar for next week. Next week may even gap up on the weekly chart to an all-time high.<li>The past 8 weeks have been a tight trading range. A trading range late in a trend often is a final bull flag. Therefore, a rally from here may fail within 3- to 5-week, possibly at the top of the bull channel and possibly around the 5000 big round Number.<li>Therefore, if the market does go up over the next several weeks, it probably will not go up very far before there is a reversal down to the bottom of the bull flag, which is the December low.<li>A tight trading range is a breakout mode pattern and has a 50-50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout. It also has a 50% chance that the first breakout up or down will fail and reverse within a couple of bars. Because it’s in a strong bull trend, a bull breakout is slightly more likely than a bear breakout.&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>The bears want a double top with November 22, even if the Emini makes a new high first. They want any breakout above the tight trading range to fail and then a test of the December low followed by a measured move down which will take them to the Oct low.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create follow-through selling and consecutive bear bars closing near their lows. They need to do more to convince traders that a deeper pullback may be developing.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September in 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to up slightly more.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Emini-Daily-Double-Bottom-Bull-Flag-Testing-All-Time-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-12-26-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart - Double Bottom Bull Flag Testing All-time-High\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week reversed up strongly from a test of the bottom of the bull channel and the 100-day moving average. It formed a higher low double bottom bull flag with the December 3 low. The rally up has been strong enough for traders to expect at least a small second leg sideways to up.<li>The bulls want the bull trend to resume and for December to close at a new all-time high. That would be above the November high, and it would turn December into an outside up bar on the monthly chart.<li>The bears are hoping that this week’s strong rally was simply a buy vacuum test of the 8-week tight trading range high. They want a micro double top with December 16, and a larger wedge top with November 22.<li>They then want a close below December 3 low by the end of the month. If it does, December will be a bear bar on the monthly chart, and that would increase the chances of January trading lower.<li>However, the bears have not been able to create consecutive strong bear bars closing near their lows. Every pullback has been bought by the bulls since the pandemic crash.<li>If there is some profit-taking over the next few days, it probably will only be minor. The odds are that the Emini is going to make a new all-time high within the next few weeks.<li>There is better than a 50% chance that it will make a new high next week. That is true even if it pulls back for a couple of days early in the week.<li>Al said that the bulls want the year to end at the high. That would be a statement of how strong the bulls have been over the past two years period with the last trading day of the year also being the last day of the week, and the last day of the month. If December were to close at the high, and then if January gapped up to a new all-time high, there would be a gap up on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. That probably has never happened in the history of the stock market.<li>However, if there is a gap up traders will be looking for a possible reversal down from a new high and from the top of the channel drawn from the September 2<sup>nd</sup>high to the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high.<li>There would be 3 pushes up and a reversal at that point would be from a wedge which often attracts profit takers and would probably lead to a couple of legs sideways to down lasting a few months.<li>The bears will try to break below the December low which is a neckline of a double top with the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high and with whatever high we get over the next few weeks.<li>Bears then want a measured move down from below that December 3<sup>rd</sup>low which would take them down to the October 3<sup>rd</sup>low which was the start of the wedge rally and which is a common magnet after a wedge reversal.<li>Can the bull trend continue straight up for a measured move based upon the height of the two-month trading range which would take them to around 5000?<li>There is always such a possibility. It would then be a parabolic buy climax and odds of profit-taking would increase after that.<li>More likely, traders will either take profits around the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high which would create a double top or more likely from above the November high which would create a wedge top with the September 2<sup>nd</sup>high and the November 22<sup>nd</sup>high.<li>Therefore, there probably will be at least a couple of months of profit-taking starting sometime early next year.<li>Al has said that before any bar closes on any timeframe, there is often a very sharp move in either direction which changes the appearance of that bar. Right now, the yearly chart (not shown) is a big bull bar closing on its high. If December were to sell off strongly in the final week of the year, the yearly chart would not be nearly as strong and will have a prominent tail on top. Also, neither would the monthly chart.<li>So sometime right before the year closes which means sometime next week, there is the possibility for a big move in either direction. However, up is more likely than down.<li>Traders should expect a new all-time high. There is about a 50% chance that it will come next week, and that December will be an outside up month. That would result in the year closing on its high, which would increase the chances of higher prices in January.<li>It would also increase the chances of a gap up in early January.<li>But whether there is a new high or not, there should be a couple of months of profit-taking beginning within the next few months.</ul><h2 id=\"9-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
