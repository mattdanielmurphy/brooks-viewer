It was the 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal up from below the August trading range. There is now a lower low double bottom with the September 30 low. A 2-month trading range.<li>However, Friday had a big tail on top. That represents hesitation by the bulls, and it reduces the chance of a resumption of the 2021 bull trend from here.<li>Also, September was a bear bar on the monthly chart. That is probably the start of a 2- to 3-month sideways to down correction.<li>The 4-week selloff broke far below the bull channel on the weekly chart.<li>There is at least a 50% chance that the weekly Small Pullback Bull Trend has ended.<li>If so, the correction should continue down for at least 15%, which is 50% bigger than the biggest pullback in the Small Pullback Bull Trend.<li>Since the September selloff lasted a lot of bars and the Emini is trying to hold at the bottom of the August trading range, the Emini could bounce up to the September 23 lower high.<li>The bears hope that the Emini is in a bear trend. They have a 50% chance of being right. If they are, a 1- to 2-week rally from here should fail around the September 23 lower high.<li>The bears want a double top with that high. A measured move down would be around 4100.<li>A bear trend is a series of lower highs and lows. Each lower high is a failed reversal attempt. That means a bear trend typically has many strong rallies.<li>Remember, the minimum target on the weekly chart is 15%, which is around 3850. That is below the gap above the April 1 high and below the 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>On the monthly chart, the selloff should last at least 2 to 3 months. Therefore, if the high for the year is in, the Emini should fall below 4,000 this year.<li>I have been saying that there is a 50% chance that September 2 will remain the high for the year. That means there is a 50% chance of a new high.<li>But if there is a new high this year, it will probably fail to get much above the September high since the monthly buy climax is extreme and the Emini has been sideways for 3 months.<li>The bulls need to get bull bars closing near their highs and they need a strong break above the September 23 lower high before traders will conclude that the correction has ended.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 5+ points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Traders are deciding if Friday’s profit taking will be the start of a rally up to the September 23 lower high or just a pause in the September bear trend.<li>The day after a buy climax day only has a 25% chance of being another strong bull day.<li>There is a 75% chance that today will have at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>Also, the Emini is back in Wednesday and Thursday’s trading range and around the bottom of the August trading range. That further increases the chance that it could stall here for a few days.<li>Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range. The Emini might be forming a trading range since the September 20 low.<li>If today is a trading range, there should be at least one swing up and one swing down since Friday’s range was so big.</ul><h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EURUSD-Forex-reversing-up-from-sell-climax-and-expanding-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-4.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex reversing up from sell climax and expanding triangle\"></a></figure><ul><li>Expanding Triangle and failed breakout below tight bear channel.<li>Reversing up from September 29 sell climax. Traders expect at least a couple legs sideways to up to the top of the most recent sell climax, which was the big bear bar of September 29.<li>That is also above the August 20 breakout point.<li>Since at bottom of yearlong trading range after strong rally in 2020, the entire selloff is probably just a leg down in the trading range.<li>There is only a 40% chance that the selloff will continue down to last year’s low without at least a 50% retracement of the selloff from the May high. That is around the September 3 high.<li>Because the September bear channel was tight, the first leg up will probably be minor. That means that there will probably be a test back down, even if the current rally lasts a few weeks.<li>If there are several bull bars closing near their highs this week, this rally will probably last at least a couple weeks.<li>If there are bear bars closing near their lows this week, the bear trend will probably continue a little longer.<li>However, since the EURUSD is at the bottom of a yearlong trading range and the 2020 rally was stronger than the 4-month selloff, the odds are against the selloff falling much below the June 10, 2020 high at around 1.14.

The Emini turned up from a double bottom with the September 20 low and from the bottom of a 2-month Emini tight trading range. It is also reversing up from the 100-day MA and a micro double bottom with Friday’s low.<li>The bears want either a micro double top with Friday’s high or a double top with the September 23 lower high.<li>The September 23 high is just above the resistance of the 50-day MA and the big gap above the September 28 high.<li>I have been saying that the big rally in August and the big selloff in September created big confusion. Confusion typically leads to a trading range. So far, the Emini has been in a tight trading range for 4 days.<li>Traders are deciding if the Emini will reverse up from the bottom of the 3-month range or continue down to below 4,000.<li>If there is a strong break above the September 23 high, the Emini will probably make a new all-time high. However, since the Emini has been in a trading range since July, it would probably not get much above the September high before reversing down again.<li>There is a 50% chance that a 15% correction is underway. If the Emini breaks strongly below Monday’s low, which is the neckline of the micro double bottom, the odds of a test of 4,000 will be more than 50%.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 35 points in the overnight Globex session. It will therefore open near the bottom of its 4-day tight trading range.<li>The bears see today’s gap down from yesterday’s close as a reversal down from a double top with Monday’s high. That would be a micro double top on the daily chart.<li>The bulls hope that the gap down will simply be another test of the bottom of the 4-day range. A reversal up would form a 3-day triangle.<li>The 4-day trading range is 100 points tall. Traders expect a 100-point measured move up or down.<li>Trading ranges resist breaking out. Therefore, it is more likely that today will form the 5<sup>th</sup>sideways day in the tight trading range.<li>If the Emini is early in a bear trend on the daily chart (as I said, there is currently a 50% chance), then there is an increased risk of big bear surprises. That means a big bear day breaking far below support.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then trading range.

When there is a strong bear leg in a trading range, it usually will test below support.<li>Despite the 4-month bear trend, the selloff is still weaker than the 2020 rally and it has only retraced about half of that rally.<li>It is more likely a pullback from that rally and a bear leg in a 7-year trading range than a resumption of the bear trend that began in 2008.<li>The bears will need a strong break below the June 26, 2020 low before traders would expect a test of last year’s low at around 1.06.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle and trending trading range day\"></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Reversed up twice from below yesterday’s low, so High 2 bottom.<li>Big Bull Surprise Bar controlled remainder of day.

The Emini turned up from a double bottom with the September 20 low and from the bottom of a 2-month Emini tight trading range. It is also reversing up from the 100-day MA and a micro double bottom with Friday’s low.<li>The bears want either a micro double top with Friday’s high or a double top with the September 23 lower high.<li>The September 23 high is just above the resistance of the 50-day MA and the big gap above the September 28 high.<li>I have been saying that the big rally in August and the big selloff in September created big confusion. Confusion typically leads to a trading range. So far, the Emini has been in a tight trading range for 4 days.<li>Traders are deciding if the Emini will reverse up from the bottom of the 3-month range or continue down to below 4,000.<li>If there is a strong break above the September 23 high, the Emini will probably make a new all-time high. However, since the Emini has been in a trading range since July, it would probably not get much above the September high before reversing down again.<li>There is a 50% chance that a 15% correction is underway. If the Emini breaks strongly below Monday’s low, which is the neckline of the micro double bottom, the odds of a test of 4,000 will be more than 50%.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 35 points in the overnight Globex session. It will therefore open near the bottom of its 4-day tight trading range.<li>The bears see today’s gap down from yesterday’s close as a reversal down from a double top with Monday’s high. That would be a micro double top on the daily chart.<li>The bulls hope that the gap down will simply be another test of the bottom of the 4-day range. A reversal up would form a 3-day triangle.<li>The 4-day trading range is 100 points tall. Traders expect a 100-point measured move up or down.<li>Trading ranges resist breaking out. Therefore, it is more likely that today will form the 5<sup>th</sup>sideways day in the tight trading range.<li>If the Emini is early in a bear trend on the daily chart (as I said, there is currently a 50% chance), then there is an increased risk of big bear surprises. That means a big bear day breaking far below support.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then trading range. Emini tight trading range for several days now.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EURUSD-Forex-2nd-leg-down-from-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-6-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily Chart - 2nd Leg down from Bear Breakout\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday triggered a Low 1 sell signal, but it closed above Monday’s low.

If it gaps down today, yesterday will be a 1-day island top.<li>It is important to note that most island tops and bottoms are minor signals.<li>Emini reversed down yesterday selling off from just below 50-day MA and closed near its low.<li>For the bears, yesterday is a Low 2 sell signal and it formed lower high double top with the September 23 high.<li>Because it did not have a big bear body and it followed 2 strong bull days, it is a low probability sell signal, which means a minor pattern.<li>I have been saying that the Emini might form a trading range between the 50- and 100-day moving averages, and that still might be true.<li>While it reversed up from a lower low double bottom with the September 20 low, it might reverse down from a double top with the September 23 high. Most trading ranges contain at least one double top and one double bottom.<li>The Emini is in the middle of a bigger trading range that began in late July.<li>The September 23 high is important since it was a major lower high after a buy climax.<li>If the Emini breaks strongly above it, then the Emini should soon afterwards continue up to a new high. However, since the Emini has been in a trading range for almost 4 months, the breakout probably would not get far before there was another leg down.<li>If there is a strong reversal down from around that high, there would be a double top lower high major trend reversal. Because of the buy climaxes on the monthly and weekly charts, the odds would then favor a move down to below 4,000 before the end of the year.<li>After a bear bar in September on the monthly chart, there should be at least one more bear bar before the end of the year. That is what has happened with most buy climaxes over the past 10 years.<li>On the monthly chart, September was the 3<sup>rd</sup>attempt to reverse down in an 18-month strong bull trend. A third attempt typically attracts profit takers, which usually results in 2 to 3 months of sideways to down trading.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls would like this week to be an outside up bar, but last week’s high is 60 points above yesterday’s close and that might be too far to reach.<li>The bears want a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive bear bar, but the open of the week is also about 60 points away and probably out of reach.<li>This week therefore will probably be a bull bar. The bigger the body and the more it closes on its high, the stronger the buy signal bar and the more likely next week will be higher.<li>The weekly chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for more than 60 bars. Traders should expect that strong type of bull trend will eventually transition into a weaker bull trend.<li>The Small Pullback Bull Trend 1<sup>st</sup>must end. It ends once there is a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than any prior pullback in the bull trend.<li>The biggest pullback was 10% and about 378.75 points in September 2020. A 50% bigger pullback would be either 15% or about 570 points. Both would result in a move below the 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>There is currently a 50% chance that the Emini has begun a 15% correction.<li>What about the debt ceiling and the Biden’s plans? None of it matters. The institutions have already priced both in.<li>When the final news is in, whether it is good or bad, the market can go in either direction.<li>How do you know what the institutions will have concluded? Do you watch an expert on CNBC? No, because there are always about as many bulls as bears. They have a 50% chance of picking the wrong expert.<li>You simply look at the charts. If more institutional buyers think the market is cheap, given all that is known, there will be a rally. If they think it is expensive, the market will sell off. The news is never important. All that matters is how the institutions react to the news, and you can see that on the charts.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 8+ points in the overnight Globex session.<li>If the Emini does not fall below the Globex low before the day session opens, today should trade below the Globex low because the Globex low was a ledge bottom. That is 4 or more bars with identical lows in a tight trading range<li>While yesterday was a lower high in the bear channel that began on September 3, it was a weak sell signal bar. Therefore, today will probably not be a big bear day.<li>The bulls will try to keep the gap above Wednesday’s high open. Therefore, there should be buyers somewhere below yesterday’s low and above Wednesday’s high.<li>If there is a trend today, up is more likely than down.<li>Can today be a big bull day? The bulls hope that yesterday’s bear channel is a bull flag. They want to break above yesterday’s bear channel and resume the 2-day rally. Remember, the Emini will probably reach the 50-day MA soon. If today is a bull trend, that is an important magnet.<li>After several days with big moves up and down, traders might be exhausted. That increases the chance of a lot of trading range trading today.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-then-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-8.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini reversed down from 50-day MA\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It broke above yesterday’s high, making today an outside up bar, which is bullish.<li>The bulls want a reversal up from here. There would be a micro double bottom and a High 2 bottom with the October 1 high.<li>Can it continue straight down to last year’s low at around 1.06? Probably not because a selloff from a double top bear flag typically will find profit takers at around the measured move target. That usually results in at least a couple legs up.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. The bulls want a bull body on the weekly chart. This week is currently the 5th consecutive bear bar on the weekly chart. There has not been a streak of 5 consecutive bear bars in over 3 years so this week will probably have a bull body. That makes a bear trend unlikely today on the 5 minute chart.<li>The open of the week is only 13 pips above today’s current high and therefore within reach.<li>The monthly chart has been in a trading range for 7 years. There is no reason to believe it is about to end.<li>Last year broke strongly above the March 9, 2020 high of 1.1496. That is the breakout point on the monthly chart, and it is therefore important support.<li>On the weekly chart, there was an additional lower breakout point at the June 10, 2020 high of 1.1422. Since that is almost exactly at the measured move target, the selloff might dip below that as well.<li>When a market is in a trading range and it gets near support, it typically falls below support before reversing up. Consequently, this selloff should continue down to below 1.15 and possibly 1.1422, whether or not there is a bounce for a couple weeks first.<li>However, traders should then expect a rally lasting at least a few weeks and breaking at least a little above 1.1705.<li>Why? Because that is the neckline of the double top and therefore a breakout point on the way down.

Therefore, today will probably not be a big bear day.<li>The bulls will try to keep the gap above Wednesday’s high open. Therefore, there should be buyers somewhere below yesterday’s low and above Wednesday’s high.<li>If there is a trend today, up is more likely than down.<li>Can today be a big bull day? The bulls hope that yesterday’s bear channel is a bull flag. They want to break above yesterday’s bear channel and resume the 2-day rally. Remember, the Emini will probably reach the 50-day MA soon. If today is a bull trend, that is an important magnet.<li>After several days with big moves up and down, traders might be exhausted. That increases the chance of a lot of trading range trading today.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-then-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-8.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini reversed down from 50-day MA\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It broke above yesterday’s high, making today an outside up bar, which is bullish.<li>The bulls want a reversal up from here. There would be a micro double bottom and a High 2 bottom with the October 1 high.<li>Can it continue straight down to last year’s low at around 1.06? Probably not because a selloff from a double top bear flag typically will find profit takers at around the measured move target. That usually results in at least a couple legs up.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. The bulls want a bull body on the weekly chart. This week is currently the 5th consecutive bear bar on the weekly chart. There has not been a streak of 5 consecutive bear bars in over 3 years so this week will probably have a bull body. That makes a bear trend unlikely today on the 5 minute chart.<li>The open of the week is only 13 pips above today’s current high and therefore within reach.<li>The monthly chart has been in a trading range for 7 years. There is no reason to believe it is about to end.<li>Last year broke strongly above the March 9, 2020 high of 1.1496. That is the breakout point on the monthly chart, and it is therefore important support.<li>On the weekly chart, there was an additional lower breakout point at the June 10, 2020 high of 1.1422. Since that is almost exactly at the measured move target, the selloff might dip below that as well.<li>When a market is in a trading range and it gets near support, it typically falls below support before reversing up. Consequently, this selloff should continue down to below 1.15 and possibly 1.1422, whether or not there is a bounce for a couple weeks first.<li>However, traders should then expect a rally lasting at least a few weeks and breaking at least a little above 1.1705.<li>Why? Because that is the neckline of the double top and therefore a breakout point on the way down.

If it gaps down today, yesterday will be a 1-day island top.<li>It is important to note that most island tops and bottoms are minor signals.<li>Emini reversed down yesterday selling off from just below 50-day MA and closed near its low.<li>For the bears, yesterday is a Low 2 sell signal and it formed lower high double top with the September 23 high.<li>Because it did not have a big bear body and it followed 2 strong bull days, it is a low probability sell signal, which means a minor pattern.<li>I have been saying that the Emini might form a trading range between the 50- and 100-day moving averages, and that still might be true.<li>While it reversed up from a lower low double bottom with the September 20 low, it might reverse down from a double top with the September 23 high. Most trading ranges contain at least one double top and one double bottom.<li>The Emini is in the middle of a bigger trading range that began in late July.<li>The September 23 high is important since it was a major lower high after a buy climax.<li>If the Emini breaks strongly above it, then the Emini should soon afterwards continue up to a new high. However, since the Emini has been in a trading range for almost 4 months, the breakout probably would not get far before there was another leg down.<li>If there is a strong reversal down from around that high, there would be a double top lower high major trend reversal. Because of the buy climaxes on the monthly and weekly charts, the odds would then favor a move down to below 4,000 before the end of the year.<li>After a bear bar in September on the monthly chart, there should be at least one more bear bar before the end of the year. That is what has happened with most buy climaxes over the past 10 years.<li>On the monthly chart, September was the 3<sup>rd</sup>attempt to reverse down in an 18-month strong bull trend. A third attempt typically attracts profit takers, which usually results in 2 to 3 months of sideways to down trading.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls would like this week to be an outside up bar, but last week’s high is 60 points above yesterday’s close and that might be too far to reach.<li>The bears want a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive bear bar, but the open of the week is also about 60 points away and probably out of reach.<li>This week therefore will probably be a bull bar. The bigger the body and the more it closes on its high, the stronger the buy signal bar and the more likely next week will be higher.<li>The weekly chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for more than 60 bars. Traders should expect that strong type of bull trend will eventually transition into a weaker bull trend.<li>The Small Pullback Bull Trend 1<sup>st</sup>must end. It ends once there is a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than any prior pullback in the bull trend.<li>The biggest pullback was 10% and about 378.75 points in September 2020. A 50% bigger pullback would be either 15% or about 570 points. Both would result in a move below the 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>There is currently a 50% chance that the Emini has begun a 15% correction.<li>What about the debt ceiling and the Biden’s plans? None of it matters. The institutions have already priced both in.<li>When the final news is in, whether it is good or bad, the market can go in either direction.<li>How do you know what the institutions will have concluded?

This week is currently the 5th consecutive bear bar on the weekly chart. There has not been a streak of 5 consecutive bear bars in over 3 years so this week will probably have a bull body. That makes a bear trend unlikely today on the 5 minute chart.<li>The open of the week is only 13 pips above today’s current high and therefore within reach.<li>The monthly chart has been in a trading range for 7 years. There is no reason to believe it is about to end.<li>Last year broke strongly above the March 9, 2020 high of 1.1496. That is the breakout point on the monthly chart, and it is therefore important support.<li>On the weekly chart, there was an additional lower breakout point at the June 10, 2020 high of 1.1422. Since that is almost exactly at the measured move target, the selloff might dip below that as well.<li>When a market is in a trading range and it gets near support, it typically falls below support before reversing up. Consequently, this selloff should continue down to below 1.15 and possibly 1.1422, whether or not there is a bounce for a couple weeks first.<li>However, traders should then expect a rally lasting at least a few weeks and breaking at least a little above 1.1705.<li>Why? Because that is the neckline of the double top and therefore a breakout point on the way down. Remember, in a trading range, the swings typically go past support and resistance.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-trading-range-day-that-closed-near-its-low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-8-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day that closed near its low\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Began with Trading Range Open.

You can see that this is what happened with most other bear bars in prior buy climaxes.<li>The bulls will try to create a credible High 1 buy signal bar in October. But even if they do, it will probably lead to a lower high and then a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>If the bulls can get a new high before the end of the year, it will probably be brief. An extreme buy climax like this typically results in at least 2 to 3 months of sideways to down trading.<li>The bar after an outside bar often has a lot of overlap with the outside bar.&nbsp;<li>The October Emini monthly bar currently is a small bull bar with tails above and below. It is still early in the month and the monthly candlestick will look different by the close of the month.<li>At the moment, traders should expect sideways to down trading for a couple more months.</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-Weekly-Micro-Wedge-High-2-Signal-Bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-10-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Micro Wedge &amp; High 2 Signal Bar.\"></a></figure><ul><li>The weekly Emini candlestick this week was a bull bar with prominent tails above and below.<li>It broke below last week’s low but reversed higher to close with a bull body.

The bulls are not as strong as they can be.<li>Furthermore, there is a 6-bar bear microchannel, which means persistent selling.&nbsp;<li>Therefore, any pullback (bounce) from here would likely only be minor and form a lower high.&nbsp;<li>The Emini has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for more than 60 bars, which is unusual, and therefore unsustainable and climactic.<li>Traders will conclude that the Small Pullback Bull Trend has ended once there is a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than the biggest pullback in the bull trend.<li>The biggest pullback so far was the 10% selloff in September 2020. A bigger pullback typically means 15 to 20%, and that is why Al has been saying that traders should expect at least 15% correction to begin before the Emini goes above the September high.<li>The pullback could also be 50% bigger based on points instead of percent. If so, the target would be 3,850, which is below the 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>There is a 50% chance that September 2 will remain the high for the rest of 2021.<li>Since there is a 50% chance that the September 2 high will be the high of the year, there is a 50% chance that a 15% correction is underway.&nbsp;<li>A 50% chance of September 2 being the high of the year means a 50% chance there will be a new high.<li>The bulls know that most reversal attempts in a strong bull trend are minor. That means they become either bull flags or the start of a trading range.&nbsp;<li>Since this rally is so extreme, a trading range for 10 or more bars is likely to begin soon. It probably has begun.&nbsp;<li>That is true even if there is a new all-time high in the next couple of months. It will probably fail to go much above 4,600.

Small gaps typically close early in the day.<li>There have been a lot of reversals for two days.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EURUSD-Forex-tight-trading-range-in-tight-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-11-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex tight trading range in tight bear channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>2 climactic legs down below August 20 low so might get profit taking.<li>Tight trading range for 4 days in tight bear channel so small Breakout Mode pattern.<li>Today so far is a small inside day and the 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive small day.

The 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up in a tight bear channel is typically minor.<li>However, the daily chart is oversold and almost at important targets below.

Additionally, it is at a measured move down from the July 30/September 3 double top. Since there are 2 reasons to get there and the momentum down is strong, the EURUSD will probably test it as well.<li>When a market reaches a measured move below a double top bear flag, profit takers typically come in. There will probably be at least a 2-week rally from the breakout points at around 1.15 or 1.14.<li>It is important to note that this week so far is the 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive bear bar on the weekly chart. A streak of that duration has not happened in 3 years. There have not been 7 consecutive bear bars since 2014. Therefore, the weekly chart should have a bull body either this week or next week.<li>If it comes after dipping below the March 9, 2020 breakout point, it could be the start of a rally over then following few weeks.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Sold off in a sell climax on the open.

The first is the 50-day moving average (MA). The Emini is now above 50-day MA.<li>Next is the trading range that began with the September 20 low.<li>I have been saying for several weeks that the Emini would probably form a trading range between the 50-day MA and the 100-day MA.<li>Also, I said the trading range would likely have a double top around the 50-day MA and a double bottom around the 100-day.<li>There is a double bottom at the 100-day MA.<li>If the Emini stalls here for a few days and then turns down, there would be a double top at the 50-day MA.<li>As long as the Emini is in the trading range, it is in Breakout Mode. That means there is a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout.<li>When last Thursday, October 7, turned down from just below the 50-day MA, I said that traders would not consider that to be an adequate test. They wanted the rally to get above the average before turning down.<li>For the past week, I said that the Emini would rally to at least a little above the 50-day MA within a couple weeks. It closed above it yesterday, and yesterday closed on its high. The Emini should trade at least a little higher today.<li>Traders do not yet know if yesterday’s rally was a buy vacuum test of resistance or a resumption of the 18-month bull trend.<li>The bulls want a close far above the 50-day MA within the next week. It would then become support.<li>The bears want a reversal down and a close far below the 50-day MA.<li>Since yesterday went above the moving average, traders would see a strong reversal down at some point next week as a sign that the 50-day MA has become reliable resistance. It would increase the chance of lower prices.<li>If the rally reaches the all-time high and then turns down, there would be a bigger double top.<li>As for the trading range, the bulls want a measured move up above that October 7 high, which is the neckline of the September 20/October 4 double bottom. That would result in a new all-time high.<li>While yesterday’s rally was strong, the bulls need follow-through buying over the next week. That would make a test of the all-time high likely.</ul><h3>Emini weekly and monthly charts</h3><ul><li>On the weekly chart, this week went above last week’s high. But there is a 6-bar bear micro channel. That is a weak buy setup. There probably will be a lower high or a double top with the all-time high within a month and then a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down, like last year at this time.<li>Although the Emini broke below the weekly bull channel in September, the Small Pullback Bull Trend is still intact. It will end once there is a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than the biggest prior pullback in the trend. That pullback was in September and October last year.<li>Unless next week is a big bull bar on the weekly chart, there will still be a 50% chance that September 2 will be the start of that pullback.<li>On the monthly chart, September was a big outside down bar. It was the third time that there was a bear bar in the rally from the pandemic crash.<li>Look at all prior buy climaxes over the past decade. Most of the time, once there was a bear bar, there was another bear bar within a month or two. That should therefore happen this time.<li>Therefore, if there is a new high, it probably will only last a bar or two (a month or two). Traders should expect a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar on the monthly chart before the end of the year.<li>October so far is a bull bar closing near its high. If the month remains like this, it will be a High 1 buy signal bar for November. November then would probably trade above the October high.<li>September was an outside down bar. Traders should understand that the month after an outside down bar rarely is an outside up bar. That would create an OO (outside-outside) Breakout Mode Pattern. While unlikely, October could rally strongly to above the September high before the end of the month.<li>There is still a 50% chance that either November or December will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 18 points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap above yesterday’s high.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day, even though the Emini was in a trading range around the 50-day MA for the final 4 hours.<li>The day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of being sideways to down for at least 2 hours, beginning by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>Even with a couple hours of sideways to down trading, the bulls will try to create a follow-through bull trend day today. The rally would probably be a weaker type of trend, like a bull channel or a trending trading range day.<li>There might be a pullback down to the 50-day MA, but today will probably not be a big bear day after yesterday’s surprisingly strong rally to the start of a resistance zone.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. Last week’s high is a magnet below, and it is near the daily magnet of the 50-day MA. There are no other nearby major weekly targets.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-break-above-50-day-moving-average-with-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-bull-trend-from-the-open-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-15.png\" alt=\"Emini break above 50-day MA (moving average) with small pullback bull trend and bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

So far, today is a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive doji, forming a potential micro double top.<li>The bears hope it is the 2<sup>nd</sup>high in a double top with the October 4 high.<li>They want a reversal down to below the October 12 neckline, and then a measured move down.<li>The bulls hope yesterday was a pullback from Wednesday’s strong reversal up from a micro wedge bottom. They want a reversal up from below yesterday’s low and then a bull trend.<li>The EURUSD has been in a tight trading range for 2 weeks. Traders are deciding if it will reach targets below before reversing up, or if the reversal up began this week.<li>The odds still favor a dip below the March 9, 2020 high within the next few weeks. This is true even if the EURUSD rallies a little higher. That high was the breakout point for last year’s strong rally, and the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 6 years. In a trading range, when a pullback gets near support or resistance, it usually goes through it before reversing.<li>Whether or not the EURUSD dips below the March 9, 2020 high or the June 10, 2020 high (a less important breakout point), it should rally to above the August 20 low. That is the breakout point for the September selloff and therefore a magnet above.<li>Consequently, traders should expect a rally for several weeks to at least above the August 20 low and maybe to the September 3 high (July 30/September 2 double top). However, it might 1<sup>st</sup>fall to 1.14, which is the June 10, 2020 high and the measured move down from the double top.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day-and-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day and broad bull channel\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>After a gap up, the Emini entered a triangle for 3 hours.<li>As I said early in the day, today would probably have a lot of trading range trading, and if there was a bull trend, today would likely be a Trending Trading Range day.<li>Because the week closed near its high, there is an increased chance of higher prices next week.

The first is the 50-day moving average (MA). The Emini is now above 50-day MA.<li>Next is the trading range that began with the September 20 low.<li>I have been saying for several weeks that the Emini would probably form a trading range between the 50-day MA and the 100-day MA.<li>Also, I said the trading range would likely have a double top around the 50-day MA and a double bottom around the 100-day.<li>There is a double bottom at the 100-day MA.<li>If the Emini stalls here for a few days and then turns down, there would be a double top at the 50-day MA.<li>As long as the Emini is in the trading range, it is in Breakout Mode. That means there is a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout.<li>When last Thursday, October 7, turned down from just below the 50-day MA, I said that traders would not consider that to be an adequate test. They wanted the rally to get above the average before turning down.<li>For the past week, I said that the Emini would rally to at least a little above the 50-day MA within a couple weeks. It closed above it yesterday, and yesterday closed on its high. The Emini should trade at least a little higher today.<li>Traders do not yet know if yesterday’s rally was a buy vacuum test of resistance or a resumption of the 18-month bull trend.<li>The bulls want a close far above the 50-day MA within the next week. It would then become support.<li>The bears want a reversal down and a close far below the 50-day MA.<li>Since yesterday went above the moving average, traders would see a strong reversal down at some point next week as a sign that the 50-day MA has become reliable resistance. It would increase the chance of lower prices.<li>If the rally reaches the all-time high and then turns down, there would be a bigger double top.<li>As for the trading range, the bulls want a measured move up above that October 7 high, which is the neckline of the September 20/October 4 double bottom. That would result in a new all-time high.<li>While yesterday’s rally was strong, the bulls need follow-through buying over the next week. That would make a test of the all-time high likely.</ul><h3>Emini weekly and monthly charts</h3><ul><li>On the weekly chart, this week went above last week’s high. But there is a 6-bar bear micro channel. That is a weak buy setup. There probably will be a lower high or a double top with the all-time high within a month and then a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down, like last year at this time.<li>Although the Emini broke below the weekly bull channel in September, the Small Pullback Bull Trend is still intact. It will end once there is a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than the biggest prior pullback in the trend. That pullback was in September and October last year.<li>Unless next week is a big bull bar on the weekly chart, there will still be a 50% chance that September 2 will be the start of that pullback.<li>On the monthly chart, September was a big outside down bar. It was the third time that there was a bear bar in the rally from the pandemic crash.<li>Look at all prior buy climaxes over the past decade. Most of the time, once there was a bear bar, there was another bear bar within a month or two. That should therefore happen this time.<li>Therefore, if there is a new high, it probably will only last a bar or two (a month or two). Traders should expect a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar on the monthly chart before the end of the year.<li>October so far is a bull bar closing near its high. If the month remains like this, it will be a High 1 buy signal bar for November. November then would probably trade above the October high.<li>September was an outside down bar. Traders should understand that the month after an outside down bar rarely is an outside up bar. That would create an OO (outside-outside) Breakout Mode Pattern. While unlikely, October could rally strongly to above the September high before the end of the month.<li>There is still a 50% chance that either November or December will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 18 points in the overnight Globex session. It will gap above yesterday’s high.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day, even though the Emini was in a trading range around the 50-day MA for the final 4 hours.<li>The day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of being sideways to down for at least 2 hours, beginning by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>Even with a couple hours of sideways to down trading, the bulls will try to create a follow-through bull trend day today. The rally would probably be a weaker type of trend, like a bull channel or a trending trading range day.<li>There might be a pullback down to the 50-day MA, but today will probably not be a big bear day after yesterday’s surprisingly strong rally to the start of a resistance zone.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. Last week’s high is a magnet below, and it is near the daily magnet of the 50-day MA. There are no other nearby major weekly targets.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-break-above-50-day-moving-average-with-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-bull-trend-from-the-open-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-15.png\" alt=\"Emini break above 50-day MA (moving average) with small pullback bull trend and bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-bear-flag-in-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-15-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top bear flag in bear channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday was a doji bar with a big tail on top. So far, today is a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive doji, forming a potential micro double top.<li>The bears hope it is the 2<sup>nd</sup>high in a double top with the October 4 high.<li>They want a reversal down to below the October 12 neckline, and then a measured move down.<li>The bulls hope yesterday was a pullback from Wednesday’s strong reversal up from a micro wedge bottom. They want a reversal up from below yesterday’s low and then a bull trend.<li>The EURUSD has been in a tight trading range for 2 weeks. Traders are deciding if it will reach targets below before reversing up, or if the reversal up began this week.<li>The odds still favor a dip below the March 9, 2020 high within the next few weeks. This is true even if the EURUSD rallies a little higher. That high was the breakout point for last year’s strong rally, and the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 6 years. In a trading range, when a pullback gets near support or resistance, it usually goes through it before reversing.<li>Whether or not the EURUSD dips below the March 9, 2020 high or the June 10, 2020 high (a less important breakout point), it should rally to above the August 20 low. That is the breakout point for the September selloff and therefore a magnet above.<li>Consequently, traders should expect a rally for several weeks to at least above the August 20 low and maybe to the September 3 high (July 30/September 2 double top). However, it might 1<sup>st</sup>fall to 1.14, which is the June 10, 2020 high and the measured move down from the double top.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day-and-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day and broad bull channel\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>After a gap up, the Emini entered a triangle for 3 hours.<li>As I said early in the day, today would probably have a lot of trading range trading, and if there was a bull trend, today would likely be a Trending Trading Range day.<li>Because the week closed near its high, there is an increased chance of higher prices next week.

It will gap above yesterday’s high.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day, even though the Emini was in a trading range around the 50-day MA for the final 4 hours.<li>The day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of being sideways to down for at least 2 hours, beginning by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>Even with a couple hours of sideways to down trading, the bulls will try to create a follow-through bull trend day today. The rally would probably be a weaker type of trend, like a bull channel or a trending trading range day.<li>There might be a pullback down to the 50-day MA, but today will probably not be a big bear day after yesterday’s surprisingly strong rally to the start of a resistance zone.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. Last week’s high is a magnet below, and it is near the daily magnet of the 50-day MA. There are no other nearby major weekly targets.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-break-above-50-day-moving-average-with-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-bull-trend-from-the-open-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-15.png\" alt=\"Emini break above 50-day MA (moving average) with small pullback bull trend and bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-bear-flag-in-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-15-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top bear flag in bear channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday was a doji bar with a big tail on top.

They want a reversal up from below yesterday’s low and then a bull trend.<li>The EURUSD has been in a tight trading range for 2 weeks. Traders are deciding if it will reach targets below before reversing up, or if the reversal up began this week.<li>The odds still favor a dip below the March 9, 2020 high within the next few weeks. This is true even if the EURUSD rallies a little higher. That high was the breakout point for last year’s strong rally, and the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 6 years. In a trading range, when a pullback gets near support or resistance, it usually goes through it before reversing.<li>Whether or not the EURUSD dips below the March 9, 2020 high or the June 10, 2020 high (a less important breakout point), it should rally to above the August 20 low. That is the breakout point for the September selloff and therefore a magnet above.<li>Consequently, traders should expect a rally for several weeks to at least above the August 20 low and maybe to the September 3 high (July 30/September 2 double top).

Since it closed above Friday’s high, there is an increased chance of at least slightly higher prices today with breaking above lower high of September 3.<li>The day after an outside up day often largely overlaps the outside up day. Therefore, while a bull outside up day slightly increases the chance of a big bull trend, it is only slightly bullish.<li>When there is a gap above an outside up day, there is an increased chance of a selloff that closes the gap.<li>Since this is the 5th day in a rally within a 4-month trading range, there is an increased chance of disappointed bulls. That means traders should be ready for a possible sideways to down day today.<li>Traders are still deciding if the 2-week rally is just a bull leg in the 4-month trading range or a resumption of the bull trend.<li>There are now two consecutive bull bars closing near their highs and above the September 23 high. That makes it likely that the rally will reach the next resistance, which is the all-time high.<li>But because of the 4-month trading range, traders should expect a reversal from around that high, even if the Emini goes a little above it first.<li>Until there are consecutive closes above the September 2 high or below the October 4 low, all rallies and selloffs are more likely to be just legs in the trading range.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 15 points in the overnight Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up.<li>However, the day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>There is only a 25% chance of a 2nd consecutive strong bull trend today. If today is a bull trend, it should be a weaker variety, like a broad bull channel or a trending trading range day.<li>Also, since today is gapping up in a 50-day rally, but the rally is in a 4-month trading range, there is an increased chance of disappointing follow-through for the bulls today.<li>Can today be a strong bear trend day and sell off from the open and close the gap up? Of course it can, but if it sells off, there will probably be a lot of trading range trading. This is because a strong rally does not typically reverse into a bear trend without 1<sup>st</sup>transitioning to a trading range.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-outside-up-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-19.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend from the open and outside up day.

Since it closed above Friday’s high, there is an increased chance of at least slightly higher prices today with breaking above lower high of September 3.<li>The day after an outside up day often largely overlaps the outside up day. Therefore, while a bull outside up day slightly increases the chance of a big bull trend, it is only slightly bullish.<li>When there is a gap above an outside up day, there is an increased chance of a selloff that closes the gap.<li>Since this is the 5th day in a rally within a 4-month trading range, there is an increased chance of disappointed bulls. That means traders should be ready for a possible sideways to down day today.<li>Traders are still deciding if the 2-week rally is just a bull leg in the 4-month trading range or a resumption of the bull trend.<li>There are now two consecutive bull bars closing near their highs and above the September 23 high. That makes it likely that the rally will reach the next resistance, which is the all-time high.<li>But because of the 4-month trading range, traders should expect a reversal from around that high, even if the Emini goes a little above it first.<li>Until there are consecutive closes above the September 2 high or below the October 4 low, all rallies and selloffs are more likely to be just legs in the trading range.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 15 points in the overnight Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up.<li>However, the day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>There is only a 25% chance of a 2nd consecutive strong bull trend today. If today is a bull trend, it should be a weaker variety, like a broad bull channel or a trending trading range day.<li>Also, since today is gapping up in a 50-day rally, but the rally is in a 4-month trading range, there is an increased chance of disappointing follow-through for the bulls today.<li>Can today be a strong bear trend day and sell off from the open and close the gap up? Of course it can, but if it sells off, there will probably be a lot of trading range trading. This is because a strong rally does not typically reverse into a bear trend without 1<sup>st</sup>transitioning to a trading range.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-outside-up-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-19.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend from the open and outside up day.

That rally was from a micro wedge bottom and from just below the bottom of a yearlong trading range.<li>Also, after 5 consecutive bear bars on the weekly chart, the EURUSD was oversold.<li>Bulls bought below Friday’s low, and yesterday rallied to above Friday’s high. Yesterday was therefore an outside up day. That increased the chance of higher prices today.<li>That is especially true since I have been saying that there would soon be a reversal up to at least a little above the August 19 low (the August 20 low on the weekly chart). That was the breakout point of 3 years ago, and the EURUSD has been in a trading range for a year. When there is a trading range and nearby support or resistance, the market usually goes through it before reversing.<li>Traders are deciding if the rally will continue up to the September 3 high, or form a lower high and then reverse back down to below the March 9, 2020 breakout point.<li>It should soon rally for several weeks, and that rally might be underway.<li>However that March 9, 2020 high is an important magnet below. Also, the 5-day rally is a breakout above a tight bear channel since September 3. The 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up is typically minor. That means there is usually a test back down.<li>Unless the EURUSD accelerates up strongly over the next few days, it will probably test the October 12 low, and it still could dip at least a little below that March 3, 2020 high at around 1.15.<li>Whether this is the start of the 3 week rally or if there is one more brief new low, the bulls will try to get back to the September 3 high within a couple months.<li>Today rallied from the open and pulled back a little from just above the August 19 low, which was the near-term target.<li>If today closes 20 or more pips above that low, it should then continue up to the September 22 lower high.<li>More likely, it will stall around the August 19 low.

The Emini entered in a tight trading range for several hours in the middle of the day.<li>It reached the EMA by going sideways and formed a triangle.<li>There was a strong reversal down to the start of the bull channel (today was a Spike and Channel Bull Trend).<li>An ii led to a strong reversal up to a new high. The selloff was a Bear Trap.<li>This was the 1<sup>st</sup>close above the 4500 Big Round Number in over a month, which is good for the bulls.<li>The Emini might gap up again tomorrow. It might even gap to a new all-time high.<li>The magnet above is the all-time high of September 2.<li>The bulls want a strong breakout above that high.<li>However, after going sideways for 4 months and with the buy climax on the monthly chart, the Emini will probably have a difficult time getting much above 4,600, if it gets there.<li>Today was the 5<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull day, which is getting extreme.<li>Because it is still in a 4-month trading range, there is an increased chance of disappointing follow-through tomorrow. That means there is an increased chance of a bear bar on the daily chart tomorrow.<li>However, if the 5-day rally is actually a resumption of the 18-month bull trend, it can have many more bull bars.<li>Traders should find out over the next week if the rally is just a buy vacuum test of the top of the 4-month trading range or a resumption of the bull trend.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It could come today.<li>If there are consecutive bull bars closing at a new high, traders will begin to look for a measured move up, based on the 4-month trading range. That would be around 4800.<li>If the bulls get that, traders would then wonder if the rally will continue up to the 5,000 Big Round Number without more than a 3 – 5% correction.<li>The bears want a double top with the September high.<li>Most of the time when there is a double top, the 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up is weak. For example, it is often a wedge rally.<li>As strong as the rally has been over the past few weeks, it is important to understand that in a third of double tops, the 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up is a buy climax, like this one.<li>Therefore, if there is a bear signal bar closing near its low within the next week, many bulls will exit below and bears would begin shorting, betting on a double top with the September 2 all-time high.<li>A rally to a prior high typically stalls around the old high. This increases the chance of sideways trading for a few days. This is especially true with the 60-minute chart as overbought as it is.<li>The bulls who bought at the first high are relieved to be able to exit without a big loss, and the bulls who bought the bottom of the selloff take profits. Some bears also sell.<li>Traders wonder if there will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal down, creating a double top.<li>This is what we will find out at some point within a couple weeks. If there is a strong breakout to a new high, traders will expect at least a couple legs up and possible a measured move up.<li>If there is a reversal down, traders would look for a couple legs down to at least the middle of the trading range.<li>I have mentioned the outside down bar in September on the monthly chart several times. October traded below September’s low and is now just below September’s high.<li>If October breaks above the September high, it will be an outside up bar after an outside down bar. That is an OO (outside-outside) pattern, which is Breakout Mode.<li>Since the monthly chart is so overbought, if there is a bull breakout above the OO (if the OO forms), the OO might become the Final Bull Flag.<li>That means traders would look for a reversal back down within a few months. A reversal down would probably last 2 to 3 months.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 8 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday formed a double top lower high major trend reversal.<li>There was also a lower high double top. Yesterday’s low is the neckline of that double top.<li>Today will open around yesterday’s low. A break below yesterday’s low would trigger the double top sell signal.<li>There would also be a double top on the daily chart with the September high.<li>However, the bull trend has been very strong and yesterday was a bull bar. Therefore, there will probably be buyers not far below yesterday’s low. A 1- to 3-day pullback is more likely than a trend reversal on the daily chart.<li>Whenever there is a buy or sell signal, there is an increased chance of a trend day. The trend can be in either direction. That means a break below yesterday’s low could reverse up into a bull trend day.<li>Yesterday’s range was small. If today reverses up from below yesterday’s low to above yesterday’s high, today would be an outside up day.<li>Since the all-time high is only a few points above yesterday’s high, a break above yesterday’s high could break to a new all-time high.<li>Since that would be another breakout, it could also lead to a big move in either direction.<li>What is most likely? As I said, since the rally is testing a former high (the September all-time high), traders will probably need a few days to decide if there will be a big breakout or a reversal down. That means the Emini is most likely going to go sideways for a few days.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-parabolic-wedge-then-trading-range-just-below-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-21.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge then trading range just below and testing September all-time high.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is also a lower high micro double top with Tuesday’s high.<li>If today closes near its low, it will be a sell signal bar.

Below that is the October low, and then possibly the March 9, 2020 high, which was last year’s breakout point.<li>I have said several times that the downside magnet is the March 9, 2020 high. Furthermore, I said that if the EURUSD gets there, it will probably not go much lower before reversing up for several weeks.<li>Because the bear channel from the September high is tight, the current 2-week rally will probably be minor. That means there should be a test back down starting within a week or so.<li>But if there is a test down, traders will buy around the October low.

Consecutive outside bars forms an OO pattern, which means Breakout Mode.<li>In November, the bulls want a breakout above the October high to trigger an OO buy signal.<li>That would also be a breakout above the 4-month range. The bulls would then want a 267-point measured move up to 4802.<li>Bears want breakout below the October low and at least a 267-point measured move down from below that low. After such a strong rally in October, November is more likely to go above the October high than below its low.<li>Because of the strong rally on the daily chart and a breakout above the prior high, there is an increased chance of a strong rally over the next couple weeks.<li>There is therefore an increased chance of a big gap up tomorrow or early next week.<li>Can the bears get a higher high major trend reversal down? After such a strong rally over the past 3 weeks, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get a reversal down.

It could come today.<li>If there are consecutive bull bars closing at a new high, traders will begin to look for a measured move up, based on the 4-month trading range. That would be around 4800.<li>If the bulls get that, traders would then wonder if the rally will continue up to the 5,000 Big Round Number without more than a 3 – 5% correction.<li>The bears want a double top with the September high.<li>Most of the time when there is a double top, the 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up is weak. For example, it is often a wedge rally.<li>As strong as the rally has been over the past few weeks, it is important to understand that in a third of double tops, the 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up is a buy climax, like this one.<li>Therefore, if there is a bear signal bar closing near its low within the next week, many bulls will exit below and bears would begin shorting, betting on a double top with the September 2 all-time high.<li>A rally to a prior high typically stalls around the old high. This increases the chance of sideways trading for a few days. This is especially true with the 60-minute chart as overbought as it is.<li>The bulls who bought at the first high are relieved to be able to exit without a big loss, and the bulls who bought the bottom of the selloff take profits. Some bears also sell.<li>Traders wonder if there will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal down, creating a double top.<li>This is what we will find out at some point within a couple weeks. If there is a strong breakout to a new high, traders will expect at least a couple legs up and possible a measured move up.<li>If there is a reversal down, traders would look for a couple legs down to at least the middle of the trading range.<li>I have mentioned the outside down bar in September on the monthly chart several times. October traded below September’s low and is now just below September’s high.<li>If October breaks above the September high, it will be an outside up bar after an outside down bar. That is an OO (outside-outside) pattern, which is Breakout Mode.<li>Since the monthly chart is so overbought, if there is a bull breakout above the OO (if the OO forms), the OO might become the Final Bull Flag.<li>That means traders would look for a reversal back down within a few months. A reversal down would probably last 2 to 3 months.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 8 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday formed a double top lower high major trend reversal.<li>There was also a lower high double top. Yesterday’s low is the neckline of that double top.<li>Today will open around yesterday’s low. A break below yesterday’s low would trigger the double top sell signal.<li>There would also be a double top on the daily chart with the September high.<li>However, the bull trend has been very strong and yesterday was a bull bar. Therefore, there will probably be buyers not far below yesterday’s low. A 1- to 3-day pullback is more likely than a trend reversal on the daily chart.<li>Whenever there is a buy or sell signal, there is an increased chance of a trend day. The trend can be in either direction. That means a break below yesterday’s low could reverse up into a bull trend day.<li>Yesterday’s range was small. If today reverses up from below yesterday’s low to above yesterday’s high, today would be an outside up day.<li>Since the all-time high is only a few points above yesterday’s high, a break above yesterday’s high could break to a new all-time high.<li>Since that would be another breakout, it could also lead to a big move in either direction.<li>What is most likely? As I said, since the rally is testing a former high (the September all-time high), traders will probably need a few days to decide if there will be a big breakout or a reversal down. That means the Emini is most likely going to go sideways for a few days.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-parabolic-wedge-then-trading-range-just-below-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-21.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge then trading range just below and testing September all-time high.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EURUSD-Forex-micro-wedge-rally-to-test-breakout-point.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-21-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday was the 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull candlestick after the reversal up from below the bottom of the yearlong trading range.<li>Six consecutive bull bars is sustained buying. It increases the chance that the rally will continue higher before falling much below the October low.<li>However, since it is unusual, it is climactic. That increases the chance of a test down soon.<li>It tested above the August 19 low, which is resistance. It might go sideways for a few days while traders decide if the rally will continue or reverse down and test the October low.<li>Today so far is a bear day. It is also a lower high micro double top with Tuesday’s high.<li>If today closes near its low, it will be a sell signal bar. There would be a micro double top and a truncated micro wedge over the past 3 days. Truncated means that the 3<sup>rd</sup>high did not go above the 2<sup>nd</sup>high in the wedge.<li>If there is a reversal down, traders would look for a test of the start of the wedge, which was the October 18 low. Below that is the October low, and then possibly the March 9, 2020 high, which was last year’s breakout point.<li>I have said several times that the downside magnet is the March 9, 2020 high. Furthermore, I said that if the EURUSD gets there, it will probably not go much lower before reversing up for several weeks.<li>Because the bear channel from the September high is tight, the current 2-week rally will probably be minor. That means there should be a test back down starting within a week or so.<li>But if there is a test down, traders will buy around the October low. They expect this reversal up to test the September 3 high, whether or not there is a dip below the March 9, 2020 first.<li>Traders are probably becoming more interested in buying selloffs than selling rallies.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-triangle-with-late-breakout-to-new-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-21-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Early rally to just above yesterday’s high, but reversed down again from just below all-time high. The Emini entered a triangle for 4 hours.<li>Late breakout above triangle. Emini made a new all-time high.<li>By breaking above September all-time high, October is now an outside up month. September was an outside down month. Consecutive outside bars forms an OO pattern, which means Breakout Mode.<li>In November, the bulls want a breakout above the October high to trigger an OO buy signal.<li>That would also be a breakout above the 4-month range. The bulls would then want a 267-point measured move up to 4802.<li>Bears want breakout below the October low and at least a 267-point measured move down from below that low. After such a strong rally in October, November is more likely to go above the October high than below its low.<li>Because of the strong rally on the daily chart and a breakout above the prior high, there is an increased chance of a strong rally over the next couple weeks.<li>There is therefore an increased chance of a big gap up tomorrow or early next week.<li>Can the bears get a higher high major trend reversal down? After such a strong rally over the past 3 weeks, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get a reversal down. It is too early to look for shorts.<li>7 consecutive bull bars is a strong rally.

It might have to dip below the March 9, 2020 Breakout Point before there is a sustained rally up to the September 3 high.<h2 id=\"1-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-test-of-March-2020-high-and-failed-breakout-below-head-and-shoulders-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-24.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex breakout test of March 2020 high and failed breakout below head and shoulders top\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a second consecutive bull bar. Since it had a prominent tail on top, it is less bullish than it might have been.<li>The bulls are hoping that the past 2 weeks are the start of a reversal up from below the yearlong trading range, which is also a head and shoulders top.<li>There are 2 problems with this reversal.<li>First, it followed 5 consecutive bear bars, which means relentless selling. That increases the chance that the bulls will need a micro double bottom before they can get a reversal up to the September 3 high.<li>Second, the EURUSD has been in a trading rang for 7 years. When there is a trading range, traders look for reversals. They usually come after probing beyond support or resistance.<li>A reversal up from below the yearlong trading range is consistent with that.<li>However, 2020 broke strongly above the June 10, 2020 and the March 9, 2020 highs. This reversal up did not dip below either of those breakout points, but it got close. Since the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years, those are very important support levels, and they are within reach. That means that they are still strong magnets below.<li>If traders see the 10-month selloff on the weekly chart as a wedge bull flag (with the March 31 and August 20 lows), then the reversal up from above a breakout point makes sense.<li>However, it is more likely that the selloff is a bear leg in the trading range. Therefore, unless the rally continues up for at least a couple more weeks, the odds are that there will be one more leg down to below the March 9, 2020 high.<li>What happens if the EURUSD falls below both breakout points? It should then reverse up.<li>Why? Because legs up and down in trading ranges typically disappoint bulls and bears.<li>A break below major support therefore should disappoint the bulls.<li>That means there would probably be a reversal up, which would disappoint the bears.<li>This year’s selloff is still only about a 50% pullback from last year’s strong rally. Consequently, traders should soon expect a rally lasting at least several weeks. The bulls need to do more before traders believe it is underway.<li>Therefore, there is still better than a 50% chance of a dip below one or both breakout points before there is a sustained rally back to the September 3 lower high.<li>The odds are that there is not much left to this selloff before there is a rally up to near the September 3 high.</ul><h2 id=\"3-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"4-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-consecutive-outside-bars-in-strong-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-24-1.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart has consecutive outside bars in strong bull trend. 2nd consecutive outside bar.\"></a></figure><ul><li>The candlestick on the monthly Emini chart is a big bull bar closing near its high with one week remaining in October.<li>September was a big bear bar and an outside down bar. That means it traded above the August high and then below the August low.<li>October is an outside up bar.<li>Consecutive outside bars is an OO (outside-outside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode condition. Theoretically, bulls will buy above and bears will sell below. Both will look for at least a measured move based on the height of the pattern.<li>There is one week of trading remaining in October. The more the candlestick closes on its high, the more likely the Emini will trade higher in November. The bulls would also like the month to close above the September high.<li>If October closes near its high, November might gap above the October high and create a rare gap on the monthly chart.<li>Rarely, an outside up bar reverses down before it closes and then goes back below the low of the prior bar. It then becomes an outside down bar. With the monthly chart being in a strong bull trend and having a surprisingly strong reversal up in October, that is very unlikely. The bears would be happy if the month closed below the middle of its range. Even that is unlikely at this point.<li>September was the third time that a bear bar interrupted the strong rally on the monthly chart. A third reversal attempt has a higher probability of being successful.<li>Most prior bear bars in buy climaxes on the monthly chart led to a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar within a bar or two. That means the bears hope that November rallies and then reverses down at the end of the month to close below the open of the month.<li>Will that happen? With October being surprisingly strong, November will likely be another bull bar. Traders will begin to wonder if the Emini will reach the 5,000 Big Round Number before there is more than a one month reversal.<li>How much higher can the buy climax continue? Climactic rallies often last far longer than what might appear reasonable.<li>However, an OO pattern is a pause and a brief area of agreement. Three sideways bars is often a magnet, which tends to draw the market back to it after a breakout. Therefore, there is an increased chance that it will be the Final Bull Flag before there is a correction lasting at least a few bars.<li>However, the breakout above the OO often lasts several bars before there is a reversal. That means traders should expect higher prices at least into early November, and probably for at least a measured move up based on the height of the OO. That target is around 4,800.</ul><h3 id=\"5-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-SP500-weely-candlestick-chart-has-3-consecutive-bull-bars-breaking-out-to-new-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weelky candlestick chart has 3 consecutive bull bars breaking out to new all time high\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini candlestick was the 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive bull bar closing near its high after a 6-week pullback in a Small Pullback Bull Trend.<li>The bears want a double top with the September high, but the 3 strong bull bars after a 6-bar bear micro channel was a low probability event. A surprise typically has at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up. Therefore, the bears would need a surprisingly strong bear bar next week before traders would look for a double top reversal.<li>More likely, next week will be sideways to up.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend is a bull trend where the pullbacks are small. This one began with the pandemic crash. The biggest pullback was 10% and it came a year ago.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend ends with a big pullback. That means a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than the biggest prior pullback. Here, the trend will remain intact until there is at least a 15% correction.<li>Once it ends, the bull trend typically converts into a trading range. Initially, the odds are that it will be a bull flag. Traders expect the trend to resume. If it does, it is usually a weaker bull trend.<li>If the trading range lasts 20 or more bars, the probability of a reversal into a bear trend begins to get close to 50%.<li>After the September selloff, I said there was a 50% chance that the Small Pullback Bull Trend was ending. But I also said that there was a 50% chance that it would continue. The strong rally over the past 2 weeks shows that the trend is intact.<li>What is the next target for the bulls? The bears want a double top with the September high. Their attempt will probably fail. Instead of looking for a measured move down, traders should look for a measured move up. Therefore, the target is the same 4,800 target that the monthly chart is projecting.</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-has-is-breaking-out-to-new-all-time-high-but-possible-expanding-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-24-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart has is breaking out to new all time high but possible expanding triangle\"></a></figure><ul><li>Friday’s candlestick on the daily Emini chart had a small bear body after a streak of 7 consecutive bull bars.<li>It traded above Thursday’s high and below its low. Friday was an outside bar.<li>It is only a doji bar, which is a low probability sell signal or buy signal bar.<li>It is neutral and increases the chance of more sideways trading on Monday.<li>Also, the day after a big day that closes in its middle has an increased chance of having a lot of overlap with that day. This increases the chance of a 4<sup>th</sup>sideways day as traders decide if the breakout above the 4-month trading range will succeed.<li>A streak of 7 consecutive bull bars is a sign of relentless bulls. They therefore will buy the first 1- to 3-bar pause or reversal down.<li>It is important to note that there are now consecutive closes above the September high, but Friday had a bear body and it did not close near the high of the bar. Therefore, this breakout above the September high so far is not as convincing as it could be.<li>The small breakout with the hesitation still gives the bears hope that the breakout will fail. It increases the chance of the Emini stalling here for several more days as traders decide it the breakout will succeed or fail.<li>But the bears will need at least a micro double top or three consecutive bear bars closing near their lows before traders will think about a possible reversal down from a double top with the September high.<li>If there was a reversal, it would be from a higher high major trend reversal and an expanding triangle top at around a measured move up from the pandemic low to the pre-pandemic high (see weekly chart above).<li>There would still be only a 40% chance of an actual trend reversal. A trend reversal down means a bear trend after a bull trend. Sixty-percent of the time, a major trend reversal ends up being minor. That means either a bull flag or a trading range.<li>Consequently, traders should expect higher prices.<li>How high? The 4-month trading range is from the September high to the October low. It is therefore 267.25 points tall. A measured move up would be 4802.00, or about 4800.<li>That is close enough to the 5,000 Big Round Number to make traders begin to think that the rally will reach it before there is more than a small correction.<li>Will the Emini reach the 4800 magnet, or will the breakout above the September high fail? It might do neither. At the moment, traders should expect higher prices, possibly for the rest of the year.<li>However, the rally to the September high has been extreme. That increases the chance of several sideways days over the coming week. But unless the bears begin to turn the Emini down, it should go higher.</ul><h3 id=\"7-final-week-of-october\">Final week of October</h3><ul><li>Next Friday is the final day of the week and of the month. Markets often have surprising big moves in either direction just before a bar closes.<li>That means weekly and monthly support and resistance might be important at the end of the week, especially in the final hour on Friday.<li>The most important magnets are the September high and the high of the month. The more the month closes above the September high and at the high of the month, the more likely the strong rally will continue into November.<li>The bears would need a big selloff next week to change that. If they get it, November might be more sideways than up.</ul><h2 id=\"8-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is the 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive bull bar closing above the September high (Friday’s close on the 5-minute chart was below the open, but it was above the open on the daily chart). The Emini strong breakout increases the chance of higher prices.<li>The next resistance is the 4,600 Big Round number. Then, traders will look for a test of the top of the yearlong bull channel. That is currently around 4680.<li>Above that is 4802.00, which is the measured move target, based on the height of the 4-month trading range.<li>Any breakout can fail at any time. But the more bullish things that are present, the lower the probability of a reversal.<li>Yesterday was the 8<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar on the daily chart. That is getting somewhat extreme, but there was a streak of 14 bull bars 3 years ago. Therefore, this streak could easily last all week.<li>If there is a reversal down this week, it will be from a higher high double top. That would also be a higher high major trend reversal and an<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-has-is-breaking-out-to-new-all-time-high-but-possible-expanding-triangle.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expanding triangle top</a>, which I mentioned over the weekend.<li>When a rally is strong, like this one has been, the bears typically need at least a micro double top before they can get a reversal down.<li>Even if there is a reversal down, traders will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>1- to 3-day selloff. With the Emini as overbought as it is on the 60-minute chart, there should be a pullback this week.<li>The bears will need at least a couple big bear bars before traders will again begin to think about a possible bear trend reversal.<li>Even then, until there are consecutive closes below major support, the odds will continue to favor higher prices.<li>The best the bears can probably get over the next month is a move back to the middle of the July to October trading range.<li>This is the final week of October. October is an outside up bar on the monthly chart, and September was an outside down bar. The more the month closes near its high, the more likely November will continue high.<li>It is important to note that a bar often changes its appearance just before it closes. Therefore, there might be a selloff at the end of the week that puts a conspicuous tail on the top of this month’s candlestick. But even if it does, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in November.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 18 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>It will gap up to a new all-time high.<li>After 8 consecutive bull days, traders will try for another today. Therefore, there will be many traders looking to buy any selloff.<li>The 60-minute chart has been in a tight bull channel since the streak of bull days began 9 days ago. That is extreme on the 60-minute chart, and it increases the chance of a sideways to down move today or tomorrow. But a sideways to down move for a few hours could still reverse up and close above the open.<li>In a strong trend, more traders are looking to buy. That increases the chance of at least one swing up today.<li>But with the Emini so overbought on the 60-minute chart, the odds of at least several hours down are increasing.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-sell-climax-and-then-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend-and-trading-range-at-new-all-time-high-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-26.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and then Small Pullback Bull Trend and trading range at new all time high. Emini strong breakout likely.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EURUSD-Forex-9-day-tight-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-26-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex 9 day tight trading range\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday was an outside down day and it closed below Friday’s low, but in the middle third of the day’s range.<li>Today so far is an inside day with a small range and a bull body. It is neutral.<li>The EURUSD has been in a tight trading range for 9 days. That increases the chance of more sideways trading.<li>The bulls hope it is a pause in a bull trend reversal that began on October 12. They want the October low to be the low for the remainder of the year.<li>I have been saying that the 3-week rally more likely would be minor and should lead to a test of the October low. But the more days that go sideways, the more likely the bottom is in and that there will be a resumption up. A couple big bull days would make the reversal up a credible higher low major trend reversal.<li>Currently, there is still a 50% chance of a test down to below the March 9, 2020 high within the next few weeks. That was the breakout point of last year’s strong rally. Since the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 7 years, traders should expect tests beyond support and resistance.<li>That March 9, 2020 high is major support and the current price is near enough to make traders wonder if the selloff will have to get there before the bulls will attempt a test of the September 3 high.<li>If the 7-month bear trend resumes this week, it will probably end around that March 2020 high or the June 10, 2020 high, which is the next lower breakout point.<li>Traders should expect a reversal up that lasts at least several weeks. It should begin from around the October low or as far down as the June 10, 2020 high at around 1.14. That is also the measured move down from the July 30/September 3 double top.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-failed-breakout-above-triangle-and-then-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini failed breakout above triangle and then bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>After a weak rally on the open, the Emini entered a triangle.<li>There was a Major Bear Surprise Bar and a selloff for about a measured move down to below yesterday’s high.<li>The selloff was a parabolic wedge sell climax.

October is an outside up bar on the monthly chart, and September was an outside down bar. The more the month closes near its high, the more likely November will continue high.<li>It is important to note that a bar often changes its appearance just before it closes. Therefore, there might be a selloff at the end of the week that puts a conspicuous tail on the top of this month’s candlestick. But even if it does, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in November.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 18 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>It will gap up to a new all-time high.<li>After 8 consecutive bull days, traders will try for another today. Therefore, there will be many traders looking to buy any selloff.<li>The 60-minute chart has been in a tight bull channel since the streak of bull days began 9 days ago. That is extreme on the 60-minute chart, and it increases the chance of a sideways to down move today or tomorrow. But a sideways to down move for a few hours could still reverse up and close above the open.<li>In a strong trend, more traders are looking to buy.

It is unlikely to make a new high by tomorrow’s close after consecutive bear bars closing near their lows.

Since it came in a strong bull trend, the reversal down should be only a few days days.<li>Because yesterday closed on its low with the Emini pulling back, reversing down from above the 4-month trading range (September 2 high), today should trade below yesterday’s low.<li>The bears want a 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive bear bar, which would increase the chance of at least a couple small legs sideways to down.<li>Yesterday was a pullback in a bull trend. It is therefore a High 1 buy signal bar. But it was a big bear bar and the 2nd consecutive bear bar in a buy climax at resistance (the September high). There will probably be sellers not far above yesterday’s high.<li>Yesterday’s selloff was a test of the open of the week, and yesterday closed 2 ticks below the open of the week.<li>The bears want a bear bar this week on the weekly chart to increase the chance that the breakout above the top of the 4-month trading range will fail. The open of the week could be a magnet for the final 2 days of the week.<li>They would also like October to close (Friday is the final trading day of the month) below the September high to reduce the chance of a big rally in November.<li>Most bars do not close on their highs. That increases the chance of a pullback going into the end of the month, which would create a visible tail on the top of October’s bar on the monthly chart.<li>After October formed an outside up month after September was an outside down month, the odds already favored at least slightly higher prices in November.<li>The bears would need several big bear bars on the daily chart before traders would conclude that the breakout above the September 2 high at the top of the 4-month trading range might fail.<li>Without that, traders will continue to expect higher prices.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 14 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Since yesterday was a sell climax, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple legs sideways to up, starting by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>Because yesterday was a big bear day closing near its low and the 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive bear day, today or tomorrow should test below yesterday’s low.<li>While the bears want a higher high double top with the September high, a minor reversal down is more likely. Consequently, the odds are against a big bear day today.<li>Yesterday was a test of the open of the week. It broke slightly below and then stopped. That hesitation increases the chance of another test of the open of the week today.<li>The next support below that is last month’s high. Remember, I have been saying for the past week that the month might sell off at the end of the month. Has it sold off enough? Maybe, but it might have to test the September high.<li>Can the Emini reverse back up to the high from these support levels by the time October closes tomorrow? It is unlikely to make a new high by tomorrow’s close after consecutive bear bars closing near their lows. That reduces the chance of a big bull day today.<li>Since yesterday collapsed down to support, there is an increase chance of some back filling. The Emini might enter a trading range today between the open of the week at 4544 and the 60-minute EMA above, around 4560.<li>Since those prices are only 16 points apart, if there is a trading range, its height should be bigger.

March 9, 2020 high and the June 10, 2020 high were breakout points for last year’s strong rally therefore strong magnets.<li>When a market is in a trading range and it gets near support or resistance, it usually goes beyond it before reversing.<li>Friday’s big bear bar increased the chance that it will happen within a couple of weeks.<li>For now, odds slightly favor a test of 1.15 or possibly 1.14 before we see a stronger reversal attempt by the bulls.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-Monthly-Outside-Outside-Bar-–-Breakout-Mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-31-3.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Outside-Outside Pattern on monthly chart is Breakout Mode\"></a></figure><ul><li>The October monthly Emini candlestick was a second consecutive outside bar at new high. An OO (outside-outside) pattern means the Emini is in breakout mode.<li>November will likely trade above October’s high. Monday could gap up, creating a rare gap on the monthly chart. However, small gaps usually close early.<li>Theoretically, bulls will buy above and bears will sell below October’s bar. Both will look for at least a measured move based on the height of the pattern. For the bulls, a measured move up is 4934.50.<li>September was the third time that a bear bar interrupted the strong rally on the monthly chart. A third reversal attempt has a higher probability of being successful.<li>Most prior bear bars in buy climaxes on the monthly chart led to a 2<sup>nd</sup>bear bar within a bar or two. That means the bears hope that November rallies and then reverses down at the end of the month to close below the open of the month.<li>Will that happen? With October being surprisingly strong, November will likely be another bull bar. Traders will begin to wonder if the Emini will reach the 5,000 Big Round Number before there is more than a one-month reversal.<li>How much higher can the buy climax continue? Climactic rallies often last far longer than what might appear reasonable.<li>An OO pattern is a pause and a brief area of agreement. It is usually an expanding triangle on a smaller time frame.<li>Three sideways bars are often a magnet, which tends to draw the market back to it after a breakout. Therefore, there is an increased chance that it will be the Final Bull Flag before there is a correction lasting at least a few bars (months).&nbsp;<li>However, the breakout above the OO often lasts several bars before there is a reversal. That means traders should expect higher prices at least into early November, and probably for at least a measured move up based on the height of the OO.<li>The bears want a reversal down, even if there is first a breakout above the monthly OO pattern.&nbsp;<li>An inside bar after an outside bar is common. If November is a bear inside bar closing near its low, there would be an ioi Breakout mode pattern (August is inside of September’s range). That, or any bear bar closing near its low in November or December, would be a credible sell signal on the monthly chart.<li>For now, the odds favor at least slightly higher prices in November. However, there is always a bear case, and a 40% chance of it happening.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-Weekly-4-Consecutive-Bull-Bars-Breaking-To-New-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-31-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Weekly Chart 4 Consecutive Bull Bars Breaking to New High\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was the 4<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar, and it closed at new high.<li>Since this week closed near the high of the bar, next week could gap up on the weekly chart. If the gap is small, it is important to remember that a small gap usually closes early.<li>The next targets for the bulls are the trend channel line around 4700 and 4802.00 That is the measured move target based on the height of the 4-month trading range (Jul-Oct).<li>Al has said that while there was a 50% chance that the Small Pullback Bull Trend was ending in September, there was also a 50% chance that it would continue. The strong rally over the past 3 weeks shows that the trend is intact.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend is a bull trend where the pullbacks are small. This one began with the pandemic crash. The biggest pullback was 10% and it came a year ago.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend ends with a big pullback. That means a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than the biggest prior pullback. Here, the trend will remain intact until there is at least a 15% correction.&nbsp;<li>Once it ends, the bull trend typically converts into a trading range. Initially, the odds are that it will be a bull flag. Traders expect the trend to resume. If it does, it is usually a weaker bull trend.<li>If the trading range lasts 20 or more bars, the probability of a reversal into a bear trend begins to get close to 50%.<li>The bears want a higher high double top major trend reversal with the September high but the 4 strong bull bars after a 6-bar bear microchannel was a low probability event. A surprise typically has at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up.&nbsp;<li>Therefore, the bears would need a surprisingly strong bear bar and a micro double top before traders would look for a reversal.<li>For now, odds slightly favor sideways to up for November.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Emini-Daily-New-High-but-Expanding-Triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-10-31-5.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart New High but Expanding Triangle\"></a></figure><ul><li>Friday made another new all-time high and it was another bull bar closing near its high.

That increases the chance of several sideways days over the coming week.&nbsp;There will probably be a trading range lasting at least a couple weeks at some point before the end of the year.<li>But unless the bears get consecutive big bear bars closing near the lows, the odds continue to favor at least slightly higher prices.
