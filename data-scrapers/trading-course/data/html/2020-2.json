The Emini is down 4%. Two weeks ago, I said it would probably fall at least 5%, starting within 3 weeks. It started 3 days later. Friday’s Bear Surprise Bar makes it likely that the Emini will fall at least to 3170, which is a 5% correction.<p><strong>Bonds</strong>have rallied strongly for the past 2 weeks. They will probably have at least a small 2nd leg up after the 1st 1 – 2 week pullback.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>weekly Forex chart formed a bull reversal bar this week and a double bottom. But after 4 bear bars, the 1st reversal up will probably be minor.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Strong breakout above 4 month bull flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bond-futures-weekly-chart-breakout-above-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly chart breakout above bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures market has been sideways for 6 months. On the monthly chart (not shown), there were 4 consecutive bear bars after a 2019 parabolic wedge rally. That is a weak bull flag. Traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>On the weekly chart, the past 2 weeks were big bull bars closing near their highs. For the past 6 weeks, I have been saying that the bond market would rally. The bonds broke far above the 3 month trading range 2 weeks ago. The breakout was surprisingly big. Traders therefore expect at least a small 2nd leg up. As a result, they will look to buy the 1st reversal down. Consequently, the downside risk is small for the next couple weeks.<h3>Conflicting signals on weekly and monthly charts</h3><p>How should traders reconcile the monthly and weekly charts? The monthly chart should have a 2nd leg sideways to down. It typically would come from a lower high.<p>The weekly chart should have at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. There is room to the all-time high for the weekly chart to have a pullback and a 2nd leg up, with that 2nd leg up staying below the August all-time high.<p>But even if the bulls get a new high, it will probably fail to go far above the August high. The 6 month trading range will likely continue for at least a few more months.<h3>What about zero interest rates?</h3><p>I have discussed this several times.<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The American public will not accept zero interest rates (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\">The American public will not accept zero interest rates</a>. Therefore, bonds probably cannot break far above the August all-time high.<p>Also, there is a 10 year nested wedge top on the monthly chart (I have shown it many times in prior Weekend Updates). Even though 2019 broke above the top, the breakout was small. The bond market is probably creating a top that will last for 20 years. Such a major reversal can take years to complete. It is like turning a supertanker on the ocean. The turn takes several miles. A turn in a 30 year bull trend takes several years.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Double higher low major trend reversal, but in trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-chart-reversing-up-from-double-bottom-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-1-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly chart reversing up from double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart broke below 1.10 this week and reversed up. The bulls see the reversal as forming a higher low double bottom with the November 29 low.<p>This is therefore a double bottom higher low major trend reversal. This week is a buy signal bar. But there have been many buy and sell signals for 2 years. None has resulted in a trend. Consequently, traders continue to look for legs up and down to reverse every few weeks.<p>After 4 consecutive bear bars, the 1st reversal up will probably be minor. This is true despite this week was being a big bull bar closing near its high.<p>Look at the swings up and down over the past year. All have had at least 2 legs. Traders expect that there will be at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down before the bulls can get more than a 3 week rally from here.<h3>Will the EURUSD go up or down over the next month?</h3><p>What happens if the weekly chart rallies for a few weeks and reverses down from a lower high? Traders will see the rally as the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top. The left shoulder would be the October 21 lower high.<p>If however, the next several weeks are big bull bars and they break above the January high, traders will begin to believe that the 2 year bear trend is reversing up into a bull trend.<p>Traders continue to correctly believe that there will eventually be a rally up to the September 2018 high. That was the start of the bear channel. The start of the bear channel is a reliable magnet.<p>It is currently not yet clear that the bear trend and 6 month trading range have ended. Until they clearly have, the odds are that hey have not. Traders will continue to look for reversals every few weeks.<h3>Monthly chart has outside down candlestick in January</h3><p>January traded above the December high and then below the December low. It therefore formed an outside down candlestick on the monthly chart (not shown).<p>While an outside down bar can be bearish, context is important. The monthly chart has been in a tight trading range for 6 months. An outside bar in a tight trading range does not change the pattern. The chart is still in a tight trading range.<p>That is a limit order market. Consequently, there will probably be more buyers below the prior bar than sellers. It is more likely that February will be another sideways bar than the start of a bear breakout.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>January is minor sell signal bar on Emini monthly chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-failed-breakout-above-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart has failed breakout above bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;formed a small bear reversal bar in January. The bears wanted January to be a big bear bar closing on its low. It would then have been a stronger sell signal bar for a failed breakout above the 13 year bull channel.<p>I have written several times about the bull channel. I kept making the point that a breakout above a bull channel typically reverses back down within 5 bars. January is the 2nd bar of the breakout and it is reversing down.<p>However, the prior 4 months were all bull bars closing near their highs. While climactic, that is a strong bull breakout. Traders believe that the 1st reversal down will be minor and that there will then be at least a small 2nd leg up.<p>A minor reversal is often just a 1 – 2 bar pullback. Since this is a monthly chart, traders expect any selling to last a month or two. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get more than a 2 bar reversal down.<p>It is important to consider what will happen if February is a big bear bar closing near its low. Traders would then look for the selloff to test the middle of the channel at around 2900.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>At least 2 legs down after buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-reversal-down-from-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-1-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart has reversal down from parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart traded below last week’s low. It therefore triggered a minor weekly sell signal.<p>The sell signal was at the top of the 3rd leg up in a 4 month tight bull channel. That means that the rally was a parabolic buy climax. After an extreme buy climax, traders expect more than a 1 bar pullback.<p>Furthermore, I wrote 2 weeks ago that the Emini would soon begin a 5% correction. That is because the 2 big bull bars on the weekly chart in mid-January formed the strongest consecutive bull bars late in a bull trend.<p>When that happens, there is a 60% chance that the next week will be the top, or there will be one more brief leg up and that will be the top.<p>There was a similar pattern in January 2018. That time, there was a one bar 2nd leg up, and then a 10% correction. This time, the Emini immediately reversed after the 2 buy climax bars.<h3>Can the correction end at 4% instead of 5%?</h3><p>This week’s low is 4% from the high. It reached the bottom of the 2 big bull bars on the weekly chart. I have been saying that the bottom of the most recent buy climax was the 1st target once there was a reversal. The bears reached that target in Friday.<p>Can the Emini form a double bottom with that low and resume up next week? There are several problems with this. Friday’s selloff was surprisingly strong on the daily chart. A Bear Surprise Bar typically has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. Also, a reversal down from a buy climax typically has at least 2 legs down.<p>Next, another common target after a buy climax is a test of the 20 week EMA. That is now around 3160. Then there is the issue of psychological support.<h3>Psychological support</h3><p>Psychological support can be important. Many traders simply how they think of the market. That makes round numbers like 100, 500, 1000, 3,000 etc. important. For example, 3000, 3100, 3200, and 3300 have all been magnets in the Emini.<p>In terms of pullbacks, traders look to buy when the market has fallen 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, or 20%. Look at last year. There were many pullbacks that ended almost exactly at 5, 10 or 20%. Once a selloff approached the target, many bulls stopped buying. They knew that a pullback that gets near support, even psychological support, will usually reach the support before reversing up.<p>The current selloff is now 4%. Many bulls will not buy unless it falls to at least 5%. The result is that a 4% pullback usually grows into a pullback that is 5% or more.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Bear Surprise Bar makes another leg down likely</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-is-breaking-below-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-1-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart is breaking below bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had several big days up and down over the past couple of weeks. Because of the consecutive big bull bars on the weekly chart, I wrote 2 weeks ago that the Emini had a 60% chance of beginning at least a 5% correction within 3 weeks. It began a few days after my report.<p>Friday was the biggest bear bar on the daily chart since the corrections from July to October last year. When a bar is surprisingly big, many bears missed the short and want to short a rally. There are many bulls who now have decided that their longs are bad. They, too, want a rally so that they can exit with a smaller loss.<p>With both bulls and bears looking to sell the 1st 2 – 3 day rally, there will usually be at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. As a result, traders expect that the 1st reversal up from a Bear Surprise Breakout will be minor. They will not aggressively buy until there is at least one more leg down and then a 2nd attempt to reverse up.<p>It is important to remember that the 4 month bull trend has been strong. If the Emini reverses up strongly next week, traders will conclude that the correction is over. At the moment, there is a 70% chance of at least slightly lower prices.<h3>Why might the correction reach 5%?</h3><p>A selloff from a buy climax typically tests the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the January 6 low of 3213.25, which is about a 4% correction. Traders like 2, 5, 10, and 20% corrections. Many look to buy at those levels. Four percent is near 5%. Many bulls will not buy until they get that extra 1%.<p>Also, the 3200 Big Round Number is a magnet, and it is below that January 6 low. Consequently, traders will expect at least a 5% correction, which is at 3170.<p>The 4 month rally broke above a 2 year trading range. Markets usually come back to test the breakout point. If the bulls buy again at that price, traders will be more confident that the trend up will continue. Therefore, traders have to consider the possibility of a pullback to the top of the 2 year range at around 3000.<p>If it happened, the pullback would be about 10%. But traders see the monthly and weekly bull trends as strong. They will therefore buy a reversal up from the pullback, whether it is 5 or 10%.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

January closed near its low. It is a sell signal bar on the monthly chart. The sell signal will probably trigger early this week.<p>However, it followed 4 bull bars closing near their highs on the monthly chart. This is therefore a weak sell setup. The best the bears will probably get is a 1 – 2 bar pullback. Since that is the monthly chart, the pullback will probably last a few weeks to maybe a couple months.<p>I wrote a few weeks ago that the minimum goal for the bears was 5%. Nothing has changed. What is unknown is the path. Because of the strong 4 month rally, there will be bulls buying every selloff. Therefore, if the Emini continues down, it will probably have a lot of trading range price action along the way.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Today is the follow-through bar after Friday’s big bear breakout. The bears want a bear bar. That would increase the chance of lower prices. The bulls want a strong reversal up today. They want Friday to be a bear trap. The odds still favor lower prices even if the bulls get a bounce this week.<p>Because Friday was a sell climax, there will probably be at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading today that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. Because Friday was so extreme, there is an increased chance that today will be a trading range day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EURUSD-Forex-testing-neckline-of-head-and-shoulders-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-3-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex testing neckline of head and shoulders top\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly on Friday from the bottom of a 4 month trading range. The bulls see a double bottom with the November 29 low.<p>However, the bear channel was tight. Also, on the weekly chart (I showed it on my<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Weekend Update (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/market-analysis/january-is-minor-sell-signal-emini-monthly-chart/\" target=\"_blank\">Weekend Update</a>), the 4 week selloff had only one leg down. Every other swing up and down for almost 2 years had at least 2 legs. Consequently, traders should expect a test of the November low within a couple weeks before there is a move back up to the top of the range.<p>It is important to note that last week formed a strong buy signal bar at support on the weekly chart. Today’s high came to within a fraction of a pip of last week’s high, but failed to trigger the buy signal. But after 4 consecutive bear bars, the 1st reversal up will probably be minor.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly on Friday but sold off overnight. There was a 6 hour trading range early in today’s session, a 20 pip bear breakout, and now a 2nd trading range. Today is therefore so far a Bear Trending Trading Range Day.<p>While it is a bear trend day, most of the time has been within trading ranges. This trading range price action usually limits how far the day will go from this point.<p>The bears want another leg down. But today has already retraced half of Friday. Also, today’s bars are small and the 2 trading ranges were only about 10 pips tall. That reduces the chance of much lower prices.<p>The bulls would like a reversal back up into the upper range. Today would then be back at last week’s high. That would increase the chance of triggering the weekly buy signal today or tomorrow.<p>With the small bars and tight ranges today, today will probably not go far up or down. There is a chance of a brief 20 pip breakout up or down. Day traders will scalp unless there is a surprisingly strong breakout, which is unlikely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-buy-climax-and-sell-climax-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax and sell climax then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>Today rallied strongly on the open. It was a strong enough rally to be a Bull Major Surprise breakout. That made a bear trend day unlikely.<p>However, there was a bear trend after the 1st hour. It was a bear leg in what became a trading range day. It was strong enough to make a bull trend unlikely. With both a both and bear trend unlikely, the day entered a trading range.<p>Today was an inside day on the daily chart and the Emini has been sideways for 6 days. It is in Breakout Mode.<p>Since a 5% correction is likely, this week will probably trade below the January low. That would trigger the monthly sell signal. But after 4 strong months up, the sell signal is minor. Consequently, the bears will probably get a 5 – 10% pullback over the next 2 weeks to 2 months and then the bulls will buy for a test of the all-time high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This trading range price action usually limits how far the day will go from this point.<p>The bears want another leg down. But today has already retraced half of Friday. Also, today’s bars are small and the 2 trading ranges were only about 10 pips tall. That reduces the chance of much lower prices.<p>The bulls would like a reversal back up into the upper range. Today would then be back at last week’s high. That would increase the chance of triggering the weekly buy signal today or tomorrow.<p>With the small bars and tight ranges today, today will probably not go far up or down. There is a chance of a brief 20 pip breakout up or down. Day traders will scalp unless there is a surprisingly strong breakout, which is unlikely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-buy-climax-and-sell-climax-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax and sell climax then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was a strong enough rally to be a Bull Major Surprise breakout. That made a bear trend day unlikely.<p>However, there was a bear trend after the 1st hour. It was a bear leg in what became a trading range day. It was strong enough to make a bull trend unlikely. With both a both and bear trend unlikely, the day entered a trading range.<p>Today was an inside day on the daily chart and the Emini has been sideways for 6 days. It is in Breakout Mode.<p>Since a 5% correction is likely, this week will probably trade below the January low. That would trigger the monthly sell signal. But after 4 strong months up, the sell signal is minor. Consequently, the bears will probably get a 5 – 10% pullback over the next 2 weeks to 2 months and then the bulls will buy for a test of the all-time high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was therefore an inside day.<p>Furthermore, it was the 6th day in a developing trading range. It is therefore a Breakout Mode bar. If the bulls get 2 or 3 big bull days and a couple closes above 3300, traders will conclude that the bull trend has resumed.<p>I have been saying for several weeks that 3300 has been a magnet. The Emini might have to get there before traders decide whether the bull trend will resume or there will be a 2nd leg down and a 5% correction. Without a strong break back above 3300, the odd still favor a 5% correction.<p>The swings up and down have been big. Day traders will continue to look for swing trades, even though the daily chart is in a 6 day tight trading range.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 42 points in the Globex session. There will therefore be a big gap up today. Traders expect another test of 3300 before they will decide if the correction has ended or if there will be a 2nd leg down and a 5% pullback.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above its 20 bar EMA on the 5 minute chart. Traders are hesitant to pay far above the average price. Therefore, most days that have a big gap up enter an early trading range.<p>If there is a trading range for the at hour or two, the bears look for a wedge rally or double top and then a swing down. However, the bulls look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom near the EMA.<p>Also, a trading range open is a sign of neutrality. It reduces the chance of a relentless trend up or down once there is a breakout.<p>There is a 20% chance of a very strong trend up or down from the open. Up is slightly more likely because 3300 is an important magnet and it will probably be at least 10 points above the open. Also, if there is a strong trend after a big gap up, a bull trend is slightly more likely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-buy-climax-and-sell-climax-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-4.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax and sell climax then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, the bear channel was tight and the weekly chart (not shown) has 4 consecutive bear bars. This makes the rally more likely a pullback from the 4 week selloff and not the start of a swing up to the top of the 6 month trading range.<p>Friday’s rally was strong. Furthermore, it was the 2nd consecutive bull day. There will probably be at least a small 2nd leg up within a week. But it will probably not reach the top of the 6 month trading range.<h3>Bulls want a test of the January low</h3><p>Most bulls want to see a test of last week’s low and then a 2nd reversal up. If they get that within the next couple weeks, they will be more willing to buy. They would then have a better chance of a test of the January 16 lower high or the January 1 top of the trading range.<p>If the EURUSD breaks strongly below that low, the bulls will buy a reversal up from around the October low. Currently, it is more likely that yesterday’s reversal down will not lead to a resumption of the 4 week bear trend. But the bulls really want some kind of a double bottom after the 4 week selloff.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off 25 pips overnight. However, it did not fall below yesterday’s low.<p>Traders are wondering if there will be a small 2nd leg up after Friday’s rally before a test down to the January low. Also, Friday’s rally was strong enough to make a least a small 2nd leg up likely. Consequently, the selloff from yesterday’s high will probably form a higher low and lead to another test of Friday’s high.<p>But that higher low will probably come from below yesterday’s low. Legs in trading ranges usually go past support or resistance before reversing.<p>Also, the higher low might not come today. The overnight range and the bars have been small. In addition, since at least a small 2nd leg up this week is likely, there are probably buyers not far below yesterday’s low. This makes a big bear day unlikely. Yesterday’s big selloff makes a big bull day unlikely. Traders therefore expect today to stay quiet and they will continue to look for 10 – 20 pips scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-wedge-rally-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge rally then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then rallied in a Small Pullback Bull Trend and broke above the 3300 Big Round Number. There was a parabolic wedge within a wedge, and that led to a reversal down. It oscillated around 3300 for the remainder of the day and closed 2 ticks below it.<p>I have talked about 3300 many times over the past few weeks. I have said that the Emini would probably have to test it before the bears could get down to a 5% correction. It has been important support and resistance for several weeks. If instead the bulls get consecutive closes on the daily chart above 3300, the bull trend will probably continue up to a new high.<p>I will be away at the MoneyShow in Orlando through the weekend and will not write any updates until Monday.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The rally to the new high was strong enough to make one more leg up likely.<p>The bulls might want a test down to the January 29 breakout point before buying again. That high is 3292.75. If there is a test there and a reversal up, the rally would be a 3rd leg up. That could lead to a wedge top and another test of the January 31 low.<p>The Emini has had trading range price action since late December. While it made a new high last week, the 2 week rally is probably a bull leg in what will be in hindsight a trading range. That means that traders should expect a bear leg in the trading range to begin within a couple weeks.<p>The daily chart is still in a bull trend. But because it is now also likely in a trading range, the odds favor a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin by the end of next week. The Emini still might get a 5 – 10% pullback before going much higher.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 10 points in the Globex session. It might have to drift down to below the January 29 high of 3292.75 before there is another leg up. There can be swings up and down as the Emini works lower, but a strong move up or down is not likely today.<p>Friday was a small bear day. Its bear body makes Friday a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. Consequently, there might be more sellers than buyers above its high. This reduces the chance of a rally today to above Friday’s high.<p>Thursday was not a strong sell signal bar. Friday was a small bear day will a prominent tail below. Traders see it as a weak entry bar for the bears.<p>With the past 2 days not being particularly good for the bulls or the bears, traders are expecting trading range price action today. This means that they expect that any trend lasting a few hours will evolve into a trading range or reverse into an opposite trend for a few hours. It reduces the chance of a big trend up or down today.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-double-bottom-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-10.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EURUSD.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-10-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD weekly Forex chart shows gap below\"></a></figure><p>The weekly chart of the EURUSD Forex market Has been in a bear trend for 2 years. Yet, it is still above the 2017 low. Therefore, this 2 year bear channel is probably a bull flag in the bull trend that began in 2017.<p>The bear channel has reversed every few weeks for 20 months. Many of the rallies and selloffs have been strong, but none has ended the bear channel. This is even true of last month’s breakout above the bear trend line. All it did was make the channel a little wider. It did not end the bear trend. The weekly chart is now testing the October low.<h3>1.08 is a magnet below</h3><p>There are several magnets below the October low and around 1.08. The closer the EURUSD gets to them, the more likely it will not be able to escape the magnetic pull. Consequently, the chart might have to reach all of them before the bears will take final profits and the bulls will buy aggressively enough to begin a rally that lasts more than a couple months.<p>There was a gap up 2 years ago on the weekly chart, which is rare and a magnet. The bottom of the gap is the April 21, 2017 high of 1.0777. There are also 2 measured move targets from double top bear flags in the 2 year bear trend.<p>All 3 of these support levels are very close to the support of the 1.08 Big Round Number. That might be where the chart has to go before the bear trend finally ends.<h3>Sell climax on the daily chart</h3><p>On the daily chart (not shown), Friday was a big day and it was the 5th consecutive bear bar. That is extreme selling and it will probably attract some profit taking early this week. Consequently, day traders will begin to look to buy reversals up from prior lows on the 5 minute chart.<p>They will continue to sell, but will soon switch to selling 50 – 100 pip rallies. In addition, they will start taking profits around prior lows. This will probably result in a trading range for at least a couple days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market was in a 15 pip range overnight. However, the bears started a small breakout 20 minutes ago.<p>The bears on the 60 minute chart are getting exhausted and are becoming resistant to selling at the low. The 60 minute chart is still in a bear trend, but it is now also in a trading range. Also, the range is late in a bear trend. It is therefore a likely Final Bear Flag. That means that traders will look to buy a reversal up from a bear breakout. They expect at least a few sideways days to begin this week.<p>The selloff that began a few minutes ago is strong enough to have at least a small 2nd leg down. But, day traders will not expect to make more than 30 pips on any move for at least a few days. The sell climax will probably evolve into a trading range today or tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-outside-up-day-to-a-new-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day to a new all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Consequently, it is a magnet below. The Emini might have to test it before it can go much higher.<p>A reversal down from a new high would create a wedge top over the past 3 weeks.

The rally to the new high was strong enough to make one more leg up likely.<p>The bulls might want a test down to the January 29 breakout point before buying again. That high is 3292.75. If there is a test there and a reversal up, the rally would be a 3rd leg up. That could lead to a wedge top and another test of the January 31 low.<p>The Emini has had trading range price action since late December. While it made a new high last week, the 2 week rally is probably a bull leg in what will be in hindsight a trading range. That means that traders should expect a bear leg in the trading range to begin within a couple weeks.<p>The daily chart is still in a bull trend. But because it is now also likely in a trading range, the odds favor a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin by the end of next week. The Emini still might get a 5 – 10% pullback before going much higher.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 10 points in the Globex session. It might have to drift down to below the January 29 high of 3292.75 before there is another leg up. There can be swings up and down as the Emini works lower, but a strong move up or down is not likely today.<p>Friday was a small bear day. Its bear body makes Friday a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. Consequently, there might be more sellers than buyers above its high. This reduces the chance of a rally today to above Friday’s high.<p>Thursday was not a strong sell signal bar. Friday was a small bear day will a prominent tail below. Traders see it as a weak entry bar for the bears.<p>With the past 2 days not being particularly good for the bulls or the bears, traders are expecting trading range price action today. This means that they expect that any trend lasting a few hours will evolve into a trading range or reverse into an opposite trend for a few hours. It reduces the chance of a big trend up or down today.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-double-bottom-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-10.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Yet, it is still above the 2017 low. Therefore, this 2 year bear channel is probably a bull flag in the bull trend that began in 2017.<p>The bear channel has reversed every few weeks for 20 months. Many of the rallies and selloffs have been strong, but none has ended the bear channel. This is even true of last month’s breakout above the bear trend line. All it did was make the channel a little wider. It did not end the bear trend. The weekly chart is now testing the October low.<h3>1.08 is a magnet below</h3><p>There are several magnets below the October low and around 1.08. The closer the EURUSD gets to them, the more likely it will not be able to escape the magnetic pull. Consequently, the chart might have to reach all of them before the bears will take final profits and the bulls will buy aggressively enough to begin a rally that lasts more than a couple months.<p>There was a gap up 2 years ago on the weekly chart, which is rare and a magnet. The bottom of the gap is the April 21, 2017 high of 1.0777. There are also 2 measured move targets from double top bear flags in the 2 year bear trend.<p>All 3 of these support levels are very close to the support of the 1.08 Big Round Number. That might be where the chart has to go before the bear trend finally ends.<h3>Sell climax on the daily chart</h3><p>On the daily chart (not shown), Friday was a big day and it was the 5th consecutive bear bar. That is extreme selling and it will probably attract some profit taking early this week. Consequently, day traders will begin to look to buy reversals up from prior lows on the 5 minute chart.<p>They will continue to sell, but will soon switch to selling 50 – 100 pip rallies. In addition, they will start taking profits around prior lows. This will probably result in a trading range for at least a couple days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market was in a 15 pip range overnight. However, the bears started a small breakout 20 minutes ago.<p>The bears on the 60 minute chart are getting exhausted and are becoming resistant to selling at the low. The 60 minute chart is still in a bear trend, but it is now also in a trading range. Also, the range is late in a bear trend. It is therefore a likely Final Bear Flag. That means that traders will look to buy a reversal up from a bear breakout. They expect at least a few sideways days to begin this week.<p>The selloff that began a few minutes ago is strong enough to have at least a small 2nd leg down.

It was therefore an outside up day. The Emini then entered a tight trading range, as it usually does once it goes outside up. The bulls got trend resumption up and the Emini closed at a new all-time high. There is no top and traders expect higher prices.<p>But, it is important to understand that the Emini might be in a trading range on the daily chart that began with the start of 2020. The current rally would then be a bull leg in a trading range rather than a resumption of the bull trend.<p>If so, a bear leg will follow. A reversal down would probably test the January low within a month or two. If there is a reversal, traders will be back to wondering if it will lead to a 5 – 10% correction.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. It might therefore gap above yesterday’s high.<p>Yesterday was a big day and the Emini might be in a trading range since Christmas. If it is, today will probably be a bad follow-through day for the bulls. That means a small day or even a bear day.<p>This is important. If there is no follow-through buying today, it would increase the chance that the 2 week rally is just a bull leg in a trading range that began around Christmas. But if today is another big bull day, it will make traders expect a measured move up based on the high of the January range.<p>The January selloff was strong enough to make a trading range slightly more likely. Consequently, today will probably not be another big bull day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-outside-up-day-to-a-new-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-11.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day to a new all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is just above the October low. That is the bottom of the 6 month trading range and of the 2 year bear trend.<p>The selling has been extreme and is it therefore climactic. Also, the EURUSD is near support. That typically will attract some profit-taking. Consequently, there will probably be a 2 – 3 day bounce starting this week.<p>However, when a selloff is surprisingly strong like this, there is usually at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. Therefore the 1st reversal up will likely not last more than a week or two. Traders will want to see at least a micro double bottom before they look for a 2 – 4 week reversal up.<p>It is important to remember what I have been saying for many months. There is a gap on the daily and weekly charts above the April 7, 2017 high of 1.0777. Since most gaps fill, this 2 year bear trend might not end until it closes that gap.<p>There is one other important point. Whether or not the sell continues down to below 1.08, every new low for 2 years reversed up for a few weeks within a couple weeks after making a new low. Therefore the October low is important support.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke below 1.09 over the past hour. It is within 20 pips of the October low, which is support. Since the daily chart is in a sell climax that is now extreme, there will probably be a 2 – 3 day 100 pip bounce starting this week.<p>Day traders will start to look for a reversal up on the 5 minute and 60 minute charts to trade that bounce. Also, because the EURUSD is overdone and near support, the bears will probably begin to take profits this week.<p>Can today break strongly below the October low and be another big bear trend day? Yes, but sideways to up is more likely. If it does, the bears will probably begin to take profits tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-parabolic-wedge-top-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge top and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The day reversed down from the top of the wedge bull channel on the daily chart and closed near the low. It is a sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The bears believe that the 2 week rally was just a bull leg in a 6 week trading range. However, the bulls are hoping that the 6 month bull trend is resuming. Without some more bull bars this week, the odds are that the Emini will test the January low within a couple months.<p>Will tomorrow be a big bear day? That would increase the chances for the bear. Because the daily chart has probably been in a trading range since Christmas, it is more likely that nothing will be as clear as traders want. Traders expect continued confusion. The bears therefore might need a micro double top before they can begin a selloff to the January low.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It sold off to below Monday’s high and closed the gap.<p>Since yesterday had a bear body on the daily chart, it is a sell signal bar for today. There is a wedge top and a higher high major trend reversal. However, if the bears get a reversal down, it will probably lead to a continuation of the 6 week trading range that began around Christmas and not a bear trend.<p>A trading range disappoints bulls and bears. Consequently, tomorrow will probably not be a strong bear day. Most days will have a lot of trading range price action.<p>If the Emini in fact has been in a trading range since Christmas, the target for the bears would be the bottom of the range. That would be about a 5% pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. It will probably break above yesterday’s bear channel on the open. Yesterday was likely a bull flag from Monday’s rally.<p>There is no nearby resistance and the bull trend on the daily and weekly charts are strong. That slightly increases the chance of a bull trend day.<p>The bears will want a double top with yesterday’s high. But today is breaking above a bull flag (yesterday’s bear channel). That makes a bear trend less likely.<p>Since yesterday was a protracted selloff, there is an increased chance of trading range trading today. But there is a bullish bias from the break above the bull flag.<p>Can the 2 week rally continue much higher? If the bulls get 2 or 3 more bull bars, then the Emini is probably resuming its bull trend. Without that, the Emini is more likely at or near the top of a 6 week trading range. That means traders will look for a bear leg to begin within the next several weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-parabolic-wedge-top-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-12.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge top and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That low is the bottom of the 6 month trading range and the 2 year bear trend. It is major support. A small bull bar is not a strong enough foundation to build a rally that will reverse 6 big bear days.<p>Yesterday was a sign of minor profit-taking and not the end of the 6 week bear trend. The bulls typically need at least a small double bottom before they can get more than a 3 day rally.<p>Also, there are several magnets below around the 1.08 Big Round Number. There are 2 measured move targets there and a gap from April 2017. The EURUSD is close enough to those magnets so that it will probably not be able to escape their magnetic pull.<p>However, traders have bought every new low for 2 years. This has resulted in at least a 2 week, 200 pip rally every time. Consequently, the bulls might get one or two more 200 pip rallies before the bears reach 1.08.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small range overnight. It did not trigger the buy signal on the daily chart. It turned down from 1 pip below yesterday’s high.<p>Because the daily chart is so oversold, there is an increased chance of a strong short covering rally at any time. Also, the October low is a magnet that is only 12 pips below yesterday’s low. That increases the chance of s surprisingly strong breakout below that support.<p>But what is most likely? Yesterday was a small sideways day. Today is also a small sideways day. The bears are probably exhausted and the bulls do not believe that yesterday is a reliable bottom.

It sold off to below Monday’s high and closed the gap.<p>Since yesterday had a bear body on the daily chart, it is a sell signal bar for today. There is a wedge top and a higher high major trend reversal. However, if the bears get a reversal down, it will probably lead to a continuation of the 6 week trading range that began around Christmas and not a bear trend.<p>A trading range disappoints bulls and bears. Consequently, tomorrow will probably not be a strong bear day. Most days will have a lot of trading range price action.<p>If the Emini in fact has been in a trading range since Christmas, the target for the bears would be the bottom of the range. That would be about a 5% pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. It will probably break above yesterday’s bear channel on the open. Yesterday was likely a bull flag from Monday’s rally.<p>There is no nearby resistance and the bull trend on the daily and weekly charts are strong. That slightly increases the chance of a bull trend day.<p>The bears will want a double top with yesterday’s high. But today is breaking above a bull flag (yesterday’s bear channel). That makes a bear trend less likely.<p>Since yesterday was a protracted selloff, there is an increased chance of trading range trading today. But there is a bullish bias from the break above the bull flag.<p>Can the 2 week rally continue much higher? If the bulls get 2 or 3 more bull bars, then the Emini is probably resuming its bull trend. Without that, the Emini is more likely at or near the top of a 6 week trading range. That means traders will look for a bear leg to begin within the next several weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-parabolic-wedge-top-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-12.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge top and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That low is the bottom of the 6 month trading range and the 2 year bear trend. It is major support. A small bull bar is not a strong enough foundation to build a rally that will reverse 6 big bear days.<p>Yesterday was a sign of minor profit-taking and not the end of the 6 week bear trend. The bulls typically need at least a small double bottom before they can get more than a 3 day rally.<p>Also, there are several magnets below around the 1.08 Big Round Number. There are 2 measured move targets there and a gap from April 2017. The EURUSD is close enough to those magnets so that it will probably not be able to escape their magnetic pull.<p>However, traders have bought every new low for 2 years. This has resulted in at least a 2 week, 200 pip rally every time. Consequently, the bulls might get one or two more 200 pip rallies before the bears reach 1.08.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small range overnight. It did not trigger the buy signal on the daily chart. It turned down from 1 pip below yesterday’s high.<p>Because the daily chart is so oversold, there is an increased chance of a strong short covering rally at any time. Also, the October low is a magnet that is only 12 pips below yesterday’s low. That increases the chance of s surprisingly strong breakout below that support.<p>But what is most likely?

The bulls got a late rally into the close.<p>There is a wedge top on the daily chart. The 4% selloff in January makes it possible that this rally is a bull leg in what will be a trading range that began around Christmas. Traders expect that there might be a test of the January low by the end of March.<p>However, if the bulls get a couple closes above 3400, the rally might reach the Leg 1 = Leg 2 target of 3468 on the weekly chart. That would also be around a measured move up based on the height of the January range.<h3>Bull leg in trading range or resumption of bull trend?</h3><p>Traders are deciding whether the 2 week rally is a leg up in a trading range that began at Christmas or a resumption of the 5 month bull trend. If the bulls get a couple closes above 3400, the odds will favor a bull trend.<p>But if the bears get a reversal down over the next few days, traders will look for a test of the January low by the end of March. Currently, the bear case is slightly more likely.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 17 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap down below yesterday’s low. Most gaps are minor and small gaps usually close before the end of the day.<p>But since the Emini might be forming the top of a 2 month trading range, there is an increased chance of a Bear Surprise Day. That is a surprisingly big bear day, which often will lead to follow-through selling.<p>Is there also an increased chance of a big bull day? Probably not. There is uncertainty. When that is the case and the Emini has rallied for a couple weeks, rallies attract sellers. That reduces the chance of a Bull Surprise from this level.<p>There has been a lot of trading range trading for a couple of weeks. This was especially true yesterday. That increases the chance or more trading range trading today. But traders should always be ready for a relentless trend day up or down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-wedge-bull-flag-and-then-trading-range-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-13.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bull flag and then trading range with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That was the low in the 2 year bear trend and the bottom of the 6 month trading range.<p>Traders bought every prior new low for 2 years and got a 2 – 3 week, 200 – 300 pip rally. They expect the bears to take profits soon, as they have done in the past. This especially true since today fell just below the measured move target from the January head and shoulders top.<p>The bulls tried to get a reversal up 2 days ago and failed. When that happens in a sell climax and there is another big bear bar, like yesterday, there is usually a 2nd attempt within 2 – 3 days. Consequently, traders will be looking for a reversal up this week.<h3>Short covering rally likely soon</h3><p>If the bears take profits, they will not look to sell again 2 – 3 days later. Instead, they usually wait for about 10 days. They want to see if the bulls can get a reversal up. The bears usually will give the bulls 2 chances. The result is typically a 2 legged rally lasting about 10 days and testing resistance. That means the 20 day EMA and possibly the neck line of the head and shoulders top around 1.10.<p>There is no reversal yet and therefore traders expect at least slightly lower prices. The EURUSD might fall to the next support at around 1.08 before the short covering begins. But it usually begins within 3 days of the 1st attempt, which was Tuesday. Therefore there is an increased chance of a bull trend reversal bar this week and then the start of a 2 week rally.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off 35 pips over the past 2 hours to below the neck line of the January head and shoulders top. Remember, there are still magnets below at around 1.08 and the 2 week sell climax has been strong. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a plunge down to that support.<p>However, Tuesday’s reversal attempt on the daily chart increases the chance of a 1 – 2 week rally beginning within the next few days. Therefore, if the bulls get a reversal up, they will be more willing to swing trade part of their position.<p>The overnight range has been small. That reduces the chance of a big trend today. But the bulls will try to get a reversal up and a close above the open. They want today or tomorrow to have a bull body on the daily chart and a close near the high. If they get it, that bull trend reversal bar will increase the chance of a couple weeks of short covering.<p>The bears want to close the gap on the daily chart by falling below 1.0777. But Tuesday’s bull body makes it more likely that there will be a short-covering rally 1st.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-double-bottom-then-outside-up-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom then outside up trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was an outside up day and it formed another all-time high. There was a midday reversal down after a wedge rally and the Emini closed in the middle of its range. It formed a trending trading range day.<p>The rally since January 29 is in a wedge. But there is no top yet and therefore traders continue to expect higher prices.<p>Tomorrow is Friday, but there is no nearby weekly support or resistance. The bulls will simply try to get the week to close near the high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Consequently, there is an increased chance of a plunge down to that support.<p>However, Tuesday’s reversal attempt on the daily chart increases the chance of a 1 – 2 week rally beginning within the next few days. Therefore, if the bulls get a reversal up, they will be more willing to swing trade part of their position.<p>The overnight range has been small. That reduces the chance of a big trend today. But the bulls will try to get a reversal up and a close above the open. They want today or tomorrow to have a bull body on the daily chart and a close near the high. If they get it, that bull trend reversal bar will increase the chance of a couple weeks of short covering.<p>The bears want to close the gap on the daily chart by falling below 1.0777. But Tuesday’s bull body makes it more likely that there will be a short-covering rally 1st.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-double-bottom-then-outside-up-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom then outside up trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was an outside up day and it formed another all-time high. There was a midday reversal down after a wedge rally and the Emini closed in the middle of its range. It formed a trending trading range day.<p>The rally since January 29 is in a wedge. But there is no top yet and therefore traders continue to expect higher prices.<p>Tomorrow is Friday, but there is no nearby weekly support or resistance.

However, it sold off to close in the middle of the day’s range.<p>The bulls hope that the 2 week rally is a resumption of the 4 month bull trend. If they keep getting bull bars closing near their highs, the odds will shift in favor of the rally reaching the weekly chart’s Leg 1 = Leg 2 target at 3468.<p>However, there is currently an equal chance that it is a bull leg in a trading range than began around Christmas. The bears see the rally as a wedge since the January 29 high. If so, the Emini will test the January low at the bottom of the range by the end of March.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. However, there are no nearby targets. Therefore the fight will be over whether or not the week closes on its high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 5 points in the Globex session. It will probably open in or near yesterday’s 5 hour trading range. Since markets tend to continue what they have been doing, there is an increased chance of an early trading range.<p>If that happens, today would likely be another mostly sideways day. Also, with Monday being a holiday, traders begin to think about waiting for Tuesday before aggressively trading again. That further reduces the chance of a big trend day.<p>The daily chart is in a buy climax. Traders need to be ready for a Surprise Day up or down at any time.<p>Most bars on the weekly chart have had conspicuous tails on top. This probably increases the chance of today closing down from this week’s high by 10 or more points.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-double-bottom-then-outside-up-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-14.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom then outside up trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders are wondering if the selloff was just a sell vacuum test of support or a move down to fill the April 2017 gap.<p>A breakout below major support usually has a pullback above that support. Also, that small bull day from 3 days ago represents minor profit taking. If today closes around its open or near its high, that would be a sign of a 2nd profit taking attempt.<p>When there is a sell climax like this and consecutive attempts at profit taking, the odds shift in favor of a bounce. The first target is a move above the October low.<p>Even though the 1st rally will be minor, this sell climax is extreme. The short covering could last a couple weeks and test the 20 day EMA. But, the bulls need a reversal day. Today or a day next week could be that day.<p>While the bulls might get a 2 week rally soon, this low is near the gap above the April 2017 high. The EURUSD probably cannot escape the magnetic pull of that support. Therefore, the EURUSD will likely close that gap within a month.<h3>Double bottom with October low, but minor reversal</h3><p>Finally, the bulls want the short covering rally to become a bull trend reversal. They see a lower low double bottom with the October low. However, the 1st reversal up from a sell climax is usually minor. Traders like to see at least a small double bottom before concluding that the bulls have a chance of a major reversal.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 25 pip trading range overnight. The bars are small and day traders have been looking for 10 pip scalps.<p>Tuesday was a small short covering day. Because there is usually a 2nd attempt at profit taking in a sell climax within a few days after the 1st attempt, traders are looking for a short covering rally to begin within a few days. This could result in several strong bull trend days.<p>But, there is no sign of a trend so far today. Day traders will continue to scalp unless there is a strong breakout up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-trading-range-and-close-on-the-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range and close on the high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was not a strong bear day.<p>The Emini formed a bear inside day on the daily chart. Since yesterday was an outside day, there today is now an ioi sell signal bar for Monday. Because the daily chart is in a bull trend and today closed on its high, the odds favor higher prices on Tuesday (Monday is a holiday).<p>The bears want the 2nd half of February to reverse the 1st half. This would then be similar to January. The bulls, however, are hoping that the 4 month Small Pullback Bull Trend is resuming.

However, there is currently only a 30% chance that February will reverse back down to the low of the month in the final 2 weeks.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market has been sideways for 6 months and there is no sign that it is about to break out.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is in a sell climax. A 2 week short covering rally will probably begin within a week or two.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Sideways to up for another couple months</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-ioi-breakout-mode-setup.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-15.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has ioi breakout mode setup\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures had an inside bar this week on the weekly chart. Last week was an outside bar. This is therefore an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern.<p>A Breakout Mode pattern has about a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the first breakout will reverse.<p>The bulls see the 2 big bull bars at the end of January as a breakout above a 4 month bull flag. For them, the past 2 weeks are forming a pullback from that breakout. They expect the bull trend to resume either next week or the following week. They would like a break far above the August all-time high.<p>However,<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"I said many times that Americans will not accept negative interest rates (opens in a new tab)\">I said many times that Americans will not accept negative interest rates</a>. If this rally continues much higher, that is what Americans will be facing. Politicians know that and they will prevent it from happening. How? They could print money to create inflation or they could greatly increase the sale of bonds. That supply would drive the price down. There are other things they could do as well.<h3>9 year nested wedge top</h3><p>It is important to note that the bond market formed a 9 year nested wedge top on the monthly chart in July 2016. The current rally is testing that high. A test of a wedge top happens about half of the time before there is a reversal down.<p>The bulls want a strong break above the wedge top and then a measured move up based on the height of the 4 year range. There would normally be a 50% chance for the bulls. But this is not normal. Americans will not tolerate much lower interest rates. Consequently, there is probably less than a 40% chance that the 2019 rally will continue far above the 2016 high.<p>The bond market has been in a bull trend for 30 years on the monthly chart. Once it reverses, it will probably be in a bear trend for a decade or two. Since this a monthly chart, the transition from a bull trend to a bear trend can take many years. So far, the market has been sideways for almost 4 years. There is no reversal yet. But there is no clear resumption of the 30 year bull trend either.<h3>Weak bull flag on the monthly chart</h3><p>The monthly chart had 4 consecutive bear bars since September after the 2019 buy climax. Even though January was a big bull bar, it would be unusual for a bull breakout above 4 bear bars after a buy climax to lead to a resumption of the bull trend. More often, the rally lasts 1 – 3 bars (here, months) and turns down from around the prior high.<p>January was a surprisingly big bull bar on the monthly chart. A bull Surprise Bar typically will have at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. As a result, even though February so far is a bear bar, the bond market will probably be sideways to up for at least another month or two. This is true even if March trades below the February low.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Sell climax will likely lead to some short covering</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-strong-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-15-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has strong bear breakout\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart has sold off strongly for the past 2 weeks. It broke below the October low, which was both the bottom of the 2 year bear trend and the 6 month trading range.<h3>April 2017 gap at 1.0777 is magnet below</h3><p>For 6 months, I have mentioned that the 1.08 is an important magnet. The biggest reason is that there is a gap above the a April 7, 2017 high of 1.0777 on the daily can weekly chart.<p>Open gaps are rare in the Forex market. Most gaps close. The EURUSD is now near enough to this gap to make it likely that it will test the gap and probably close it. But because the daily chart is so oversold, there will probably be a bounce first.<p>There are other magnets around that gap. 1.08 is a Big Round Number and therefore a magnet. In addition, there were a couple double top bear flags over the past 2 years with measured move targets around 1.08.<h3>EURUSD might test 2017 bottom of bull trend or even par (1.0000)</h3><p>Will the selloff continue down to below the January 2017 low of 1.0340? That was the start of a strong bull trend. The bulls want to keep this selloff from falling below that low. They would then view this selloff as just a deep bull flag pullback from the rally to February 2018.<p>The bears, however, not only want a break below the bull trend low, they want the EURUSD to fall to par (1.0000). The momentum down on the weekly chart is strong enough to get there. But trends resist change. Therefore it is still more likely that the 2 year selloff will end before falling below the 2017 start of the bull trend.<p>And even if it falls below, it would then be at the bottom of a 6 year trading range. That will likely result in many months of sideways trading or even a reversal up.<h3>Daily chart should bounce within 2 weeks</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-has-strong-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-15-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart has strong bear breakout\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart has been in an unusually strong bear breakout for 2 weeks. However, it is important to note that the bulls formed a small bull reversal bar on Tuesday. While that might seem insignificant, it was a sign of early profit-taking.<p>When there is a bull bar in an extreme sell climax and then the selling resumes, there is usually a 2nd attempt to reverse up within a few bars. The bears will more aggressively take profits (short-covering) after that 2nd attempt. The bulls will buy as well.<p>Friday was a bear doji bar and a possible candidate for that 2nd attempt. However, most traders want to see a big bull bar closing on its high before they become confident that the bounce has begun. The selloff will probably continue at least a little more before the short covering rally begins.<p>After the bears take profits, they will not look to sell again just a few days later. If that was their plan, they would not have taken profits.<p>Once they take profits in an extreme sell climax, they know there is an increased risk of a reversal up into a bull trend. But traders also understand that the 1st reversal up is typically minor. They want to see some kind of double bottom before concluding that the trend has reversed.<p>The bears usually allow the bulls to make at least a couple attempts to create a bull trend reversal. If the bears sense that the bulls are failing twice, the bears begin to sell again. Therefore, a profit-taking rally after an extreme sell climax usually has at least 2 legs up and lasts about 10 or more bars.<h3>Double bottom with October low</h3><p>The bulls hope that this selloff is just a sell vacuum test of the October low. They want a rally up from here. That would then be a lower low double bottom. Friday is a weak buy signal bar and the context is reasonable. The short covering rally might be underway, but most traders want to see one or more big bull bars closing on their highs.<p>The bulls want a violent reversal up, similar to the one in the stock market after Christmas 2018 crash. However, that rarely happens. The 1st reversal up from a sell climax is typically minor.<p>Because this sell climax is extreme, the short covering could last a couple weeks. The bears typically sell again near some resistance. At a minimum, they would then expect a test of the low.<p>If the bulls then get a 2nd reversal up, that would be a double bottom with the sell climax low. They would then have a better chance of a bigger reversal up. Right now, the best they probably can get is a couple weeks of short covering, and then a test down or a resumption of the bear trend.<h3>How far up will a short-covering rally go?</h3><p>A short covering rally typically reaches some resistance level, like the 20 day EMA or a breakout point. A break below a major support level like the October low usually soon has a pullback to above that low. The next higher breakout point is the November low, which is just below the 1.10 Big Round Number.<p>Traders should expect a short covering rally to begin within a few days. It might have started on Friday, but most traders want to see a big bull bar before they become confident of a bounce.<p>Sometimes it results in the EURUSD going sideways for a week or two. But since this selling is so extreme and there are magnets about 150 pips above, the bear rally will probably go up to the EMA and maybe the November low.<p>Can this selloff continue down to par without more than a 2 – 3 day bounce? That would be unusual. Traders expect a short-covering rally to begin within the next week or so.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Breakout above sell signal bar</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-sell-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-15-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart breaking above sell signal bar\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;formed a bear reversal bar in January. However, instead of triggering the monthly sell signal by going below the January low, the Emini instead rallied to above the January high.<p>If February closes above the January high, February would then be a bull breakout bar. That would make higher prices likely in March. If March is up, April would probably be sideways to up as well. This is because March and April are historically the most bullish consecutive months of the year.<h3>Can February reverse down in the final 2 weeks?</h3><p>There is always a bear case. When there is a bear reversal bar, the next month also often has a big tail on top. If it does, there is then a micro double top, which is a sell signal.<p>For February to have a big tail on top, it has to rally and then sell off. It has rallied for the 1st half of the month. That tail on the top of the January candlestick increases the chance of a selloff in the 2nd half of February.<p>So that is the fight we will see over the next 2 weeks. Will the bulls get February to close above the January high, increasing the chance of higher prices in March? Or, will the bears get a reversal back down to the February low, creating a micro double top? The bears have a 30% chance of getting a reversal back to the February low by the end of the month. That would increase the chance of lower prices in March.<p>Because the 6 month bull trend is strong and the Emini has been in a bull trend for 10 years, the odds continue to favor at least slightly higher prices. But traders know that February might sell off in the final 2 weeks.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Breakout above January high, approaching Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move target</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-near-Leg-1-equals-Leg-2-measured-move-target.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-15-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart near Leg 1 equals Leg 2 measured move target\"></a></figure><p>The title of my January 18 report was, “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Emini 5% correction could begin in 3 weeks (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/market-analysis/emini-5-correction-could-begin-3-weeks/\" target=\"_blank\">Emini 5% correction could begin in 3 weeks</a>.” The selloff began a few days later. The reason why I said there would be a pullback was because of the consecutive big bull bars on the weekly chart in mid-January.<p>When there are consecutive big bull bars late in a bull trend, they attract profit-takers. The 1st target is the bottom of the 2 bull bars. The Emini fell 2 ticks below that target but then resumed back up. The selloff was a little more than 4%.<p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart once again has a pair of consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs. However, the 2 week selloff relieved some of the buy climax. The bulls have a better chance of at least slightly higher prices.<h3>Will the 2 week breakout succeed?</h3><p>There is a bull trend channel line just above this week’s high. Also, there is a Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move target above at 3468. Will the rally continue up to that target and the 3500 Big Round Number or will it test the January low?<p>The momentum up has been strong, but the Emini has been above the 20 week EMA for many bars. Also, January’s 4% selloff is a sign that the bears can be strong. Consequently, it is currently more likely that this rally will stall within the next couple of weeks.<p>Next week is important. This week broke above the January 22 previous high. If next week is also a bull bar, traders will expect higher prices over the next few weeks.<p>However, if next week is a bear bar, especially a bear bar closing near its low, traders will think that the 2 week breakout might fail. A bear bar would increase the chance of lower prices over the following week.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Resumption of bull trend or bull leg in developing trading range?</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-wedge-rally-to-near-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-15-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart wedge rally to near top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>Friday was an inside day after an outside day on the daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart. This is therefore an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. Since Friday had a bull body and the trend is up, a bull breakout is more likely. Furthermore, the bull body makes this a weak sell setup.<p>It is worth noting that the daily chart has had 3 pushes up that began with the January 29 high. The rally is therefore a wedge, which often leads to a reversal down. Since the bull channel is tight, this is a minor sell setup. The best the bears can probably get next week is a 2 – 3 day pullback. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices.<p>The bulls hope that the rally up from the January 31 low is another Small Pullback Bull Trend, like the 4 month rally from the October low. There is room to the top of the 5 month bull channel and that is a magnet above.<p>Also, the 2nd leg up to the February 6 high was strong enough to reset the count in the wedge rally. That could instead be a new 1st leg up. If so, traders hoping for a wedge top might get another brief leg up after a 1 – 2 day pullback from this week’s high (the new 2nd leg up in the wedge).<p>There are often several ways to draw wedge tops. No one knows in advance what the consensus choice it. But traders are aware that the Emini might get a wedge reversal down next week. A strong reversal down could continue down to the January low. If so, traders will conclude that the 2 week rally was just a bull leg in a trading range that began around Christmas. More likely, the Emini will be sideways to up again next week.<p>If there is a test of the January low in March and then a rally to a lower high, there would be a head and shoulders top. However, most head and shoulders tops do not lead to major trend reversals.<h3>Next week should provide useful information</h3><p>I know this is confusing. The important point is that traders are deciding if the 2 week rally is a resumption of the 4 month bull trend or just a bull leg in a trading range that began around Christmas.<p>There is no top yet. If the Emini gets a couple closes above 3400, then the bull trend is probably resuming. Traders will then look at other targets above, like the Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move target on the weekly chart at 3468.<p>However, if next week begins to reverse down, traders will suspect that the rally was just a bull leg in the 2 month trading range. They will look for a bear leg and a test of the bottom of the range. That is the January low. Therefore, next week’s behavior will give traders information that will help them choose between these 2 alternatives.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls hope that this is the resumption of the 4 month bull trend.<p>However, that 4% selloff was unusual. It increases the chance that the bears will soon try again. As a result, traders are less certain that the rally is a resumption of the bull trend. It might instead be a bull leg in a trading range that began around Christmas.<p>The rally has had 3 pushes up that began with the January 29 high. Therefore it is a wedge. But the 2nd leg up was strong enough to start the count over again. As a result, there might be one more brief new high before there is a test down.<p>Friday was a bear inside day after Thursday being an outside day. It is therefore an ioi buy and sell signal bar for today.<p>If there is selling this week, the bulls will look at it as a 1 – 3 day bull flag. They want the bull trend to resume quickly.<p>The bears want a reversal down from a wedge top. They would like the selling to grow into a bear leg in the January trading range and for it to continue down to the January low.<p>If this week gets a couple closes above 3400, the Emini will probably continue higher through the end of the month. But if there is a strong 2 – 3 day reversal down, traders will begin to wonder if February will be like January and completely reverse its early rally.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 12 points in the Globex session. It has been unable to get above the 3400 Big Round Number despite many attempts over the past 4 days. This increases the chance of a test down to the most recent buy climax low. That is the February 10 low of 3316.25.<p>Most of the trading over the past 4 days has been sideways. Day traders will continue to look for reversals every 2 – 3 hours. However, since the Emini is overbought and struggling at a resistance level, there is an increased chance of a big bear day at any time.<p>What about a big bull trend day? That is less likely because the daily chart is overbought.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-trading-range-and-close-on-the-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-18.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range and close on the high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

I have been saying for 6 months that this selloff might not end until it tests that high.<p>Furthermore, closing the gap does not have to be the end of the 2 year selloff. The January 2017 low is the 18 year low. There is no reason to believe that the EURUSD will hold above it or above par (1.00).<p>Markets have inertia. They tend to continue to do what they have been doing. The EURUSD has been going down for 2 years. Yes, it is now near major support. If there is going to be a major trend reversal up into a bull trend, it will probably come at major support, like the April 2017 gap or the January 2017 low. But until there is a reversal, there is no reversal. Traders should continue to expect lower prices.<h3>Minor profit taking soon</h3><p>The 3 week selloff is unusually strong. That means it is unsustainable. The stop for the bears is now far above. Many will want to reduce their risk. The easiest way is to take some profits. Traders should expect about a 150 – 200 pip short covering rally to begin within a week or so. Yesterday might be a 1 day Final Bear Flag. But traders want to see a strong buy signal bar before they begin to believe that the selling will stop for a couple weeks.<p>The 1st reversal up from a strong bear trend is typically minor. Consequently, even if the bulls get a 2 week, 200 pip rally, it will probably not be the start of a bull trend. If would likely lead to a test of the current low and a trading range or to a resumption of the bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off sharply over the past hour to just below the 1.08 Big Round Number. In addition, the low is in the gap above the April 17, 2017 high of 1.0777.<p>Most gaps on the daily chart close. But there is often a big bounce from just above the bottom of the gap. Also, sometimes, there is a trend reversal up from around a gap.<p>Friday was an inside day on the daily chart. It could therefore be a 1 day Final Bear Flag.<p>Even though the EURUSD on the 5 minute chart is testing the gap, there is no reversal yet. Traders do not yet know if the sell climax of the past hour is simply a sell vacuum test of support. If so, it could lead to a sharp short covering rally today or soon.<p>Less likely, the 3 week collapse will continue down to the 2017 low of 1.0340 without a 2 week short covering rally first.<p>The selling over the past 3 weeks has been unusually extremely. Traders should expect it to end this week. It can end with an evolution into a trading range or with a sharp reversal up. But until it ends, traders will continue to sell small rallies.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then reversed up from a wedge bottom. The rally stalled around the open of the day and the 60 minute EMA. Then the Emini went sideways into the close.<p>Today is a High 1 bull flag buy signal chart on the daily chart. Since it was a doji bar, it is a weak buy signal bar.<p>The Emini is in a 6 day tight trading range. It has been unable to break above 3400. While it still might within a week or so, it is likely to test the February 10 buy climax low within a couple weeks. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance of a test of the January low by the end of March.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders should expect about a 150 – 200 pip short covering rally to begin within a week or so. Yesterday might be a 1 day Final Bear Flag. But traders want to see a strong buy signal bar before they begin to believe that the selling will stop for a couple weeks.<p>The 1st reversal up from a strong bear trend is typically minor. Consequently, even if the bulls get a 2 week, 200 pip rally, it will probably not be the start of a bull trend. If would likely lead to a test of the current low and a trading range or to a resumption of the bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off sharply over the past hour to just below the 1.08 Big Round Number. In addition, the low is in the gap above the April 17, 2017 high of 1.0777.<p>Most gaps on the daily chart close. But there is often a big bounce from just above the bottom of the gap. Also, sometimes, there is a trend reversal up from around a gap.<p>Friday was an inside day on the daily chart. It could therefore be a 1 day Final Bear Flag.<p>Even though the EURUSD on the 5 minute chart is testing the gap, there is no reversal yet. Traders do not yet know if the sell climax of the past hour is simply a sell vacuum test of support. If so, it could lead to a sharp short covering rally today or soon.<p>Less likely, the 3 week collapse will continue down to the 2017 low of 1.0340 without a 2 week short covering rally first.<p>The selling over the past 3 weeks has been unusually extremely. Traders should expect it to end this week. It can end with an evolution into a trading range or with a sharp reversal up. But until it ends, traders will continue to sell small rallies.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then reversed up from a wedge bottom. The rally stalled around the open of the day and the 60 minute EMA. Then the Emini went sideways into the close.<p>Today is a High 1 bull flag buy signal chart on the daily chart. Since it was a doji bar, it is a weak buy signal bar.<p>The Emini is in a 6 day tight trading range. It has been unable to break above 3400. While it still might within a week or so, it is likely to test the February 10 buy climax low within a couple weeks. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance of a test of the January low by the end of March.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday was a 1 day pullback. It is High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today.<p>However, the Emini has stalled below the 3400 Big Round Number for 6 days. Also, yesterday was not a big bull bar closing on its high. In addition, the 3 week rally is forming a small wedge and that will likely lead to a pullback soon.<p>While the Emini might get a brief break above 3400 within a couple weeks, it will probably test the February 10 buy climax low by mid-March. Also, there is a 50% chance of a test of the January low by the end of March.<h3>Emini stalling at the 3400 Big Round Number</h3><p>The bulls want a strong break above the 3400 Big Round Number. However, the parabolic wedge rally on the daily chart and the 4% selloff in January make it equally likely that the 3 week rally is just a bull leg in a trading range that began around Christmas.<p>The Emini stalled for 4 days just below 3300 last month. It then broke above, but could not hold above. January then had a 4% selloff.<p>The current behavior is similar. At a minimum, the Emini will probably fall to the February 10 buy climax low within a couple weeks. But will it first break above 3400? We should find out over the next few days.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 9 points in the Globex session. It has been in a tight range for 5 days. Most days have had at least one reversal. Since markets tend to continue what they have been doing, traders will expect at least one reversal today as well.<p>A tight trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. The probability of the bull breakout is about the same as for a bear breakout. Traders are looking for a breakout. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a strong trend within the next few days. However, until one is clearly underway, day traders will continue to look for reversals.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-19.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is now in the gap above the April 7, 2017 high, which is an important support level. Was this selloff simply a test of that gap, or will it break below the 2017 low and continue down to par (1.00)?<p>The stop for the bears is now far above. To reduce risk, many will begin to take profits. A short covering rally after an extreme sell climax typically has 2 or more legs and lasts about 10 bars or more.<p>Today is the 3rd attempt in 7 days to stop the selling. There is therefore a parabolic wedge bottom, which often comes at the end of a sell climax.<p>If the bulls can get today to close near its high, today will be a reasonable buy signal bar for tomorrow. A break above a strong buy signal bar will make many bears take some profits.<p>In addition, bull scalpers will buy for a test up to above the most recent resistance. That is the October low. The rally also usually tests the 20 day EMA.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market fell 1 pip below yesterday’s low and reversed up. So far, the reversal has only been 15 pips.<p>Everyone knows that the odds favor profit taking soon. The bears want the trend to continue much lower before it begins.<p>However, the daily chart is at major support. Also, there is now a possible parabolic wedge sell climax on the daily chart. That often leads to a minor reversal up.<p>Consequently, the next few days are important. If the bears begin to buy back their shorts and the bulls start to buy for a bounce, today could have a bull body. That would be a possible low for the next couple weeks.<p>Therefore, the bulls will be more willing to buy today than they have been for 3 weeks. At a minimum, they want today to have a bull body on the daily chart. They would have a better chance of a bigger rally if today or tomorrow becomes a big bull day that closes on its high.<p>The bears today will sell rallies. Their minimum goal is to have today close below the open. They do not want a good looking buy signal bar on the daily chart. If there are successful, traders will expect at least slightly lower prices tomorrow and possibly for several days.<p>Since the bears are exhausted and are ready to buy back their shorts at any point, there is a reduced chance of a big bear day today. This is true even though the daily chart is in a strong bear trend.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was another trading range day.<p>The bulls want a strong break above 3400 and then a rally up to the 3468 Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move target.

The bulls want a strong breakout above the 3400 Big Round Number.<p>Yesterday got near that target. Traders expect it to get closer within a few days. Furthermore, they expect at least a small breakout above. If there is a big breakout with follow-through over the following days, the rally will probably continue up to the Leg 1 = Leg 2 target at 3468.<p>More likely, the Emini will begin to pull back to the February 10 low within a week. That is the bottom of the most recent leg up and therefore a magnet below.<p>Also, there is a 50% chance of a selloff down to the January low by the end of March. This 3 week rally looks more like it will end up as a bull leg in a trading range that began around Christmas than a resumption of last year’s bull trend.<p>Most recent days have had predominantly trading range price action. Traders will expect that again today and will look for at least one swing up and one swing down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 10 points in the Globex session. The Emini is overbought on the daily chart and there is also a parabolic wedge buy climax top on that chart. There is therefore an increased chance of several bear trend days within the next couple of weeks.<p>However, there is no reversal down yet and the Emini has been working higher. Can the bulls get a strong rally from here? While it is possible, if there is going to be several trend days, down is slightly more likely. But with the past 6 days having mostly trading range price action, traders will continue to bet on reversals until there is a strong breakout up or down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-20.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That high is the bottom of a gap on both the daily and weekly charts.<p>I have talked about that many times over the past 6 months as a possible magnet. Well, now we are here. Now what?<p>The bulls want a climactic reversal up and an end of the 2 year bear trend. That is unlikely. However, yesterday was the 3rd small reversal attempt in the past 7 days. There is therefore a parabolic wedge sell climax. And it is at a very important price. Finally, the stop for the bears is above the January 31 high, which means their risk is great. This combination typically results in profit taking.<p>While there is no reversal up yet, traders should expect some short covering to begin within a couple weeks. This should create sideways to up trading that will last a couple weeks or more.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from above yesterday’s high and then up from below yesterday’s low. There is a credible buy signal at support on the daily chart. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a several bull trend days over the next few weeks.<p>The odds will begin to increase if today and the next several days have bull bodies. Therefore, the bulls will try to get today to close above the open. A stronger sign of a possible reversal up would be a close back above yesterday’s high after already going outside down overnight.<p>However, the series of bull days has not begun yet. The bears want this test of the 2017 gap to fail. They know bulls are starting to buy. The bears want a strong break below today’s low. That would increase the chance that this selloff will continue down to the January 2017 low at bottom of the 2017 bull trend.<p>Even though the bear trend has been strong for 2 weeks, the odds have now shifted in favor of the bulls for a couple weeks. It is more likely that the EURUSD will begin to reverse up than continue down for more than a few days. But a couple big bear days would shift the odds back in favor of the bears.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-sell-climax-and-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then sell climax and bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls want a strong breakout above the 3400 Big Round Number.<p>Yesterday got near that target. Traders expect it to get closer within a few days. Furthermore, they expect at least a small breakout above. If there is a big breakout with follow-through over the following days, the rally will probably continue up to the Leg 1 = Leg 2 target at 3468.<p>More likely, the Emini will begin to pull back to the February 10 low within a week. That is the bottom of the most recent leg up and therefore a magnet below.<p>Also, there is a 50% chance of a selloff down to the January low by the end of March. This 3 week rally looks more like it will end up as a bull leg in a trading range that began around Christmas than a resumption of last year’s bull trend.<p>Most recent days have had predominantly trading range price action. Traders will expect that again today and will look for at least one swing up and one swing down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 10 points in the Globex session. The Emini is overbought on the daily chart and there is also a parabolic wedge buy climax top on that chart. There is therefore an increased chance of several bear trend days within the next couple of weeks.<p>However, there is no reversal down yet and the Emini has been working higher. Can the bulls get a strong rally from here? While it is possible, if there is going to be several trend days, down is slightly more likely. But with the past 6 days having mostly trading range price action, traders will continue to bet on reversals until there is a strong breakout up or down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-20.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

After the sell climax, it rallied in a bull channel and closed around the open of the week. This week currently a doji bar on the weekly chart.<p>Since today is Friday, weekly support and resistance are important. The 2 nearest targets are the open and high of the week. If the Emini is within 10 points of either in the final hour, it might get drawn to the magnet.<p>I have mentioned many times over the past 2 weeks that the 3 week rally was probably a leg in a trading range that began at Christmas. Furthermore, I have been saying that there would probably be a test down to the February 10 low within a couple weeks. That was the bottom of the most recent leg up. Yesterday is a good candidate for the start of the test down.<p>Finally, I have said several times that there is a 50% chance that the Emini would fall to the January low by the end of March. That is still true.<p>But since the rally is probably a leg in a trading range, the selloff will be a bear leg in the range. Legs in trading ranges rarely go straight up or down. There is confusion, which means traders take quick profits. This results in pullbacks every few days. If the bear leg has begun, the Emini might go sideways for several days before it falls much further.<p>Also, despite yesterday’s big selloff, the reversal up was big. That is consistent with the trading range price action over the past 7 days. It increases the chance that today will also have at least one swing up and one swing down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 12 points in the Globex session. Day traders are aware that yesterday’s collapse was a surprise. The bulls hope that it was a bear trap and that the bull trend resumes today or early next week.<p>But is was such a big surprise that it more likely will have at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down withing a few days. Furthermore, the February rally is probably a bull leg in a trading range that began around Christmas. Day traders have to consider the possibility that yesterday was the start of a bear leg in a 2 month trading range. This increases the chance of several bear trend days over the next couple weeks.<p>Today is Friday. The most important price is the open of the week. Despite yesterday’s crash on the 5 minute chart to 30 points below the week’s open, the rally got back above the week’s open. Since yesterday was a Big Down, Big Up day, there is Big Confusion. That usually results in a trading range. It therefore increases the chance of a trading range day today. If so, today might get drawn to the open of the week in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-sell-climax-and-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-21.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then sell climax and bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The final 7 days of this 3 week crash formed 3 small legs down. This is therefore a parabolic wedge sell climax at major support. The bears will begin to worry about a sharp reversal up. Also, their stop is far above and many will soon cover some of their shorts to reduce risk. Traders should expect a 100 – 200 pip short covering rally to begin within a week or so. It will probably last about a couple weeks.<p>In addition to the parabolic wedge bottom, there is now a micro double bottom over the past 3 days. A bull day closing near its high today could be a buy signal bar for a 2 week rally to the EMA and above the October low.<p>Alternatively, the 4 day tight trading range is also a bear flag. But it is late in a bear trend, in a sell climax, and at support. This combination makes it a good candidate for a Final Bear Flag. If there is a bear breakout, it will probably only last a few days. Traders would then expect the short covering rally to begin after that brief bear breakout.<p>Much less likely is that the crash will continue down to the 2017 low without first having a 2 week short covering bounce.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways for 4 days at support in a sell climax. A bull day today would form a micro double bottom with Wednesday’s low.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high. Today would then be a buy signal bar for Monday. That could lead to several bull trend days over the next couple weeks.<p>A 4 day tight trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. In addition to it being a micro double bottom, it is also a micro double top bear flag. The bears therefore might get a bear breakout today or next week.<p>But if they do, it will probably fail. Therefore, there could be a bear trend day within the next few days, but it will probably quickly lead to a sharp reversal up. Day traders should be prepared for a swing up starting within a week. This is true even if there is one more brief trend down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-spike-and-channel-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The selloff is getting near the 1st target, which is the February 10 buy climax low.<p>This week closed near its low on the weekly chart. It is therefore a sell signal bar for next week on the weekly chart. The bears have a Low 2 top in a buy climax at the top of a bull channel. I have been saying that there is a 50% chance of a test of the January low by the end of March.

The final 7 days of this 3 week crash formed 3 small legs down. This is therefore a parabolic wedge sell climax at major support. The bears will begin to worry about a sharp reversal up. Also, their stop is far above and many will soon cover some of their shorts to reduce risk. Traders should expect a 100 – 200 pip short covering rally to begin within a week or so. It will probably last about a couple weeks.<p>In addition to the parabolic wedge bottom, there is now a micro double bottom over the past 3 days. A bull day closing near its high today could be a buy signal bar for a 2 week rally to the EMA and above the October low.<p>Alternatively, the 4 day tight trading range is also a bear flag. But it is late in a bear trend, in a sell climax, and at support. This combination makes it a good candidate for a Final Bear Flag. If there is a bear breakout, it will probably only last a few days. Traders would then expect the short covering rally to begin after that brief bear breakout.<p>Much less likely is that the crash will continue down to the 2017 low without first having a 2 week short covering bounce.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways for 4 days at support in a sell climax. A bull day today would form a micro double bottom with Wednesday’s low.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high. Today would then be a buy signal bar for Monday. That could lead to several bull trend days over the next couple weeks.<p>A 4 day tight trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. In addition to it being a micro double bottom, it is also a micro double top bear flag. The bears therefore might get a bear breakout today or next week.<p>But if they do, it will probably fail. Therefore, there could be a bear trend day within the next few days, but it will probably quickly lead to a sharp reversal up. Day traders should be prepared for a swing up starting within a week. This is true even if there is one more brief trend down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-spike-and-channel-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The selloff is getting near the 1st target, which is the February 10 buy climax low.<p>This week closed near its low on the weekly chart. It is therefore a sell signal bar for next week on the weekly chart. The bears have a Low 2 top in a buy climax at the top of a bull channel. I have been saying that there is a 50% chance of a test of the January low by the end of March.

However, the rally comes after 4 consecutive bear bars on the monthly chart (not shown). When that is the case, there is usually at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>On the weekly chart above, the rally from the January 2 low now has 3 legs up. It is therefore a wedge. A wedge tends to attract profit takers. This is especially true when the wedge rally is testing a prior high. The 2nd leg up in a double top often is a wedge.<p>There is no top yet. Also, this week closed near its high. Finally, the 3rd leg up in the wedge could easily go several points above the top of the 2nd leg before there is a reversal down. Consequently, the bond futures will probably go at least a little higher. But because of the wedge and the top of a 7 month range, probably not much higher before there is at least a minor reversal down.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Parabolic wedge sell climax down to the April 2017 gap</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-reversal-up-from-sell-climax-at-2017-gap-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-22-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart has sold off strongly for 2 weeks. I have mentioned the gap above the April 17, 2017 high many times over the past 6 months. I said that the EURUSD might have to test the gap before the bulls could regain control.<p>Thursday’s low was 1 pip above the April 17 high. The bulls want a successful test. That means a reversal up from the gap.<p>However, the bears want the test to fail. Instead, the want the EURUSD to continue down to the next support, which is the 2017 low. That was the bottom of a yearlong strong rally.<p>If the bulls can get a reversal up from above that low, they will see the 2 year selloff as a bull flag on the monthly chart (not shown). However, if the bears get a break below that low, the bull case will be over. The bulls need higher lows. A break below that low would be a lower low. The bulls would then have to start over in their attempt to get a bull trend reversal.<h3>Can the selloff continue down to par?</h3><p>Not only do the bears want a break below the 2017 low, they want the selloff to continue down to par (1.00). The momentum down over the past few weeks has been exceptionally strong. That increases the chances for the bears. But the support at the gap and the 2017 low are also strong. Until the bears get their breakout, it is still more likely that the bulls will get a reversal up from above the 2017 low.<h3>Parabolic wedge sell climax on daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-has-reversal-up-from-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-22-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD has been in a free-fall on the daily chart for several weeks. The stop for the bears is now far above. Many bears will want to reduce their risk.<p>The easiest way is to buy back some of their shorts. When the sell climax is extreme like it is on the daily chart, the short covering typically has at least a couple legs sideways to up. Also, it usually lasts 10 bars or more. Therefore, traders are looking for about a 100 – 200 pip rally for a couple weeks. It probably began Friday.<p>Wednesday was the 3rd pause in the selling in 7 days. Three legs down in a tight bear channel is a parabolic wedge sell climax. The bulls are hoping that Friday’s bull trend bar was the start of the short covering rally. The EURUSD got to within 1 pip of closing the gap and there is a parabolic wedge selloff down to that support. There was a strong rally on Friday. Many bears are beginning to take profits and bulls are starting to buy.<p>If the bulls can create one or two more big bull bars on the daily chart, traders will conclude that the EURUSD has begun at least a couple weeks of short covering. But if the bears get a couple closes below this week’s low, especially far below, traders will expect the selloff to continue down to the 2017 low.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Breakout above the January high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-is-testing-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-22-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart is testing top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;rallied strongly in February. It is now testing the top of its 10 year bull channel. There is currently a prominent tail on top with one week left to the month. That is a sign that traders see the channel as resistance.<p>January was a sell signal bar. Instead of falling below the January low and triggering the monthly sell signal, the Emini rallied to above the January high. The bulls want a close above the January high. That gap between the close of the month and the January high could lead to some kind of measured move up. More likely, the Emini will stall at the top of the bull channel.<p>Friday closed only 1 tick above the January’s high. There is still a week left to the month. With the selloff on Thursday and Friday, it is more likely that February will close below the January high.<p>As I have said many times over the past few weeks, I think the Emini is in a bull leg in a trading range on the daily chart. The range began around Christmas. The Emini will probably trade down to at least the February 10 low within a few weeks.<h3>Support and resistance at the end of the month</h3><p>What has that daily chart got to do with the monthly chart? Well, this coming week is the final week of the month. Traders will therefore look for the Emini to gravitate to monthly support or resistance at the end of the week. This is especially true for the final hour of the week.<p>Currently, the most important magnet is the January high. If the bulls can get the month to close above that high, the odds of higher prices in March would be better. But if the bears can get February to close below the January high, traders will wonder if the rally is stalling. That would increase the chance of sideways trading in March.<p>Can February close down at the January low? Unlikely. That low is far below and there is only one week left to the month. But if the Emini sells off strongly down to that low, February would have formed a micro double top with January. That would increase the chance of lower prices in March.<h3>2020 will probably be in a range from 2900 to 3500</h3><p>Last year was a huge bull bar on the yearly chart (not shown, but on a yearly chart, each bar is one year). It came late in a bull trend. It is therefore likely exhaustive. Traders should expect a neutral bar in 2020.<p>One example would be a bar with a smaller range and a close around the open. If this year is a doji bar on the yearly chart and it has a smaller range, the 1st 2 months might have covered most of the range for the year. Or, if the Emini reverses down, the rally might be making the tail on the top of a doji bar or bear reversal bar.<p>I have said several times since December that 2020 might form a big trading range between 2900 and 3500. I still think this is true. The Emini is getting close to the top of that range. This tends to limit the upside from here.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Low 2 top at top of bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-Low-2-top-sell-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-22-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart has Low 2 top sell signal bar\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a bear reversal bar this week after 2 big bull bars. Those 2 big bull bars came late in the bull trend that began in October. This is the 2nd 2-bar buy climax in the past 6 weeks. There are now consecutive buy climaxes, which increases the chance of a pullback.<p>This past week is a sell signal bar for the coming week. There is now a Low 2 top at the top of the bull channel. Next week should trade below this week’s low. That will trigger the weekly sell signal.<p>Because the context is good, there will probably be more sellers than buyers below last week’s low. This means that traders should expect lower prices over the next couple of weeks.<h3>Exhaustive buy climax</h3><p>Whenever there is an usually big bull bar or a pair of reasonably strong bull bars coming late in a trend, the rally usually attract profit takers. If enough bulls cover their positions (sell out of their longs), the Emini could reverse down for several bars. If it does, the first magnets below are the EMA and the bottom of that final bull breakout.<p>The rally to the January 22 high is an example. I talked about this at the time and said that there would probably be a 5% pullback. The Emini sold off 4% over the next 2 weeks.<p>A more dramatic example is the rally to the January 26, 2018 high. At that time, I said that the Emini would likely correct 5 – 10% beginning within a few weeks. It sold off 10% over the next 2 weeks.<h3>Consecutive big bull bars but not very climactic</h3><p>There are again consecutive big bull bars and now a sell signal bar. There are some differences from the other 2 examples. The first is the strong sell signal bar this time. Also, it is a 2nd reversal attempt, and 2nd signals have a higher probability of success.<p>However, the bulls have some hope as well. The 4% correction 3 weeks ago relieved some of the overbought condition. Traders sometimes think of the pullback as an opportunity for exhausted bulls to recover their energy during that selloff. That renewed energy makes them more willing to buy again.<p>Because there was a relief from some of the exhaustion after that selloff in late January, the bulls are theoretically less exhausted now. The bulls are less overextended. This reduces the chance of panic profit taking and a sharp reversal down.<p>However, the general idea is the same. Unusually strong bull bars late in a bull trend typically attract profit takers. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a pullback within the next few weeks. The bears now have a reliable setup. Traders should expect at least a couple weeks of sideways to down trading.<p>If there is a selloff, the 1st targets are the EMA and the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the low of 3 weeks ago. The next support is the January low at the bottom of the 2 month trading range.<h3>Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move target at 3460</h3><p>What is the alternative to a selloff? It could be that this week was simply a pause in the rally from the January low. The bulls are hoping that the bull trend from the October low is resuming. They want this rally to reach the Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move target at 3468. A couple closes far above the 3400 Big Round Number would shift the probability in favor of the bulls.<p>The next target would be the top of a broader bull channel on the weekly chart. That is currently around 3520.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>February rally might be bull leg in trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-has-weak-wedge-top-selloff-to-near-support.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-22-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart has weak wedge top selloff to near support\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied strongly in February. But the rally had 3 legs up in a tight bull channel. That made it a parabolic wedge. Since that is a type of buy climax, it often attracts profit takers. The bulls took some profits on Thursday and Friday. Will they take more?<p>Traders are uncertain if the February rally is a resumption of the 5 month bull trend or simply a bull leg in a trading range that began around Christmas. They should get information over the next couple weeks that will help them decide which is more likely. I think a trading range is a higher probability bet, especially after the strong selloffs on Thursday and Friday.<h3>The bulls want a resumption of the 5 month bull trend</h3><p>If the bulls get a couple closes above the 3400 Big Round Number, the odds will shift in favor of the bulls. Traders will be more inclined to think that the October to January bull trend is resuming.<p>They would then expect the rally to continue up to the top of the bull channel on the daily chart. That is currently around 3440. In addition, they would look for the rally to reach the 3468 Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move target on the weekly chart.<h3>The bears want a test of the January low</h3><p>After the 4% correction in January, traders know that the bears can take control. Also, they are uncertain if the exhausted bulls fully recovered during the late January pullback. Are the bulls willing to buy aggressively at the high? Or, have they become more cautious? Are they now only willing to buy pullbacks?<p>The Emini went up and down in January. Therefore, it was sideways. It has broken above the January high, but it has gone sideways for 2 weeks. This week was a doji bar on the weekly chart after 2 climactic bars.<p>These factors tend to limit the upside from here. Also, if the year is going to be in a trading range, there will probably be several smaller ranges within the yearlong range. Christmas is a reasonable candidate for the start of a range. The price action since then is consistent with this. The Emini will probably be sideways to down over the next week and possibly down over the next month.<p>The downside targets are the bottom of the bull channel and especially the January low. There is currently a 50% chance that this selloff will continue down to that low by the end of March.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Furthermore, I said that the parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart made it likely that the Emini would soon reverse down.<p>The Emini had strong selloffs on the 5 minute chart on Thursday and Friday. This was a possible start of a test down to the January low.<p>The Emini sold off strongly overnight and it will probably open around the February 10 low. I have been saying that the January low was also a reasonable target. I have said that the target date was by the end of March. It might get there by the end of February.<p>A couple weeks ago, I said that there was a 30% chance that then Emini could get there by the end of February. I mentioned that the Emini had a bar with a big tail on top on the monthly chart in January and that increased the chance of a 2nd similar bar in February. That increased the chance for a reversal down in the 2nd half of the month.<h3>Weekly Low 2 top sell signal</h3><p>Last week closed near its low on the weekly chart. It is therefore a sell signal bar for this week. There is a Low 2 top at the top of the bull channel on the weekly chart. This week will trigger the sell signal on the open today by gapping below last week’s low.<p>I want to repeat one final point that I have said many times. This year will probably be mostly sideways between 2900 and 3500. That is still the case. Since the Emini was getting near the top of that range, there was an increased chance of a near-term pullback. I said that the Emini was probably putting in an early high for the year. The year will probably have several smaller trading ranges lasting a month or two within a big trading range.<h3>Market realizing that the corona virus is greatly under-reported</h3><p>Finally, as many of you know, I am an MD. I have made the point many times in the chat room that the Corona virus is probably vastly under-reported. It therefore had a greater potential to slow the world’s economy than what the market might be considering. That is why I said in the chat room on Wednesday when the Emini was around 3390 that I went short. I will probably take some profits early today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 90 points in the Globex session. There will be a big gap down. A big gap increases the chance of a trend day. When the gap is down, if there is a trend, down is more likely than up. There is always a concern about a crash when there is a huge gap down, but crashes are rare and therefore the chance is small.<p>The Emini will be far below the 20 bar EMA on the 5 minute chart on the open. Traders do not like selling too far below the average price. That usually reduces the chance of a big selloff on the open.<p>While some traders might see the selloff as a brief opportunity to buy at a big discount, the 3 day selloff is surprisingly big. Many traders expect some follow-through over the coming days. That will reduce the number of traders willing to buy aggressively on the open.<p>With both bulls and bears hesitant, wanting more information, the Emini will probably enter a trading range for the 1st hour or two. The bears will look for a double top or wedge top near the EMA. The bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom.<p>Also, if there is a trading range open and then a trend up or down, the trend usually is not especially strong. There is usually more trading range trading later in the day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-spike-and-channel-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-24.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

There was a parabolic wedge sell climax into the April 2017 gap. Last week’s low got to within 1 pip of closing the gap.<p>The sell climax down to major support compelled bears to take at least partial profits and for bulls traders to buy. However, the February selloff was surprisingly strong. Therefore the 1st reversal up will probably be minor. That means it will lead to either a bear flag or a trading range.<p>Traders do not believe that the bulls have a reasonable chance of getting a bull trend without first creating at least a small trading range and a double bottom. But traders do expect at least a couple weeks of sideways to up trading to begin soon.<p>It might have begun on Friday, but there might be a brief plunge to below the April 7, 2017 high first. That would close that gap on the daily and weekly charts. The minimum goal for a minor reversal up is a pullback to above the October low and up to the EMA.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a tight range overnight in the middle of Friday’s range. The bulls are not yet getting follow-through buying. This increases the chance that the EURUSD will have to close the gap above the April 7, 2017 high before there is a 2 week short covering rally.<p>If today remains an inside bar on the daily chart, it will be a breakout mode bar for tomorrow. That means it would be both a buy and sell signal bar. The bears want today to close near its low. That would make today a stronger sell signal bar. The bulls want today to close near its high and be a stronger buy signal bar.<p>While today could become a big trend day up or down, it will probably remain small. It is disappointing the bulls who wanted strong follow-through after Friday’s big bull day. They will be hesitant to buy aggressively. Friday disappointed the bears and now they, too, are hesitant.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-after-triangle-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom after triangle open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Furthermore, I said that the parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart made it likely that the Emini would soon reverse down.<p>The Emini had strong selloffs on the 5 minute chart on Thursday and Friday. This was a possible start of a test down to the January low.<p>The Emini sold off strongly overnight and it will probably open around the February 10 low. I have been saying that the January low was also a reasonable target. I have said that the target date was by the end of March. It might get there by the end of February.<p>A couple weeks ago, I said that there was a 30% chance that then Emini could get there by the end of February. I mentioned that the Emini had a bar with a big tail on top on the monthly chart in January and that increased the chance of a 2nd similar bar in February. That increased the chance for a reversal down in the 2nd half of the month.<h3>Weekly Low 2 top sell signal</h3><p>Last week closed near its low on the weekly chart. It is therefore a sell signal bar for this week. There is a Low 2 top at the top of the bull channel on the weekly chart. This week will trigger the sell signal on the open today by gapping below last week’s low.<p>I want to repeat one final point that I have said many times. This year will probably be mostly sideways between 2900 and 3500. That is still the case. Since the Emini was getting near the top of that range, there was an increased chance of a near-term pullback. I said that the Emini was probably putting in an early high for the year. The year will probably have several smaller trading ranges lasting a month or two within a big trading range.<h3>Market realizing that the corona virus is greatly under-reported</h3><p>Finally, as many of you know, I am an MD. I have made the point many times in the chat room that the Corona virus is probably vastly under-reported. It therefore had a greater potential to slow the world’s economy than what the market might be considering. That is why I said in the chat room on Wednesday when the Emini was around 3390 that I went short. I will probably take some profits early today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 90 points in the Globex session. There will be a big gap down. A big gap increases the chance of a trend day. When the gap is down, if there is a trend, down is more likely than up. There is always a concern about a crash when there is a huge gap down, but crashes are rare and therefore the chance is small.<p>The Emini will be far below the 20 bar EMA on the 5 minute chart on the open. Traders do not like selling too far below the average price. That usually reduces the chance of a big selloff on the open.<p>While some traders might see the selloff as a brief opportunity to buy at a big discount, the 3 day selloff is surprisingly big. Many traders expect some follow-through over the coming days. That will reduce the number of traders willing to buy aggressively on the open.<p>With both bulls and bears hesitant, wanting more information, the Emini will probably enter a trading range for the 1st hour or two. The bears will look for a double top or wedge top near the EMA. The bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom.<p>Also, if there is a trading range open and then a trend up or down, the trend usually is not especially strong. There is usually more trading range trading later in the day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-spike-and-channel-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-24.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

There was a parabolic wedge sell climax into the April 2017 gap. Last week’s low got to within 1 pip of closing the gap.<p>The sell climax down to major support compelled bears to take at least partial profits and for bulls traders to buy. However, the February selloff was surprisingly strong. Therefore the 1st reversal up will probably be minor. That means it will lead to either a bear flag or a trading range.<p>Traders do not believe that the bulls have a reasonable chance of getting a bull trend without first creating at least a small trading range and a double bottom. But traders do expect at least a couple weeks of sideways to up trading to begin soon.<p>It might have begun on Friday, but there might be a brief plunge to below the April 7, 2017 high first. That would close that gap on the daily and weekly charts. The minimum goal for a minor reversal up is a pullback to above the October low and up to the EMA.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a tight range overnight in the middle of Friday’s range.

Instead, it looked more like a bull leg in a trading range that began at Christmas. That is why I have been saying that traders should expect a test of the bottom of the range. That is the January 31 low.<p>I also said that the Emini might bounce from there and rally back to around 3300. If it reversed down again from there, there would be a head and shoulders top on the daily chart with the January 22 high as the right shoulder. Traders would then wonder if the correction will test the 3000 top of the 2 year trading range. That would be about 10% down from the high.<p>Yesterday got to within a few ticks of my target of the January low and then reversed up strongly. The rally failed and the day closed just below the open. It was a doji bar on the daily chart. The selling has been extreme and the Emini is at support. The Emini might be sideways to up for 2 – 3 days. But after 3 strong days down, the 1st reversal up will probably be minor.<h3>The importance of the monthly chart</h3><p>There are 4 trading days left to the month. The Emini might still trade below the January low in February. It would then be an outside down month. Furthermore, if February closes near its low, it will form a micro double top with January on the monthly chart. That would make lower prices likely in March.<p>Even if February does not go outside down, it will probably close below the midpoint of the month. That increases the chance of lower prices in March.<p>Is this the start of a bear trend? It is too early to tell. But if the bears continue to get bear bars, traders will expect a 10% correction.<p>I have been saying since Christmas that 2020 will be in a trading range between 2900 and 3500. Also, I said that the high of the year would probably be in the 1st quarter. Both are still likely.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. The bulls are hoping that yesterday’s 2 legs down will form a double bottom. Since that double bottom would be 40 points tall, a measured move up from a break above the neck line would test 3300.<p>However, the monthly chart is very important this week. There is now a micro double top on the monthly chart. The bears retraced a month-long rally in just a few days. They are therefore strong and traders expect the month to close near its low.<p>Consequently, traders should not look for a strong rally far above yesterday’s neck line today. More likely, February will close around its low and the January low. Therefore, the Emini will probably be sideways for the rest of the week. That means a trading range.<p>The intraday ranges over the past few days have been huge. Therefore, even if the Emini goes sideways, the legs up and down will be big enough for day traders to swing trade. The bulls will look to buy reversals up from selloffs and then take profits around prior highs. The bears will sell around prior highs and take profits around prior lows. If a leg up or down is particularly strong, traders will wait for a 2nd signal before entering on the reversal.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-after-triangle-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-25.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom after triangle open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There was a small parabolic wedge sell climax at the end of the 3 week selloff. A sell climax at support typically leads to 2 – 3 weeks of profit taking. Traders are deciding if the short covering has begun.<p>The bulls have consecutive bull bars and a micro double bottom. The context and the bull bars are enough to make at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up likely.<p>However, the bull bars are not especially big and they have prominent tails on top. This rally will probably not lead to significant profit taking. It is therefore likely that there will be another brief leg down to a new low within a couple weeks. That means the gap will close.<h3>How much short covering?</h3><p>Whether the rally has begun or there will be one more brief leg down does not matter. Traders expect a 2 – 3 week short covering rally that is relatively strong after such an extreme sell climax.<p>For example, they would like to see a rally that has at least 2 legs up. Furthermore, they think the rally will go back above the October low and possibly to the January low. That means the rally will probably go up 150 – 200 pips.<p>What no one yet knows is if the rally has begun. At the moment, the current rally will probably not meet those objectives. It there therefore more likely to be a small bear flag. If so, it will probably be the Final Bear Flag. That means one more leg down before there would then be the expected short covering rally to above the October low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied a little overnight. It then sold off to a new low and bounced. This is trading range price action.<p>Yesterday is a sell signal bar for today. But it is the 2nd consecutive bull bar on the daily chart after a sell climax. If today trades below yesterday’s low, there will probably be more buyers than sellers there.<p>The bears want a better sell signal bar on the daily chart. They therefore will try to get today to close near its low. That would make today a more reliable sell signal bar. The 3 day rally would be a Low 1 bear flag. But even then, at least a 2nd leg sideways to up is likely after the micro double bottom and consecutive bull bars.<p>The fight today is over the close. The bears will sell rallies and try to get the day to close near its low. Since the bulls do not want a good sell signal bar on the daily chart, they will buy around the low of the day. They will try to get the day to close above its middle or at least 10 – 20 pips above the low.<p>Traders are exhausted. They will probably need at least a few more days to decide whether this rally is the start of a 200 pip short covering rally or just a brief bear flag. This hesitation reduces the chance of a big trend day up or down today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-bear-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend and bear trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There were waves of selling that prevented the bulls from creating reasonable buy setups.<p>The Emini is now at the weekly bull trend line. Because today was such a huge bear day, there might not be many firms left to sell tomorrow at this price. That increases the chance of a rally for a day or two. Also, 3 consecutive huge bear days would be very unusual.<p>When a selloff from a high is huge like this, there is a 70% chance of at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down after the 1st bounce. Consequently, traders will look to sell again after a 2 – 3 day rally.<p>While it may not appear possible, there is a 30% chance that this is a bear trap and the Emini reverses up sharply from here back to the high. But remember, there is a 70% chance of at least a small 2nd leg down. That means the bulls will probably need a micro double bottom before they can get a rally. Furthermore, the selling has been so extreme that the best the bulls will probably get is a trading range for a month or two.<p>At the moment, it is likely that the selloff will go down to test the 2 year trading range high at around 3000 within a month. That would be a 10% correction, which is a popular target for reversals. However, there will probably be a bounce starting this week first.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But after 3 strong days down, the 1st reversal up will probably be minor.<h3>The importance of the monthly chart</h3><p>There are 4 trading days left to the month. The Emini might still trade below the January low in February. It would then be an outside down month. Furthermore, if February closes near its low, it will form a micro double top with January on the monthly chart. That would make lower prices likely in March.<p>Even if February does not go outside down, it will probably close below the midpoint of the month. That increases the chance of lower prices in March.<p>Is this the start of a bear trend? It is too early to tell. But if the bears continue to get bear bars, traders will expect a 10% correction.<p>I have been saying since Christmas that 2020 will be in a trading range between 2900 and 3500. Also, I said that the high of the year would probably be in the 1st quarter. Both are still likely.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. The bulls are hoping that yesterday’s 2 legs down will form a double bottom. Since that double bottom would be 40 points tall, a measured move up from a break above the neck line would test 3300.<p>However, the monthly chart is very important this week. There is now a micro double top on the monthly chart. The bears retraced a month-long rally in just a few days. They are therefore strong and traders expect the month to close near its low.<p>Consequently, traders should not look for a strong rally far above yesterday’s neck line today. More likely, February will close around its low and the January low. Therefore, the Emini will probably be sideways for the rest of the week. That means a trading range.<p>The intraday ranges over the past few days have been huge. Therefore, even if the Emini goes sideways, the legs up and down will be big enough for day traders to swing trade. The bulls will look to buy reversals up from selloffs and then take profits around prior highs. The bears will sell around prior highs and take profits around prior lows. If a leg up or down is particularly strong, traders will wait for a 2nd signal before entering on the reversal.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-after-triangle-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-25.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom after triangle open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There was a small parabolic wedge sell climax at the end of the 3 week selloff. A sell climax at support typically leads to 2 – 3 weeks of profit taking. Traders are deciding if the short covering has begun.<p>The bulls have consecutive bull bars and a micro double bottom. The context and the bull bars are enough to make at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up likely.<p>However, the bull bars are not especially big and they have prominent tails on top. This rally will probably not lead to significant profit taking. It is therefore likely that there will be another brief leg down to a new low within a couple weeks. That means the gap will close.<h3>How much short covering?</h3><p>Whether the rally has begun or there will be one more brief leg down does not matter. Traders expect a 2 – 3 week short covering rally that is relatively strong after such an extreme sell climax.<p>For example, they would like to see a rally that has at least 2 legs up. Furthermore, they think the rally will go back above the October low and possibly to the January low. That means the rally will probably go up 150 – 200 pips.<p>What no one yet knows is if the rally has begun. At the moment, the current rally will probably not meet those objectives. It there therefore more likely to be a small bear flag. If so, it will probably be the Final Bear Flag. That means one more leg down before there would then be the expected short covering rally to above the October low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied a little overnight. It then sold off to a new low and bounced. This is trading range price action.<p>Yesterday is a sell signal bar for today. But it is the 2nd consecutive bull bar on the daily chart after a sell climax. If today trades below yesterday’s low, there will probably be more buyers than sellers there.<p>The bears want a better sell signal bar on the daily chart. They therefore will try to get today to close near its low. That would make today a more reliable sell signal bar. The 3 day rally would be a Low 1 bear flag. But even then, at least a 2nd leg sideways to up is likely after the micro double bottom and consecutive bull bars.<p>The fight today is over the close. The bears will sell rallies and try to get the day to close near its low. Since the bulls do not want a good sell signal bar on the daily chart, they will buy around the low of the day. They will try to get the day to close above its middle or at least 10 – 20 pips above the low.<p>Traders are exhausted. They will probably need at least a few more days to decide whether this rally is the start of a 200 pip short covering rally or just a brief bear flag. This hesitation reduces the chance of a big trend day up or down today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-bear-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend and bear trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There were waves of selling that prevented the bulls from creating reasonable buy setups.<p>The Emini is now at the weekly bull trend line. Because today was such a huge bear day, there might not be many firms left to sell tomorrow at this price. That increases the chance of a rally for a day or two. Also, 3 consecutive huge bear days would be very unusual.<p>When a selloff from a high is huge like this, there is a 70% chance of at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down after the 1st bounce. Consequently, traders will look to sell again after a 2 – 3 day rally.<p>While it may not appear possible, there is a 30% chance that this is a bear trap and the Emini reverses up sharply from here back to the high. But remember, there is a 70% chance of at least a small 2nd leg down. That means the bulls will probably need a micro double bottom before they can get a rally. Furthermore, the selling has been so extreme that the best the bulls will probably get is a trading range for a month or two.<p>At the moment, it is likely that the selloff will go down to test the 2 year trading range high at around 3000 within a month. That would be a 10% correction, which is a popular target for reversals. However, there will probably be a bounce starting this week first.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Consecutive big selloffs like those of Monday and Tuesday typically attract profit takers and bargain hunters. This increases the chance of a bull trend today or tomorrow. Can today crash again? While possible, a 3rd huge bear day would be very unusual.<p>I have been saying that February might get down to the January low and create a micro double top on the monthly chart. Yesterday fell far below the January low. Perhaps too far. There are 3 trading days left to the month. Traders have to wonder if there will be buying into the end of the month. Will February get back to near the open of the month and create a doji bar on the monthly chart instead of a big bear bar? The bulls have a 30% chance of this.<p>A short covering rally in a strong bear breakout typically lasts a day and a half to 3 days. That might begin today.<p>The selloff was surprisingly strong. Traders should expect a 2nd leg down after a bounce. The selloff might reach 3000 at the top of the 2 year trading range before the bulls will try again to make another new high. That would also be a 10% correction.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 15 points in the Globex session. It sold off again last night. After falling below the 3100 Big Round Number, it reversed up. On the 60 minute and 4 hour Globex charts, there is now a parabolic wedge sell climax.<p>Since a 3rd huge bear day would be very unusual, today and the rest of the week (and therefore month) will probably be either sideways or up. The bulls might need to stop the selling for a day before they can create a rally. Traders expect a strong short covering rally for 1 and a half to 3 days to begin this week. It might test the January low, which would retrace about half of the selloff.<p>Because the daily range was big yesterday, the bars and legs up and down will probably be big again today. That means stops will be far and traders have to trade small size. Micro Emini is an alternative. Furthermore, scalpers will initially look for 5 – 10 point scalps and not 1 – 2 point scalps.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-bear-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-26.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend and bear trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The rally had 3 small bull bars and it is stalling at the EMA and the October low resistance.<p>But 5 days without a pullback is a 5 day micro channel. The bears typically need at least a micro double top before they can resume the bear trend. Therefore, the EURUSD will probably go sideways for at least a couple more days before the bears will be able to close that gap.<p>Traders expect a 2 – 3 week short covering rally after a climactic reversal down to major support. This rally so far is disappointing.<p>With the bear flag and the rally both being weak, there is confusion. That is a hallmark of a trading range. Consequently, the EURUSD will probably be mostly sideways for at least a couple more days.<p>At that point, traders will have more information. They are deciding if the 150 – 200 pip short covering rally has begun.<p>The alternative is that this rally will be a bear flag. If so, a bear flag late in a bear trend is usually the Final Bear Flag before there is a bigger reversal up. In either case, traders expect at least a few weeks of sideways up trading now or soon.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above the October low yesterday and above the 20 day EMA today. I have been saying that both were likely targets.<p>However, the EURUSD reversed down from this resistance over the past couple hours. The bears will try to get today to close on its low and below the October low. If they are successful, today would be a reasonable sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>But as I wrote above, the context is bad. The EURUSD will probably be sideways for the rest of the week. This is true whether the bears create a sell signal bar today or if the bulls get a 4th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart.<p>Because 3 consecutive bull bars in a weak rally is excessive, the bears will probably be able to create a bear bar today. That means day traders should find it easier to make money selling rallies than buying selloffs.<p>But since the EURUSD is exhausted, the 4 day rally will probably evolve into a trading range for a few days. Therefore day traders expect reversals and small moves up and down, even if today closes below the October low and around the low of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-Low-2-top-and-then-bear-channel-and-test-3100-big-round-number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 top and then bear channel and test 3100 big round number\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was a bear trending trading range day. There will probably be some short covering tomorrow or Friday. Traders expect a bounce for at least a couple days.<p>The Emini spent the final 2 hours today just above the 3100 Big Round Number. That tells traders that it is important. Many traders will not buy until either there is a reversal up from below 3100 or a strong rally from just above. It might come on Thursday or Friday.<p>Today closed on its low and just above 3100. It therefore will probably trade below 3100 tomorrow. It might even gap below. If so, traders will look for an early low of the day or for a Bear Trend From The Open.<p>February is an outside down month. After breaking above January’s high, it reversed down to below January’s low. But it might get back to the January low by Friday’s close. That is also near the open of the month. February would then be a doji candlestick on the monthly chart. Less likely, the Emini will sell off through the end of the week and the Emini will close on the low of the month.<p>No matter what it does this week, the 1st rally will probably be minor. That means that the Emini will probably be below this week’s low within the next few weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Less likely, the Emini will sell off through the end of the week and the Emini will close on the low of the month.<p>No matter what it does this week, the 1st rally will probably be minor. That means that the Emini will probably be below this week’s low within the next few weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There was a wedge bottom on the 5 minute chart. But, instead of reversing up, the Emini went sideways. That is a sign that the bears might not yet be ready to take some profits. It made lower prices likely today.<p>The selloff continued overnight and today will probably open with a big gap down. The Emini was near a 10% correction overnight. That is a magnet just below the Globex low.<p>February is an extremely big outside down month. There are only 2 trading days remaining. Traders will fight over how the candlestick will look on the monthly chart when it closes tomorrow. The bears would like the month to close on its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices in March.<p>The bulls, however, are hoping to see some short covering before tomorrow’s close. If they do, they, too, will buy, looking for at least a 1 – 3 day bounce.<p>Because the selloff has been extreme, the bounce could be extreme as well. The bulls would like to see strong short covering begin today or tomorrow because February would then close above its low on the monthly chart. That would reduce the bearishness going into March.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini sold off early in the Globex session and then entered a trading range. Since it is down 43 points, today will gap down when the day session opens.<p>A big gap down means that the Emini will be far below the 20 bar EMA. Day traders do not like to sell far below the average price. Consequently, when there is a big gap down, there is only a 20% chance of a strong bear trend from the open.<p>Instead, traders expect a trading range open for the first hour or two. By going sideways, the Emini will get closer to the average price. At that point, traders will look for either a double bottom or wedge bottom to buy for a swing up, or a wedge rally or double top near the EMA for a swing down.<p>Normally, a trading range open reduces the chance of a huge trend day up or down. However, what has been going on this week is not normal. Day traders will be prepared for a surprisingly big trend day up or down. With the daily chart as oversold as it is, if there is a big trend, up is more likely. But it is important to be ready for anything.<p>Finally, with the bars and swings as big as they are, day traders need to trade small position sizes. For example, if many of the bars on the 5 minute chart are 15 – 20 points tall, a day trader with less than a $50,000 account should either trade micro Eminis, trade some other market like the SPY or QQQ, or wait for the bars to get smaller.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-Low-2-top-and-then-bear-channel-and-test-3100-big-round-number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-27.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 top and then bear channel and test 3100 big round number\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Last week’s low was 1 tick above the bottom of the gap.<p>Today’s bar is surprisingly big. It makes it likely that a 2 – 3 week short covering rally is underway. The bulls are now testing the bottom of the 4 month trading range.<p>Because the momentum up is strong, this rally might reach the January 31 sell climax high before there is more than a 2 – 3 day pullback. Traders expect sideways to up for at least another week or two.<p>When a rally is as strong as this, there is usually at least a small 2nd leg up after the 1st reversal down. That reversal usually lasts only a day or two. Therefore, the 1st reversal down will probably be minor.<p>The bears will need at least a micro double top before they can get more than a week of selling. Now that the EURUSD is breaking strongly above the October low, that low will be support again.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied strongly in a bull channel overnight. Day traders have been buying for scalps and for a swing up.<p>At some point, the rally will stall and evolve into a trading range. Once there has been a 20 – 30 pip pullback, bear day traders will look for shorts. However, they will only scalp.<p>Traders expect the daily chart to work sideways to up for at least another week. Therefore, day traders will expect more buying than selling opportunities. Also, they will aggressively buy the 1st 50 – 100 pip pullback.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-midday-wedge-top-and-10-correction-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini midday wedge top and 10% correction\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It sold off to just below the top of the 2 year trading range and just above 3000. The opening low was also at a measured move down from the 2 month double top. After a strong rally to near yesterday’s low, it reversed back to close at the low of the day far below 3000.<p>This selloff is a possible start of a much bigger correction. I have been saying that I think the odds favor a recession in the fall. The stock market often enters a bear market before a recession. This is a good candidate for a 20 – 30% selloff.<p>Tomorrow is the final trading day of the month. The bears want February to close on its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices in March. The bulls will try to create a rally tomorrow to weaken the bearishness of the monthly candlestick.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It rallied early but then sold off to close on its low and well below 3000.<p>Yes, the selling is climactic and at support, but it is unusually strong. There will probably be a violent short covering rally within the next few days. However, the Emini will probably be sideways to down for at least another month. It may have seen the high for the year. Remember, I have been saying that the Emini would probably be sideways all year between 2900 and 3500. It is now at the bottom of that range.<p>I also said several times that a recession is likely in the fall. The stock market usually sells off 6 months before a recession. This is a good candidate for the start of a 20% correction that could lead to a recession later this year.<p>Can today collapse? The daily chart is in a bear trend. If there is going to be a big surprise, down is more likely than up. However, because there is an extreme sell climax at a cluster of support, the chance of another huge bear day is less than otherwise in a bear trend. More likely, the Emini will have one or two big bull days within the next few days.<p>But it may be just neutral today. It often has to stop going down for a day or so before it can go up.<h3>Monthly chart is important today</h3><p>Today is the final day of the week and month. February is a huge outside down month. If it closes near the low, there will be an increased chance of lower prices in March.<p>But, if today rallies strongly, there will be a big tail on the bottom of the February candlestick. It would be less bearish going into March. There would be an increased chance of more short covering next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 45 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap down today.<p>When there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the EMA on the 5 minute chart. Traders are hesitant to sell far below the average price, especially in an oversold market. That reduces the chance of a big bear trend day from the open.<p>However, there might be bargain hunters and then bears might cover some of their shorts. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day. But with the uncertainty over the weekend, it is more likely that a sharp short covering rally will come next week and not today.<p>A big gap down usually leads to a trading range for the 1st hour or two. The Emini gets closer to the EMA by going sideways to up. Once near the EMA, the bears will look for a double top or wedge top to sell. The bulls want a double bottom or wedge bottom. Both are looking for a swing trade to begin in the opening trading range.<p>If there is a trading range open, it reduces the chance of a big trend day. That early trading range trading is a sign that the market is getting neutral. That increases the chance of more trading range trading later in the day and reduces the chance of a relentless trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-midday-wedge-top-and-10-correction-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-28.png\" alt=\"Emini midday wedge top and 10% correction.png\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is a buy climax and at the resistance of the bottom of the 2 month trading range.<p>The 6 day rally and yesterday were surprisingly strong. That typically means that traders will buy the 1st selloff. The bears usually will need at least a micro double top before they can get a new low.<p>There is obvious support below at the October low. It is almost exactly at yesterday’s low. Since yesterday was a buy climax, its low is a magnet. Also, that is around a 50% pullback. Traders should expect a test down to begin within a few days. There will then probably be a higher low and at least one more leg sideways to up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied and then reversed down overnight. Today so far is a bear trend reversal day on the daily chart. It is at resistance and it comes after a buy climax. Traders should expect sideways to down trading for a few days.<p>The 80 pip overnight selloff has been in a tight bear channel. Day traders have only been selling.<p>However the momentum slowed over the past 2 hours. Also, the bears have already achieved their goal of creating a reversal day. Consequently they have less need to sell.<p>The day will probably start to go sideways around the open and yesterday’s close. The bears want the day to close near its low so that there will be a strong sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The bulls want the day to close above the open. Today would still be a sell signal bar on the daily chart, but it would be weaker. That would increase the chance of sideways trading early next week instead of having a test down beginning on Monday.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-triangle-trading-range-open-with-late-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle trading range open with late rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It rallied early but then sold off to close on its low and well below 3000.<p>Yes, the selling is climactic and at support, but it is unusually strong. There will probably be a violent short covering rally within the next few days. However, the Emini will probably be sideways to down for at least another month. It may have seen the high for the year. Remember, I have been saying that the Emini would probably be sideways all year between 2900 and 3500. It is now at the bottom of that range.<p>I also said several times that a recession is likely in the fall. The stock market usually sells off 6 months before a recession. This is a good candidate for the start of a 20% correction that could lead to a recession later this year.<p>Can today collapse? The daily chart is in a bear trend. If there is going to be a big surprise, down is more likely than up. However, because there is an extreme sell climax at a cluster of support, the chance of another huge bear day is less than otherwise in a bear trend. More likely, the Emini will have one or two big bull days within the next few days.<p>But it may be just neutral today. It often has to stop going down for a day or so before it can go up.<h3>Monthly chart is important today</h3><p>Today is the final day of the week and month. February is a huge outside down month. If it closes near the low, there will be an increased chance of lower prices in March.<p>But, if today rallies strongly, there will be a big tail on the bottom of the February candlestick. It would be less bearish going into March. There would be an increased chance of more short covering next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 45 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap down today.<p>When there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the EMA on the 5 minute chart. Traders are hesitant to sell far below the average price, especially in an oversold market. That reduces the chance of a big bear trend day from the open.<p>However, there might be bargain hunters and then bears might cover some of their shorts. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day. But with the uncertainty over the weekend, it is more likely that a sharp short covering rally will come next week and not today.<p>A big gap down usually leads to a trading range for the 1st hour or two. The Emini gets closer to the EMA by going sideways to up. Once near the EMA, the bears will look for a double top or wedge top to sell. The bulls want a double bottom or wedge bottom. Both are looking for a swing trade to begin in the opening trading range.<p>If there is a trading range open, it reduces the chance of a big trend day. That early trading range trading is a sign that the market is getting neutral. That increases the chance of more trading range trading later in the day and reduces the chance of a relentless trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-midday-wedge-top-and-10-correction-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-28.png\" alt=\"Emini midday wedge top and 10% correction.png\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is a buy climax and at the resistance of the bottom of the 2 month trading range.<p>The 6 day rally and yesterday were surprisingly strong. That typically means that traders will buy the 1st selloff. The bears usually will need at least a micro double top before they can get a new low.<p>There is obvious support below at the October low. It is almost exactly at yesterday’s low. Since yesterday was a buy climax, its low is a magnet. Also, that is around a 50% pullback. Traders should expect a test down to begin within a few days. There will then probably be a higher low and at least one more leg sideways to up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied and then reversed down overnight. Today so far is a bear trend reversal day on the daily chart. It is at resistance and it comes after a buy climax. Traders should expect sideways to down trading for a few days.<p>The 80 pip overnight selloff has been in a tight bear channel. Day traders have only been selling.<p>However the momentum slowed over the past 2 hours. Also, the bears have already achieved their goal of creating a reversal day. Consequently they have less need to sell.<p>The day will probably start to go sideways around the open and yesterday’s close. The bears want the day to close near its low so that there will be a strong sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The bulls want the day to close above the open. Today would still be a sell signal bar on the daily chart, but it would be weaker. That would increase the chance of sideways trading early next week instead of having a test down beginning on Monday.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-triangle-trading-range-open-with-late-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle trading range open with late rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

A vaccine is the realistic solution, but that is many months away. This could be the worst pandemic since the 1918 flu, which killed 50 million people.<p>The<strong>Emini</strong>sold off strongly this week. Traders should expect a strong short covering rally next week and then a 2nd leg down. Because the Emini is so oversold, the rally could last several weeks and retrace more than half of the selloff. But, it will probably then trade sideways to down for many months. There is a 50% chance of at least a 20% correction and a 30% chance of at least a 30% correction.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>broke to a new all-time high this week. Since the rally on the weekly chart is in a parabolic wedge, there will probably be a pullback within a couple weeks.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market reversed up sharply from 1 tick above the bottom of the April 2017 gap. Traders should expect at least a small 2nd leg up after the first 3 – 5 day pullback.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Parabolic wedge rally to new all-time high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-breaking-out-to-new-high-in-parabolic-wedge-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-29.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart breaking out to new high in parabolic wedge rally\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures rallied strongly in January and February, despite 4 consecutive bear bars on the monthly chart (not shown). It is trading at a new all-time high.<p>On the weekly chart, there are now 3 legs up from the January low. If there is a reversal within the next couple weeks, the rally will be a parabolic wedge buy climax. Traders would then expect at least a couple small legs sideways to down.<p>The monthly chart had an 8 year nested parabolic wedge rally up to the 2016 high. There were two legs down over the next 2 years. However, the bull trend resumed over the past year.<p>In general, when there is a strong break about a wedge top, there is a 50% chance of a strong leg up. There is also a 50% chance that the breakout will fail and the market will reverse down.<p>American citizens will not tolerate negative interest rate. Also, the nested wedge is a reliable topping pattern. These 2 factors make it more likely that the breakout will fail.<p>However, there is no top at the moment and markets have inertia. They tend to continue what they have been doing. Consequently, the odds favor sideways to up trading until the bears create a good sell signal bar. It can come at any time, but until it does, traders will continue to bet on higher bond prices.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Surprisingly strong reversal up from test of 2017 gap</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-reversing-up-from-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-29-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart reversing up from gap\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart reversed up 2 weeks ago from 1 pip above the April 21, 2017 high. That was the bottom of a gap on both the daily and weekly charts.<p>This week was a big bull bar on the weekly chart. It was big enough to generate confusion. Has the bear trend ended? Has a bull trend begun? Traders need more information, and therefore confusion typically leads to a trading range. Traders are not confident that any move up or down will go far. They therefore take quick profits, which results in at least a few sideways bars.<h3>Did the 2 year bear trend end with the test of the 2017 gap?</h3><p>The bulls are hoping that the February collapse was just a sell vacuum test of the major support at the 2017 gap. If the 2 week rally continues next week, traders will conclude that the 2 big weeks down in early February was just a bear trap and an exhaustive end of the bear trend.<p>One problem with this scenario is that last week was only a small bull doji bar on the weekly chart. That typically is not a strong enough foundation to support a new bull trend. This is especially true when it follows 2 big bear bars. Traders therefore believe that the 2 week rally is a minor reversal up.<h3>Will the selloff continue down to par (1.00)?</h3><p>The bears want the rally to be just another bull leg in a 2 year bear channel. There have been many big rallies and each failed. The bears want a new low, which would close the 2017 gap. They also want the bear channel to fall below the 2017 low and then below par (1.00).<p>However, the 2 week rally was strong enough to lead to at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. Consequently, the bears will need a micro double top. That minimizes the downside risk for at least a couple weeks.<h3>Major trend reversals are uncommon</h3><p>Trend resist change. Therefore most attempts at reversing a trend fail. I have said this during every rally over the past 2 years.<p>A major trend reversal means the 2 year bear trend becomes a bull trend. There are 2 things that would improve the chance of a major trend reversal. First, the two week rally could add several more big bull bars closing on their highs over the next few weeks. That would be a Bull Major Surprise.<p>Second, the rally could last for a few more weeks and then selloff again down to the low of 2 weeks ago. A strong reversal up from around that low would be from a double bottom.<p>In either scenario, if the momentum up is strong, there would be a 40% chance of a new bull trend. Anything less than a strong reversal up would lead to either a bear flag and resumption of the bear trend or a trading range.<p>It is important to understand that the current reversal is still minor. That means it will probably be either a bull leg in the 2 year bear channel or a bull leg in what will become a trading range.<h2>Stock market overview</h2><p>If you have been reading my reports over the past few years, I predicted several 5 – 10% selloffs, but I always made the point that the Emini was soon going higher. Each of those selloffs was likely to be pullback in a bull trend. I am not saying that now because of the size of this week’s selloff and the context (the bars to the left).<p>This past week was unusual. So what is going on? I discuss the technical factors below. There are some non-technical things also contributing to the selloff. The obvious two are the coronavirus and Bernie Sanders. Both require a repricing of assets. Everything now is less valuable. Obviously, if Sanders is elected and if he was able to get all that he says he wants, the stock market would fall.<p>I want to talk more about the coronavirus. As you know, I am an MD. I began my career as a medical scientist and have a lot of experience in the medical community and with major university medical centers. This experience influences my thoughts.<p>A pandemic is a vague term, but I think that we are either in one or that there will soon be a consensus that one has begun. The term does not matter. What matters is that the coronavirus outbreak is changing everyone’s behavior in ways that reduce consumption and production. The result is that companies earn less and are less valuable. The average price of all assets, including stocks, falls.<div id=\"coronavirus-pandemic\"><h3>Possibly millions will die this year</h3></div><p>The coronavirus pandemic could be vastly worse than what the experts are saying. We are fighting it as hard as we can with all that we have, but what we have is not enough to win. At the moment, all we have is quarantining sick people, hand washing, and avoiding sick people.<p>This containment approach is the only current solution, but it has very little chance of working. And it has been failing. A vaccine is the only answer, and we need billions of doses. That means the solution won’t come until the end of the year.<p>Do the math. The flu kills 500,000 people worldwide every year. This is true even with an available vaccine. Incidentally, vaccines are only about 70% effective.<p>Coronavirus is equally contagious and 10 times more deadly. That means it is not unrealistic to expect to expect several million people to die this year.<p>Also, we now know that each patient infects an average of 4 people. Assume that it takes 7 days for an infected person to get sick and to infect 4 more people. If that went on for a year, the number of potential infections is millions of times more people than there are in the world.<span style=\"background-color:#ff0\">You have to wonder if half the world will be infected before there is a vaccine.</span><p>If 3 billion people get sick and 2% die, that is tens of millions dead.<span style=\"background-color:#ff0\">This could be the worst pandemic since the 1918 flu, which killed 50 million people. I know that sounds crazy, but that is what the math looks like to me.</span><p>Every year we get flu shots. We may now start to get annual flu and coronavirus shots.<h3>A vaccine is the only solution</h3><p>The coronavirus problem will be solved by the end of the year when a vaccine becomes available. If the pandemic is temporary, how much damage can it do?<span style=\"background-color:#ff0\">If I am right and it is a much bigger problem than what the experts are saying, it could easily lead to a 30 – 50% correction this year.</span><p>It takes time for information to come in, and it might be more than a month before experts begin to suggest that it could kill millions of people. There could be several strong attempts to resume the bull trend in the meantime. But if this is anywhere as big a problem as it could be, it could result in a serious bear trend.<h3>Don’t forget the inverted yield curve in August</h3><p>The 10 year note yield fell to less than the 2 year yield in August, 2019. That is an abnormal situation and it is called an inverted yield curve. All 7 recessions since 1970 were preceded by an inverted yield curve. Each recession came between 5 and 17 months after the inversion. We are now in that window. The yield curve is telling us that a recession is likely, probably this year.<p>Recessions are typically preceded by a stock market selloff coming about 6 months earlier. If we know there will probably be a recession and that it will be preceded by a stock market selloff, this week is a credible candidate for that selloff. Consequently, there is an increased chance that this selloff will lead to a recession later in the year.<p>Sometimes a stock market selloff can be a major contributing factor to a recession due to the wealth effect. That is the increase or decrease in spending due to a change in our perceived wealth.<p>If the stock market sells off, people who own stock will have less money. They will buy fewer things. Companies that make those things will sell less and make less money. The earnings drop exacerbates the selloff.<p>As they make less money, they cut back. One of the most common ways is to lay employees off. That means fewer consumers buying things.<h3>Recession means 2 quarters of negative GDP</h3><p>The result of all of this is that the economy can shrink instead of continuing to grow. GDP is the most common measure of economic growth. If it is negative for 2 consecutive quarters, then there is officially a recession.<p>Two quarters means 6 months after the start of the shrinkage of the economy. If the recession comes later this year, as I think is likely, the economy begins to shrink at least 6 months earlier. This might be the start.<h3>Is this a crash?</h3><p>No, but crashes occur almost every day. A crash is just a lot of bars in a strong bear trend. You can find them on the 1 minute chart several times every week. On even smaller time frames, they happen every day.<p>While those are crashes, that is not what people mean when they talk about a crash. In 1929, the stock market lost almost 90% of its value over 3 years in a bear channel. In 1987, it fell almost 25% in a day. Those are the only 2 times in the past 100 years when there is a widespread agreement that the market crashed.<p>The Emini crashed this week on the 5 minute chart and on the 60 minute chart. It has only fallen 16% and one week on the daily chart. Therefore, it has to fall much further before traders will refer to the selloff as a crash. Crashes are rare and therefore this will almost certainly not grow into a crash.<h3>Why was it so fast?</h3><p>The selloff was very fast. That is because 80% of equity trading and 90% of futures trading is done by computer algorithms. They instantly make decisions and execute trades without hesitation. They chase momentum and will continue trading in one direction until there are not enough computers left to take the other side.<p>Moves are also exaggerated by options trading. For example, in a big down day, half of the selloff can be caused by option gamma. That is the rate of increase in put values as the market falls.<p>Option selling firms are huge. They basically insure all institutions, which buy puts to protect their portfolios. If the market falls, the value of puts increase at an increasing faster rate. That is the gamma effect. Option selling firms have to hedge their short puts. They do so by selling stocks and futures, exacerbating the selloff.<h3>This is probably not just another pullback</h3><p>For the past 10 years, traders have bought every 10 – 20% pullback and made money. Well, here’s their chance. If you have traded for 10 years or less, you have never seen this before. I have been trading for 34 years and I believe this is not going to snap right back like the Emini did at Christmas 2018.<p>But I do believe next week will rally strongly enough to make traders wonder. That kind of reversal is rare and therefore unlikely. Also, this selloff was much stronger. There is a 70% chance that there will be a lower high and a 2nd leg sideways to down. Also, there is a 30% chance of a 30 – 50% correction this year.<h3>What if this is the start of a bear market?</h3><p>The definition of a bear market is a 20% drop from the high. So far, the Emini has fallen 16%. Here are some guidelines as to what to expect if the market falls 20%. Once the market falls 20%, it usually falls more. There have been more than 30 corrections of 20% or more since 1927 and the average was 30%. The final low comes after about a year after the selloff begins. It is important to note that it takes almost 2 years before there is another new all-time high.<p>I have been saying for a couple years that the market will be in a trading range for about a decade. Therefore, even once there is a new high, it will probably not last. Traders should expect reversals for many years.<p>There will be at least a couple 30 – 50% selloffs in the next 10 years. That is frustrating for investors but good for traders. For example, if a trader buys a 50% pullback and holds it until there is a new high, he will double his money. If he buys a 30% selloff and holds until there is a new high, he will make almost 50%.<p>This is difficult to do, but it will probably be the best approach for many years. Investors will probably be disappointed by the lack of gains like they were in the decade long trading ranges of the 1970’s and the 2000’s.<h3>Remember January 2018</h3><p>In late 2017 and in the 1st few weeks of 2018, I repeatedly made the point that the stock market had never been that overbought on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts in the history of the Dow or S&amp;P. I said that there was going to be a 5 – 10% correction within weeks. The Emini fell 10% over the next month.<p>Why did I say only 10%? Because as climactic as the market was, it was also in a strong bull trend. Traders did not have a chance to buy even a 2% pullback in a long time. The odds were high that they would buy a 5 – 10% pullback.<p>However, when there is an unusually extreme buy climax, the market gets exhausted. There is typically another leg up after the 1st pullback and that leg often becomes the final rally before a bigger selloff.<p>One could argue that the 2018 – 2019 trading range was the pause after the 1st buy climax and the 2019 rally was the 2nd and final leg up in the 10 year bull trend.<p>It is too early to know, but last week’s selloff is consistent with this. There was the most extreme buy climax in history followed by a 2 year pause, then another extreme buy climax in 2019, and finally an unusually strong selloff this week.<h3>How low can the market go?</h3><p>I believe that there is a 30% chance of at least a 30% selloff this year. It could be more. Look at the 50% selloff in 2002 and the 60% selloff in 2009. It is foolish to think that selloffs of that size will never come again. They will.<p>Whether or not this is the start of a 30 – 50% pullback, I have been saying for a couple years that this unusually climactic rally will probably have around a 50% selloff starting within 5 years. This has nothing to do with the coronavirus. It was purely technical. You never know what black swan would cause it. Coronavirus is a good candidate.<p>I have said that the bottom of the 2014 – 2015 trading range was a reasonable target. The Emini tried to reverse there and again in late 2017. The bottom of prior reversal attempts are magnets for later reversal attempts. That 2017 trading range low is around 1800, which would be about a 47% selloff from the current all-time high.<h3>Many stocks forming bearish patterns</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MSFT-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-29-2.png\" alt=\"MSFT monthly candlestick chart in parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/UAL-monthly-candlestick-chart-breaking-strorngly-below-bull-trendline-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-29-3.png\" alt=\"UAL monthly candlestick chart breaking strongly below bull trendline\"></a></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SO-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-oo-final-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-29-4.png\" alt=\"SO monthly candlestick chart in parabolic wedge buy climax and oo final bull flag\"></a></figure><p>Many major stocks are forming bearish patterns on the monthly charts. MSFT has a huge bear reversal bar at the top of a parabolic wedge buy climax. That makes higher prices unlikely for many bars (months). There is a 50% chance of a deep correction that could last a year or more. AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MA, COST, NKE, KO, PHM, LMT, CP, LLY, and DUK have similar patterns.<p>Other stocks are breaking below major topping patterns. For example, XOM has a big breakout below a 15 year head and shoulders top. That makes it likely that it will be sideways to down for many months. F, UAL, CCL, and many others are having similar breakdowns.<p>This means the selloff is broad and affecting many sectors. That increases the chance of significantly lower prices over the next year. At a minimum, it will make it difficult for the market to make a significant new high this year.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Emini 16% correction down from top of bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-monthly-SP500-candlestick-chart-has-huge-outside-down-month.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-29-5.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly S&amp;P500 candlestick chart has huge outside down month\"></a></figure><p>Two weeks ago when the Emini was above the January high, I wrote that there was a 30% chance of a strong reversal down to below the January low by the end of the month. That is because January was a credible sell signal bar at the top of a 13 year bull channel and it was a bear doji. When there is a bear doji at resistance, the next bar often as a big tail on top as well. Therefore, traders needed to be open to the possibility of a sharp selloff at the end of February.<p>Obviously, the size of the selloff was a low probability event. When there is a low probability bear event, bulls are trapped into bad longs and many bears are trapped out of a good short. That means there is typically at least a small 2nd leg down.<h3>Probably at least 2 legs down on the monthly chart</h3><p>There will likely be at least a small 2nd leg sideways down on the daily chart after the 1st bounce, and maybe on the weekly chart. On the monthly chart, February is still only the 1st bar down from the high. The bears will need at least a few down months before traders will expect a 2nd leg down on the monthly chart. That has not happened since the 2015 selloff, but it appears probable again this time. This is especially true, given the incipient pandemic.<p>There were many bear bars over the past 2 years. That is selling pressure and it increases the chance of lower prices. Also, the Emini is late in a bull trend and at the top of the 13 year bull channel. Finally, February was a surprisingly big bear bar at resistance in a buy climax. These factors increase the chance that the Emini might be sideways to down for many months.<h3>Reversing down from the top of the bull channel</h3><p>I wrote in December that the monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;was breaking above a 13 year bull channel. I said that there was a 75% chance of a reversal down within 5 months. February is a good candidate for the start of a reversal.<p>What are reasonable downside targets when a market reverses down from above the top of a bull channel? The Emini has already fallen below the 20 bar EMA and it is now at the 20 month EMA. It is back in the March to October 2019 trading range. It was stuck there for 6 months and it might stabilize here again for a month or more.<p>Remember, I have written many times that the Emini would probably be in a trading range this year between 2900 and 3500. So far, this selloff has fallen 16% and about 1% below my 2900 target.<p>There are also targets based on the bull channel. The obvious one is the bottom of the channel. That is the 8 year bull trend line and it is currently around 2600.<p>These targets are based on the technical factors. There is always a 30% chance of a much bigger selloff. That is especially true in light of what I wrote above about the coronavirus pandemic.<h3>What about March?</h3><p>The Emini formed a big outside down bar in February. Its high was above the January high and its low was below the January low.<p>An inside bar often follows an outside bar. Therefore, the March low might stay above the February low. If so, there would be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern on the monthly chart. That is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>However, the monthly chart turned down from the top of a 13 year bull channel. That reduces the chance of much higher prices over the next few months. But because the monthly bull trend has been strong, any selloff will probably end within a few months.<p>The month after a big outside down month often trades below the outside down month. But because February was extremely big and its low is in a support zone, March will probably not be a big bear bar on the monthly chart. There might be more buyers than sellers below the February low.<p>This is especially true since the February low is in the support of last year’s 6 month trading range. If March trades below February and closed near its high, it would be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for April. However, February did significant damage to the bull case. Traders expect the Emini to be sideways to down for at least a couple more months.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Big reversal down from Low 2 top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-weekly-SP500-candlestick-chart-big-breakout-below-Low-2-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-29-6.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly S&amp;P500 candlestick chart big breakout below Low 2 top\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a huge bear bar this week. Last week was a Low 2 sell signal bar on the weekly chart. When this week gapped down, it triggered the sell signal. This week is the entry bar. Since it had a big bear body, it is a strong entry bar. That increases the chance of lower prices over the next few weeks.<p>The Emini broke below the 20 week EMA and then below the yearlong bull trend line. A surprisingly big bear bar usually will have at least a small 2nd leg down. Therefore traders expect sideways to lower prices over the next month.<p>Sometimes a huge Bear Surprise Bar can be a Spike in what will become a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. That means a trend that has at least 3 legs down. The spike is the 1st leg. There is no reversal yet and therefore the spike might grow into a 2 or 3 bar breakout over the coming weeks.<p>What about a bear trap? Can the Emini complete reverse this week’s big bear bar next week? The bulls have a 20% chance of an immediate reversal up like after Christmas 2018. A huge selloff like this typically will have a sharp 1 – 3 bar (week) short covering rally. But the context and the size of this week’s bear bar make it much more likely that the Emini will be sideways to down for at least another month.<p>If I am right about the coronavirus pandemic, the charts could become much more bearish over the next couple months.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Extreme sell climax so short covering rally likely</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-daily-SP500-candlestick-chart-has-extreme-sell-climax-at-support.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-2-29-7.png\" alt=\"Emini daily S&amp;P500 candlestick chart has extreme sell climax at support\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart collapsed this week. It broke below the 3000 Big Round Number and the top of the 2 year trading range. The low was also more than a measured move down from the 2 month trading range. Furthermore, the low was a 16% correction from the high.<p>The Emini is back in the March to October 2019 trading range. For 6 months last year, traders thought that area was a fair price. They still probably think that it is a fair price. Therefore, the Emini might get stuck between 2800 and 3000 for a month or longer.<p>When there is a sell climax down to support, the stop for the bears is far above. They have to reduce their risk. The easiest way is to cover (buy back) some of their shorts.<p>The bears who missed the 1st leg down will sell. Also, the bears who were short, but took profits will sell as well. Finally, many bulls who did not exit are eager to exit on the 1st bounce, hoping to avoid a bigger loss.<h3>Will this be a repeat of the December 2018 climactic reversal up?</h3><p>The bulls are hoping that this reversal up will be like the January 2019 climactic reversal. Markets only rarely go from a strong bear trend to a strong bull trend without forming at least a small trading range and some kind of double bottom. Even if the bulls get several bull days, the 1st leg up will probably be minor. Traders believe that the best the bulls will get over the next few weeks is a trading range.<p>The selloff was surprisingly strong. It is a Bear Surprise Breakout. Traders should expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down after the first short covering rally.<p>What we don’t know is what the market will do once it has that 2nd leg down. If the selloff is just a sharp pullback in a bull trend, the selloff will find support around the low of the current leg. The bulls will try to get a reversal up from a double bottom with the bottom of this current leg down.<h3>Possible Small Pullback Bear Trend</h3><p>The bears correctly see this week as exceptional. They would like the breakout will be a spike in a Spike and Channel Bear Trend or the start of a Small Pullback Bear Trend. This spike down would be the 1st leg down. The bears then would expect at least 2 more legs down. The bulls will then hope for a wedge reversal.<p>But what if the selloff does not have 2 or 3 strong bear legs? It would not be climactic. Instead, it could become a Small Pullback Bear Trend. That can last a long time and fall much further than what traders think is possible. That is what happened in 1929. The market keeps trying to reverse up, but each reversal becomes a small pullback in a bear trend that just keeps selling off.<p>No, this is not going to be a repeat of 1929. That is just an extreme example of the pattern. But there is a 30% chance that this selloff can fall about 30 – 50% down from the high before it ends. It might not end until a worldwide coronavirus vaccine is about ready to become available.<h3>Emini has 50% chance of bear market</h3><p>Again, traders should expect a very strong short covering rally within the next week. It could last 2 – 3 weeks, but it should then stall or reverse. Then, there will another leg sideways to down to test the bottom of the current 1st leg down. At that point, we will find out if the selloff will end or continue down much further.<p>There are far more important technical forces behind this selloff. This is true in terms of the duration and size of the developing move. They will likely affect the market for many months and possibly all year.<p>When there is a Bear Major Surprise like this, there is a 70% chance of at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down and a 60% chance of some kind of measured move down. Traders should expect the market to be sideways to down for at least a month. There is better than a 50% chance that it will continue for several months and reach at least 20%. That is the definition of a bear market. Remember, there is a 30% chance of a 30 – 50% selloff this year.<h3>What to expect next week</h3><p>I want to be very clear about one point. It is naive and convenient to say that the coronavirus is the sole or even major reason for this selloff. If it was just coronavirus, the market would have fallen only 5% and the selloff would quickly end because the coronavirus story will be minor within a couple months.<p>There are more important technical forces at work here. Remember, in December, long before the coronavirus was in the news, I said that the monthly chart should reverse down within 5 months because of a failed breakout above the monthly bull channel. This and the other technical factors that I mentioned above could affect the market for many months and possibly the rest of the year.<p>The fundamental factor of the coronavirus pandemic is difficult to assess with current information. Since I think the only solution is a vaccine and that is many months away, the fundamental problem might get much worse than what medical and financial experts are now saying.<p>An initial short covering rally often lasts only a couple days. Traders should expect at least a couple big bull trend days next week. This is true even if March briefly trades below the February low early in the week. But because this selloff was extreme, the rally could be big and last 2 – 3 weeks. It will probably make traders wonder if the repeat of the January 2019 rally. But it will not be.
