It could gap above the November high. That would create a rare gap up to a new all-time high on the monthly chart. While I haven’t checked, this might be the 1st time in history that this has happened on either the Emini or the S&amp;P futures contracts.<p>A gap up on the monthly chart always comes with a gap up on the daily chart. Whenever there is a gap up, there is an increased chance of a trend day. It can be in either direction.<p>When the gap is up and there is a trend, a bull trend is slightly more likely. The bigger the gap, the more likely there will be a bull trend.<p>If there is a series of strong trend bars on the open in either direction, there will be an increased chance of a trend day. Because this is happening at the top of a buy climax and in the final month of the year, there is also an increased chance that a trend day today could be followed by several more trend days in the same direction.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 34 points in the Globex session. It should gap above yesterday’s high and it might gap above the November high to a new all-time high.<p>Since the Emini is doing something very unusual, there is an increased chance of it continuing to do something extreme. That means a trend in either direction. If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, traders will look for a trend day.<p>The bears want the gap up to fail. They want a selloff to far below yesterday’s high.<p>However, the bulls want today to be the start of a strong rally into 2021. If they can get a strong bull trend day, traders will wonder if today is the start of a strong leg u,p and a strong final month of the year.<p>What happens if today is a small, sideways day? Then traders will conclude that the market is putting the decision off until tomorrow or later in the week. It is common for the market to go sideways for 2 to 3 days after a gap up above, or below a key price before resuming or reversing.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-1.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-testing-top-of-trading-range-but-wedge-rally-and-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-1-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart formed a bear reversal bar yesterday after a strong breakout above the September 10 high. But today so far did not fall below yesterday’s low to trigger the sell signal. The bulls are hoping that yesterday was just a pullback from Friday’s strong breakout above the September 10 high.<p>Even though yesterday was a bear reversal bar, it was the 2nd consecutive close above that resistance. That increases the chance that the rally will continue to above the September 1 two-year high.<p>But if today or tomorrow reverses down to below yesterday’s low, the bears will have a micro double top. That would also trigger the sell signal for a wedge rally to a double top with the September 1 high. Traders would then look for a couple legs down to at least the November 23 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market opened above yesterday’s low and reversed up in a tight bull channel. There was a 20-pip pullback 5 hours ago, and that could be the start of a trading range. The bears will start to look for scalps on reversals down. If a reversal down is strong, the bears will hold for a swing down. They will hope that today will form a reversal day, and a double top with yesterday’s high.<p>However, the day is still a bull trend day and it is therefore easier to make money buying pullbacks. The bulls have already accomplished all that they need to do. That reduces the chance of a big rally from here.<p>They prevented the sell signal on the daily chart from triggering, and they reversed most of yesterday’s selloff. They would simply like today to close near its high. If it closed above yesterday’s high, that would also be the 1st close above 1.20 in over 2 years. Today would then be a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>What happens if today closes in the middle of its range? The bulls would be disappointed and the bears will be hopeful. It would increase the chance of another sideways day. The chart would be in a small Breakout Mode pattern. Traders would still be deciding between a break above the September 1 high and a reversal down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-parabolic-wedge-and-higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge and higher high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is now a rare gap up on the monthly chart to a new all-time high. The bulls hope this is the start of a strong rally that will have at least a couple legs up and reach 4,000, which is about a measured move up above the 4 month trading range.<p>When there is a gap above major resistance, like to a new high, the Emini often goes sideways for a few days as traders decide if the breakout will succeed or fail. If there is a gap down tomorrow or anytime soon, the bears will have an island top. Because it would be at a new high, it would have an increased chance of leading to a swing down. This is also true if there is a big bear day this week that closes today’s gap.<p>Today rallied on the open but reversed at the end of the day. It closed in the middle of the range. This is like most days in November, which closed in the middle of the range or near the open.<p>Because today was mostly sideways, there is an increased chance of more sideways trading tomorrow. But because the Emini is breaking out at the end of the year, there is an increased chance of a series of trend days in either direction.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

A gap up to a new all-time high on the monthly chart is rare. I don’t know if it has ever happened before in the history of the Emini or the S&amp;P futures market. That makes it more emotional, which increases the chance of either a strong leg up from here or of a reversal down.<p>It is important to note that while the gap was big on the daily chart, it was small on the monthly chart. Small gaps typically close before the end of the bar, which means before the end of the month.<p>When there is a big gap up above major resistance, like on the daily chart, the Emini often goes sideways for a few days before traders decide if the bull trend will continue or reverse. With yesterday having a a close near the open, there is indecision. That increases the chance of more sideways trading again today. However, because the Emini is overbought and gapping up, there is an increased chance of a series of trend days in either direction.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 11 points in the Globex session. That is just above the November high. Remember, the gap on the monthly chart was small, and it will therefore probably close before the end of the month. That does not mean that December will reverse down. It only means that it might test below the November high. It could then continue sideways or resume up.<p>While yesterday is a sell signal bar for today, it is a weak doji bar in a bull trend. That reduces the chance of a big bear trend day. But it had a small bull body, and that reduces the chance of a big bull trend day.<p>The past 4 days each reversed. Most days over the past month have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Day traders will expect that again today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-parabolic-wedge-and-higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge and higher high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-above-4-month-trading-range-needs-follow-through-buying.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-2-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart formed a big bull trend bar yesterday, and it closed far above the top of the 4-month trading range. The bulls hope that it will lead to a 400-pip measured move up and a test of the February 2018 high at around 1.25.<p>The day after a breakout is important since all strong breakouts fail at least 40% of the time. If today is a 2nd consecutive big bull day closing on its high, traders will expect the rally to reach that February 2018 high. So far, today is a small day that is trading around the open. It is therefore a doji bar on the daily chart. The odds of higher prices will continue to be better than 50% if today does not have a bear body. If today is a big bear day closing on its low, this breakout will probably fail.<p>What happens most often is a follow-through bar that is somewhat neutral. That means a bar that is not strongly bullish or bearish. If that is the case, it will favor higher prices. But it will be less certain than if today is a big bull trend day.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight rallied a little, sold off a little, and is now back around the open. So far, it is a trading range day. Day traders are scalping in both directions.<p>While it is still possible that today could be a big trend day up or down, it probably will not be. But with yesterday as bullish as it was, day traders will probably have an easier time making money by buying. Unless the bears get a strong, sustained selloff, traders expect higher prices over the next several days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-weak-bull-trend-despite-consecutive-wedge-tops.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull trend despite consecutive wedge tops\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The Emini rallied in a weak bull trend and then was sideways for several hours. The bulls got brief trend resumption up and closed near the high.<p>Since today is a bull day and it closed near its high, it is a High 1 buy signal bar for tomorrow. With the daily, weekly, and monthly charts being in bull trends, the odds favor higher prices. But most days for over a month have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Also, most have had a lot of trading range price action. Day traders will expect more tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday closed on its high, and it is a High 1 buy signal bar for today, just below Tuesday’s all-time high. Today will probably trade above yesterday’s high to trigger the buy signal.<p>However, with most days for over a month having intraday reversals, traders will look for at least one reversal today. Therefore, the odds are against a big bull day today, despite a High 1 buy signal on the daily chart.<p>Can today be a bear day? Yesterday was a bull channel on the 5-minute chart and a bull channel is a bear flag. But even if the bears get a break below the channel, traders will expect a lot of trading range trading, like most days for over a month.<p>If there is an early series of strong trend bars up or down, traders will look for a trend. However, they know the odds are that it will not last all day.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down a couple points in the Globex session. If the day session opens around here, traders will expect that today will go above yesterday’s high. That would trigger the High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart.<p>But because yesterday was in a bull channel, there should be a swing down at some point today. Bull channels can sometimes last 2 to 3-days, but most do not. A bull channel usually evolves into a trading range, and that requires a break below the bull trend line. Therefore, there will probably be at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading today.<p>However, remember that most days for over a month have had swings up and down. Therefore, traders will expect that again today, even if there is a trend up or down on the open.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-weak-bull-trend-despite-consecutive-wedge-tops.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-3.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull trend despite consecutive wedge tops\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-strong-breakout-above-double-top-and-measured-move-targets-above.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-3-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is breaking out strongly above its 4-month trading range. Yesterday was the 2nd consecutive bull day with a big body and closing near its high and above the trading range. That was enough for traders to conclude that the breakout will continue higher and have at least 2 legs up.<p>A pullback can begin at any time. The bulls will start to take some profits soon. If the profit-taking lasts more than a day, there will be a pullback.<p>But traders will buy the pullback. The bulls who missed the move are eager to get long. The bears who are short are desperate to get out with a smaller loss.<p>With both the bulls and bears wanting to buy, the 1st pullback should be brief. Traders will not expect more than a 3-day pullback until after there has been a 2nd leg up to resistance.<p>The nearest resistance comes from 2 measured move targets. The nearer one is at 1.2206, which is based on the breakout above the small wedge from November 23 to November 30. The higher one is 1.2236, which is based on the breakout above the double top of October 21 and November 9. There are other higher targets as well. The most important is the February 2018 high of 1.2555.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market went sideways and then up overnight. Even though today is currently a big bull bar on the daily chart, there is an expanding triangle on the 5-minute chart. That means that the bulls are starting to take some profits. It increases the chance of more sustained profit taking coming within a few days.<p>Therefore, the bears should soon get a swing down on the 5-minute chart. But, as I said, even if the selloff is strong on the 5-minute chart, traders will buy the 1st 1 to 3-day pullback on the daily chart.<p>Because of the overnight trading range, day traders will be willing to sell for scalps today. The rally over the past 3 hours has been strong. Most daytraders will not sell until the chart starts to go sideways again. And even then, they will only scalp unless there is a strong reversal down.<p>With the daily and weekly charts being strongly bullish, most day traders will focus on buying pullbacks than on selling rallies.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trading-range-day-and-doji-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day and doji day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It made another new high and then a new low. It closed near the open. Remember, most of the days over the past 5 weeks either closed near the open or the middle of the day’s range.<p>While that is often neutral, there is now a micro wedge top over the past 10 days, and today is a sell signal bar. Since the 10-day bull channel is tight and today did not close on the low, this is not a strong sell setup. But with the bad bull flags on the weekly and monthly charts, traders are looking for a reversal down at some point in December or early January.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, it closed 1 tick above yesterday’s close, and therefore made a new all-time highest close. This is a subtle sign of strong bulls and it reduces the chance of a big selloff today.<p>There are now 3 legs up from the November 19 low. A reversal down from here would be from a wedge top. Since yesterday was a bull doji bar, it is a weak sell signal bar. But with the bad bull flags on the weekly and monthly charts, traders should be prepared for a reversal down some time in December or early January. There could be a dramatic 1 to 3-day buy climax (blow–off top) before the reversal down begins.<p>Is yesterday’s wedge top the start of a selloff? The 10-day bull channel has been tight and there were no strong bear bars in the rally. Therefore, a reversal down would probably just be another 1 to 2-day pullback in a 2-week Small Pullback Bull Trend instead of the start of a reversal down. Traders continue to expect higher prices, fully aware that a profit-taking selloff can start at any time, and that one will probably come in December.<p>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important. There is no significant nearby weekly resistance. But the bulls would like the week to close on its high and above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>The bears would like this week to have a bear body on the weekly chart. However, the open of the week is more than 40 points down from yesterday’s close. That might be too far to reach today. At a minimum, they would like this week to close at least 20 points below this week’s high. That would put a conspicuous tail on the top of this week’s candlestick and slightly reduce the chance of higher prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is unchanged in the Globex session. Yesterday was an expanding triangle on the 5-minute chart. Today is opening in the middle of that trading range. Most days for over a month have had a lot of trading range price action. Furthermore, the majority closed either in the middle of their range or near the open. Day traders expect that again today.<p>If there is a series of strong trend bars, they will look for a possible trend day. But with most days lately having reversals, they will look for any swing to end within 1 – 3 hours, and then either enter a trading range or reverse.<p>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The most important downside magnets (support) are last week’s high and the open of the week. The bulls want the week to close at a new all-time high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trading-range-day-and-doji-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-4.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day and doji day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-at-measured-move-targets.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-4-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has broken strongly above a 4-month trading range. Traders expect at least a 2nd leg up. They therefore will buy the 1st reversal down.<p>When a strong breakout reaches resistance, traders begin to take some profits. The EURUSD is at a measured move projection based on the September 25/November 4 double bottom. Yesterday’s bar has a tail on top, which is a sign of minor profit-taking.<p>There are other measured move targets above. When there are several ways to draw the projections, there is no consensus. That makes the targets less important resistance.<p>The most important resistance is the February 2018 lower high above 1.25 (not shown). There will be a pullback before the EURUSD gets there. The pullback could dip below the September 1 high, which is the breakout point of this week’s rally.<p>However, when a rally is as strong as this one has been, traders are eager to buy. Many will buy as soon as the EURUSD dips below the low of the prior day. The 1st pullback usually lasts only 1 – 3 days.<p>But after there is a 2nd leg up, if there is then a reversal down, there will be a double top. The bears would then have a better chance of a pullback lasting a week or two. Regardless, traders will buy it. They expect a test of 1.25 sometime next year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has had a lot of trading range trading overnight. It reversed down from above yesterday’s high. Yesterday reversed down into the close at a measured move target on the daily chart.<p>This is minor profit taking. Since the daily chart is strongly bullish, day traders are buying pullbacks for scalps. Now that yesterday had been a 40-pip reversal down, they are also looking to sell reversals down for scalps.<p>Can today be a big bear trend day? Probably not. A strong bull trend typically evolves into a trading range before it can reverse into a bear trend. Therefore, today will likely simply continue yesterday’s trading range. Day traders expect to look to buy reversals up and sell reversals down. But if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, they will swing trade.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trend-resumption-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trend resumption up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If worked higher in the final hour and the day, but reversed down from the 3700 Big Round Number.<p>With the week closing near its high and at a new all-time high, traders expect higher prices on Monday. It also increases the chance of a gap up on Monday, which would create a gap on the weekly chart.<p>But while there is no top yet, the Emini will probably have a reversal down at some point in December.

id=\"0-market-overview-weekend-market-analysis\">Market Overview: Weekend Market Analysis</h2><p>The<strong>SP500 Emini</strong>futures have rallied for a month, but there are problems with the rally on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. There is a nested wedge rally at a measured move target on the daily chart. Traders should expect a pullback to below 3400 to begin in December.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are probably in a bear trend that will last for a decade. They are currently at the apex of a triangle, and a bear breakout is more likely.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex broke far above the 4-month trading range that formed after a strong summer rally. Traders expect a test of the February 2018 high above 1.25 in 2021. But the EURUSD might pull back to test the September high, or even the November low first.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-are-at-apex-of-a-triangle-on-weekly-chart\">Bond futures are at apex of a triangle on<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bond-futures-on-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-triangle-or-wedge-and-should-break-below-9-month-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-5.png\" alt=\"Bond futures on weekly candlestick chart in triangle or wedge and should break below 9-month trading range\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures market has been sideways for 9 months after a reversal down in March from the most extreme buy climax in history. The trading range has lower highs, and is therefore a triangle (or a wedge). That does not change the probabilities for the direction of the eventual breakout because every trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. However, it is often a sign that a breakout might be imminent.<p>It is important to know some generalities about Breakout Mode patterns. The 1st breakout of a Breakout Mode pattern has a 50% chance of failing. Furthermore, there is a about a 50% chance that once there is a successful breakout, it will be up, and about a 50% chance that it will be down. Finally, there are often several failed breakouts before there is a successful breakout. The failed breakouts simply increase the height of the trading range.<h3 id=\"3-will-the-breakout-be-up-or-down\">Will the breakout be up or down?</h3><p>I wrote many times since March that the bond market would probably be in a tight range for the remainder of 2020, which it has been. When there is a reversal down from an extreme buy climax, traders expect at least a couple legs sideway, which usually takes about 10 bars. Since this buy climax was also on the monthly chart (not shown), I have been saying that the trading range would probably last at least a year.<p>After a 30-year rally and a reversal down from a massive buy climax, the bond market will be lower 5 and 10 years from now. However, it could easily test the August high at the top of the trading range first. Currently, it probably will not. It is even possible that it could rally briefly above the March high before the bear trend begins, but that is unlikely.<h3 id=\"4-trading-ranges-can-last-a-long-time\">Trading ranges can last a long time</h3><p>The chart could remain sideways for another year or more before it clearly trends down strongly. Also, it could work back up to the top of the trading range at the August high before falling further. Finally, it could break out below, and then rally for many weeks before resuming down. The bonds market is in a trading range, so traders are open to anything, and nothing is high probability over the short-run.<p>Are there characteristics about this trading range that make a bear breakout more likely? Yes. The most important is the strong reversal down in March from the most extreme buy climax in history. While the bond market has not resumed up in 9 months, it also has not retraced much of the 2-year extreme rally. That makes it likely that it will retrace more.<p>Also, the selloff for the past 5 months has been in a tight bear channel. That is a strong, sustained leg down. It increases the chance of a bear breakout. But if the bulls get a strong reversal up within the next few weeks, traders will then look for a rally to the middle of the trading range.<p>As I said, bonds will be down for years. That does not mean straight down. There will be many strong rallies. Since the bond futures are at the bottom of a trading range, they might rally for a month or two before resuming down. But they are going down.<h3 id=\"5-the-appearance-of-the-breakout-bars-is-important\">The appearance of the breakout bars is important</h3><p>If there is a bear breakout, traders will pay attention to what the bars look like. If there are consecutive big bear bars closing on their lows, and far below the June low, traders will look for at least a couple legs down and a test of the next support. That is the March low.<p>But if the breakout reverses up strongly either immediately, or within a couple bars, traders will look for a test of the top of the trading range at the August high.<p>If the breakout is unclear, the bond market will likely go sideways for a few bars before traders decide whether it will succeed or fail.<h3 id=\"6-what-about-zero-interest-rates\">What about zero interest rates?</h3><p>I want to remind readers that until a few months ago, the idiots on TV were still saying that we would have negative interest rates in the U.S. and that bonds were therefore going higher. I repeatedly said for over a year that this was wrong, and that the<a aria-label=\"US public would never allow the government to have negative interest rates (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">US public would never allow the government to have negative interest rates</a>.<p>This is still true. The U.S. will not have negative interest rates. In fact, the TV clowns have finally stopped their catchy chant of “interest rates to zero and gold to infinity.” Just because something sounds clever does not make it true.<h2 id=\"7-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"8-eurusd-weekly-chart-broke-strongly-above-its-4-month-trading-range\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart broke strongly above its 4-month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-on-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-breakout-above-4-month-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-5-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex on weekly candlestick chart in breakout above 4-month trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart this week broke far above the September high. This increases the chance of follow-through buying next week. If next week is a 2nd consecutive big bull bar, traders will look for a test of the February 2018 major lower high around 1.25 within a couple months.<p>Next week is the follow-through bar. If it is not clearly bullish or bearish, the EURUSD might go sideways for a week or two before deciding whether to continue up or reverse down. At the moment, there is a 60% chance it will go higher, unless next week is a bear bar closing on its low.<p>If next week is a big bear bar closing on its low, traders will conclude that the breakout failed. They would then think that the reversal is a wedge top, where the March 9 and September 1 highs were the 1st 2 legs up. They would expect a couple legs sideways to down, to at least the breakout point at the September 1 high. It could test the November 4 low at the bottom of the 3rd leg up.<p>The rally is already at a minor resistance level, which is a measured move based on the height of the November 4 bar. That was a 2nd consecutive outside bar on the weekly chart, and traders expected the breakout to reach a measured move. That means that their could be a minor pullback here. However, traders expect higher prices and they will buy the 1st pullback, unless it is a strong reversal down.<h2 id=\"9-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"10-monthly-emini-chart-has-buy-climax-above-weak-bull-flag\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has buy climax above weak bull flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-stock-index-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-weak-ioi-High-1-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 stock index futures monthly candlestick chart breaking above weak ioi High 1 bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a huge bull bar in November. It closed above the October high and at a new all-time high.<p>December gapped up, which meant there was a gap up to a new all-time high on the monthly chart. That is extremely rare. While I did not check, it might be the only time in the history of the Emini and S&amp;P futures.<p>However, the gap on the monthly chart was small. Small gaps typically close before the bar is complete. This gapped closed when Wednesday dipped below the November high.<h3 id=\"11-follow-through-after-a-breakout-is-important\">Follow-through after a breakout is important</h3><p>December is important because it is the bar after a breakout. It is the follow-through bar, and its appearance can change expectations of traders for the coming months. If December is a big bull bar closing on its high, traders will expect at least 2 legs up. This is the most bullish outcome. Traders would hope for a 400-point measured move up based on the height of the 4-month trading range.<p>The bears want December to be a big bear bar closing on its low. Traders would then assume that November was a bull trap, and they would look for a reversal down.<p>Most likely, December will not be either a strong bull or bear bar. Anything other than a strong bear bar will leave traders expecting sideways to up trading in January.<h3 id=\"12-dont-forget-that-the-high-1-buy-signal-bar-was-a-bear-bar\">Don’t forget that the High 1 buy signal bar was a bear bar</h3><p>I mentioned at the end of October that October was a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar, but that it had a bear body. Also, it was a 2nd consecutive bear bar, and the bull flag was coming late in a bull trend.<p>That combination is not good for the bulls. Usually a bull breakout will only last for a bar (month) or two, and then there is a reversal sideways to down. The reversal down typically has at least a couple legs and lasts at least 5 bars. Since this is a monthly chart, 5 months is about half of a year. Consequently, traders should expect 2021 to be sideways to down for the 1st half of the year, whether or not the Emini continues up into January.<p>This particular High 1 was an inside bar after an outside bar. It is therefore also an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. A Breakout Mode pattern late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag.<p>The bulls hope that any pullback will form a triangle, which would be another bull flag. However, the bears want a reversal down from a higher high micro double top with the September high.<p>The important point is that traders should expect that there will not be strong, protracted buying in the coming months. Instead, they should watch for a reversal down in either December or January. For example, December could rally and sell off, which would create a bear reversal bar.<p>Alternatively, it could simply be sideways and in a small range, and close near the open. While that is not a strong sell signal bar, it could be the start of a couple legs sideways to down.<h2 id=\"13-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-wedge-rally-at-measured-move-target\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has wedge rally at measured move target</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-stock-index-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-rally-to-measured-move-target-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-5-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 stock index futures weekly candlestick chart has wedge rally to measured move target\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has had consecutive bull bars after breaking above a High 1 bull flag last week. However, the buy signal bar was a bear bar, and it was a 2nd consecutive bear bar.<p>This is similar to what is taking place on the monthly chart. When there is a weak bull flag coming late in a bull trend, the rally usually fails within about 2 bars. This week was the 2nd bar. That increases the chance of a reversal down next week.<p>What about the consecutive bull bars? Yes, they increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week. With this week closing near its high, next week might even gap up on the weekly chart. While unlikely at the moment, the Emini might reach the 3884 measured move target based on the September/October double bottom. But a 3rd consecutive strong bull bar would be unusual in this situation. Therefore, if this coming week rallies, traders should look for a reversal down later in the week.<h3 id=\"14-wedge-rally-to-measured-move-target\">Wedge rally to measured move target</h3><p>There is a credible wedge rally from the September low. What makes it particularly important is that this week is also at a measured move target.<p>When there is a bull trend and a reversal down, the reversal down fails and the bull trend resumes. If that happens, you should assume that the reversal down was testing something.<p>What did it test? Look to the left. The June low was a test of the April high. The Emini reversed back up from just above that high, and therefore that high is important. There is now a gap between those 2 prices. Two important prices often lead to a measured move, which is then a 3rd important price.<p>If you project up from the March pandemic low to the bottom of the gap at the April high, the measured move target is 3694. The Emini poked above it on Friday, and closed just above it.<p>Yes, this week was also a test of the 3700 Big Round Number, but that gap is important. If the bears get a sell signal bar next week, that measured move target increases the chance of a couple legs down.<h3 id=\"15-if-there-is-a-reversal-down-where-is-support\">If there is a reversal down, where is support?</h3><p>The September/October trading range had both a double bottom and a double top. A symmetrical trading range late in a bull trend is an area of agreement. If the market breaks above it, it usually gets pulled back to the middle or bottom of the range. That range is often the Final Bull Flag.<p>The middle of the range is between 3400 and 3500. If the selloff is strong, traders will expect a test of the bottom of the range, which is around 3200.<h2 id=\"16-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-nested-wedge-rally-but-no-sell-signal-bar-yet\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has nested wedge rally, but no sell signal bar yet</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-stock-index-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-nested-wedge-rally-at-top-of-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-5-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 stock index futures daily candlestick chart has nested wedge rally at top of trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied strongly from the September/October double bottom. This week broke above a 3-week trading range to a new all-time high.<p>But there is something wrong with the daily chart, in addition to the bad bull flags on the weekly and monthly charts. It’s the bars. In a bull trend that lasts a long time, at least half of the bars in the legs up have closes on or near their highs. Since late October, most of the bars have closed in the middle or near the open.<p>Neutral bars like that are much more common when a rally is a leg in a trading range. Bull legs in trading ranges lead to bear legs. While it is certainly possible that the November rally could accelerate up in December and begin a clear bull trend, it is currently more likely that it will lead to a bear leg in the 4-month trading.<p>Sometimes a market will accelerate up for a few days and then collapse. That is a blow-off top, and a buy climax like that often is the start of a swing down.<p>But didn’t this week break above the 4-week range, which is at the top of the 4-month range? It did, but most trading ranges that last 20 or more bars have at least one failed breakout. That means a new high or new low that reverses. The longer a trading range lasts, the more likely there will be a breakout up or down that fails.<h3 id=\"17-nested-wedge-rally\">Nested wedge rally</h3><p>There is another problem with the rally. There are 3 small pushes up over the past 3 weeks. A reversal down would make traders view the rally as a wedge.<p>A small wedge usually leads to a minor reversal down. But this small wedge is nested within a bigger wedge that began with the October 12 high. A nested wedge pattern has a higher probability of leading to a reversal down, and the reversal down tends to be deeper and last longer. Finally, remember that this is coming at the resistance of the measured move target on the weekly chart, and the 3700 Big Round Number.<p>If the bears get a reversal down next week, traders should expect it to be fairly deep and last at least a couple weeks. As I wrote above, reasonable targets are the middle and the bottom of the 4-month trading range.<p>But what if there is no reversal? The market has been rallying strongly for a month. The bulls will look for a measured move up to 4,000 – based on the 400-point tall trading range that began in September.<h3 id=\"18-is-the-emini-in-a-new-bull-trend\">Is the Emini in a new bull trend?</h3><p>The question is, is the daily chart still in a trading range, or has the breakout been convincing enough so that traders believe there is now a new bull trend? Unless the bulls start to get more and consecutive bull bars closing near their highs, this week’s breakout will fail. Traders will see it as a new high in the 4-month trading range, and they will look for a reversal down. With everyone on TV so bullish, if the Emini starts down, it could fall quickly as everyone suddenly realizes that they are long at the top of a trading range.<p>But if the Emini begins to form many bull bars closing on their highs, then traders will conclude that the rally is in fact the start of a new leg up. The target above is the 4,000 Big Round Number, which is about a measured move up from the 4-month trading range.<p>If the Emini reverses down soon, how far down will it go? At a minimum, traders will look for it to get back to the middle of the 4-month range. That is around 3400, and it is below the November 10 higher low. Traders should not be surprised if it goes all the way below the 3200 bottom of the range.<p>Remember what I wrote about the monthly chart. It looks like the Emini will be sideways to down for the 1st half of 2021, even if it goes higher into January. If so, the Emini should get down to the bottom of the range by mid-year, and probably sooner.<h2 id=\"19-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Additionally, there are 5 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart, and last week closed at a new all-time high. That makes at least slightly higher prices likely this week. But 5 consecutive bull bars is fairly unusual and it therefore increases the chance of a bear bar today or tomorrow.<p>One problem that the bulls have is that the High 1 buy signal from 3 weeks ago on the weekly chart had 2 bear bars. That is a weak buy setup. Normally, a rally from a weak bull flag only lasts about a couple bars. Last week was the 2nd bar. That increases the chance that this week will be sideways to down.<p>As I mentioned over the weekend, there will probably be a reversal down at least to the midpoint of the 4-month trading range beginning at some point in December, and it can come at any time. The rally over the past 2 weeks is a micro wedge on the daily chart. That increases the chance of a reversal down starting this week.<h3>Most day’s have had reversals for over a month</h3><p>Most days for the past 6 weeks have closed either around the middle or near the open. That means that they have had swings up and down on the 5-minute chart. Day traders will expect that again today. But if there is a series of strong trend bars today in either direction, they will look for a trend day.<p>Also, the rally from late October only had one pair of big bull bars closing near their highs. With Friday closing near its high, this reduces the chance that today will be a 2nd consecutive big bull day closing near its high. If today is near the high after 11 a.m. PST, day traders will look for at least a minor late selloff.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 9 points in the Globex session. Today will therefore open around Friday’s 5-hour trading range. Because traders thought that this was an area where the price was fair on Friday, there is an increased chance that today will go sideways in that range on today’s open. Day traders will then look for a double bottom or wedge bottom for a swing up, or for a double top or wedge rally for a swing down.<p>But, consecutive big bull trend days have been rare for 2 months. That reduces the chance that today will be a strong bull trend day.<p>Can today begin a December selloff? A selloff can come at any time. However, it usually does not begin after 5 consecutive bull days. Therefore, traders will expect the Emini to go sideways for at least a couple days, before there is a swing down on the daily chart.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trend-resumption-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-7.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trend resumption up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-1st-pullback-in-bull-micro-channel-so-high-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-7-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex 1st pullback in bull micro channel so high 1 bull flag buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart formed a micro double top on Thursday and Friday, at a measured move projection up from a double bottom. There were 10 bars without a pullback, which means the rally was a 10-bar bull micro channel. That is extreme and therefore a buy climax at resistance, which typically attracts some profit-taking.<p>Friday was a bear bar closing near its low. Traders see it as a sell signal bar for a buy climax at resistance.<p>However, after 10 days where the bulls were happy to buy above the low of the prior day, they finally got an opportunity to buy below the low of the prior day. Many bulls who missed the rally will be eager to buy this 1st pullback.<p>The pullback can last a few days, but traders expect a test back up to last week’s high at a minimum. However, extreme moves typically lead to trading ranges. While traders expect higher prices a month from now, the EURUSD might begin to go sideways over the next week or two.<h3>Can the rally fail?</h3><p>Can the breakout fail and and become a bull trap? A reversal is always possible, but it becomes less likely when a breakout has several consecutive bull bars closing near their highs and far above resistance, like this one. Consequently, even if the bears get a sharp reversal down to below the September 1 high at the top of the 4-month trading range, the selloff will probably just be a breakout test.<p>The best the bears can probably get over the next couple weeks is a minor reversal, which means a bear leg in a trading range. The bottom of the range should be around the September 1 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to below Friday’s low overnight, but reversed up to above Friday’s low. The bulls want today to close near its high. Today would then be a strong buy signal bar for the 1st pullback in 10 days. This would be a good High 1 bull flag buy setup, and it would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices for tomorrow.<p>If today closes near its low, which is unlikely, traders will expect lower prices tomorrow. That would increase the chance of a 2 to 3-day pullback.<p>Finally, what happens if today closes in the middle and around yesterday’s low? Traders would expect another sideways day tomorrow.<h3>Today’s open might be magnet for remainder of the session</h3><p>Day traders will fight today over how today will close. After the 60-pip rally up from below yesterday’s low, today will probably not be a bear trend day. Traders will buy pullbacks.<p>But today is already back to the middle of Friday’s range, and above the open of the day. The bulls do not need more than this to create a reasonable buy setup for tomorrow. That reduces the chance that the rally will continue much higher. The bulls will probably look to buy 20 to 30-pip pullbacks for the remainder of the day.<p>The bears had their chance but could not sustain the selling. However, they suspect that today will evolve into a trading range. Therefore, once the reversal up stalls, bear day traders will look to sell reversals down for 10-pip scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The lower range was a test of the 60 minute EMA.<p>On the daily chart, today was a bear inside bar. It is therefore a sell signal bar for tomorrow. There is a small wedge rally over the past 2 weeks on the daily chart, and it is nested within a 2-month wedge top. But because today is only a doji, it is a low probability sell signal bar.<p>I have been saying that the Emini should reverse down to around 3200 to 3400 in December or January. However, saying that any of the many reversals down is the start of a bear trend is a low probability bet unless the pattern is strong. This is a weak sell setup in a 2-week Small Pullback Bull Trend. The past 5 days had bull bodies. There are probably buyers not far below today’s low.<p>But, there is probably not much left to this leg in the bull trend on the daily chart. If there bears get a better top or a strong reversal down, traders will expect at least a couple small legs down to below 3400.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This would be a good High 1 bull flag buy setup, and it would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices for tomorrow.<p>If today closes near its low, which is unlikely, traders will expect lower prices tomorrow. That would increase the chance of a 2 to 3-day pullback.<p>Finally, what happens if today closes in the middle and around yesterday’s low? Traders would expect another sideways day tomorrow.<h3>Today’s open might be magnet for remainder of the session</h3><p>Day traders will fight today over how today will close. After the 60-pip rally up from below yesterday’s low, today will probably not be a bear trend day. Traders will buy pullbacks.<p>But today is already back to the middle of Friday’s range, and above the open of the day. The bulls do not need more than this to create a reasonable buy setup for tomorrow. That reduces the chance that the rally will continue much higher. The bulls will probably look to buy 20 to 30-pip pullbacks for the remainder of the day.<p>The bears had their chance but could not sustain the selling. However, they suspect that today will evolve into a trading range. Therefore, once the reversal up stalls, bear day traders will look to sell reversals down for 10-pip scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The lower range was a test of the 60 minute EMA.<p>On the daily chart, today was a bear inside bar. It is therefore a sell signal bar for tomorrow. There is a small wedge rally over the past 2 weeks on the daily chart, and it is nested within a 2-month wedge top. But because today is only a doji, it is a low probability sell signal bar.<p>I have been saying that the Emini should reverse down to around 3200 to 3400 in December or January. However, saying that any of the many reversals down is the start of a bear trend is a low probability bet unless the pattern is strong. This is a weak sell setup in a 2-week Small Pullback Bull Trend. The past 5 days had bull bodies. There are probably buyers not far below today’s low.<p>But, there is probably not much left to this leg in the bull trend on the daily chart. If there bears get a better top or a strong reversal down, traders will expect at least a couple small legs down to below 3400.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is a sell signal bar for a nested wedge top on the daily chart. But yesterday was only a bear doji, and the prior 5 days had bull bodies. Also, the bull channel has been tight. Traders see this as a minor sell signal in a Small Pullback Bull Trend and expect that there will be buyers not far below. However, if today is a big bear day on the daily chart, it could still be the start of a 2-week correction down to below 3400, even with a strong sell signal bar.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 14 points in the Globex session. It therefore will open around yesterday’s low. It might even gap down. But if it does and the gap is small, the gap will probably close in the 1st hour.<p>Because yesterday was an inside day on the daily chart, it is both a buy and sell signal bar for today. But a doji is a weak signal bar. There might be more buyers than sellers below its low, and more sellers than buyers above its high. Furthermore, most days for 6 weeks have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Day traders will expect that again today.<h3>Day traders should not trade in tight trading ranges</h3><p>Much of the trading over the past few days has been in tight trading ranges. Most traders will lose money trading in that environment. Traders should be looking for swing trades and entering with stop orders.<p>A tight trading range is a limit order market. The computers are betting on reversals. This means they are selling as the Emini goes up and buying as it goes down. Day traders have to patiently wait for clear reversal setups or brief strong breakouts. Also, they should expect the swings to end in about an hour instead of lasting all day.<p>However, because a reversal is likely in December, a bear trend day can come at any time. It is important to note that whenever a reversal down is likely, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day as well. If too many weak bears are short and the Emini does not go down, a small rally can turn into a big rally as the bears cover their shorts. But with most days being trading range days, a trading range day is more likely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-8.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There were 10 days without a pullback. That is extreme and therefore climactic, and it usually attracts profit-taking.<p>When a rally has been strong, like this one, the 1st reversal down is usually a pullback, which means a bull flag. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg up.<p>Yesterday is a buy signal bar, but it has a bear body. The bulls want today to be a bull bar closing on its high. That would be a higher probability High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. That means there would be a better chance of a resumption of the bull trend for at least a few days.<p>If today triggers the buy signal by going above yesterday’s high, many bulls will not take the buy signal. That is because yesterday had a bear body. Traders are concerned that they might be more sellers than buyers above a bear bar, which means that the pullback might have a 2nd leg down.<p>The bears see the rally as an extreme buy climax. They hope the profit taking is extreme as well. If it is relentless and the EURUSD falls below the September 1 high, and then below the November 9 high, traders will begin to conclude that the breakout has failed and that the bull trend is reversing into a bear trend. There is currently only a 40% chance of this. It is more likely that there will be at least a small 2nd leg up before there is a trend reversal, or a pullback lasting more than a few days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways overnight. The low is above yesterday’s low and the high is below yesterday’s high. Today so far is an inside bar. If it remains an inside bar, it will be a Breakout Mode bar, which means it is both a buy and sell signal bar. The bulls would like it to close on the high, which would make it a better buy signal bar on the daily chart. There would be a better chance that tomorrow will resume last week’s bull trend.<p>The bears want today to close on the low. It would then be a sell signal bar. There would also be 3 consecutive bear bars on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices.<h3>Daytraders have been scalping today</h3><p>Since today so far is a trading range and an inside day, it is neutral. Traders are selling reversals down and buying reversals up, and they are scalping. While it is possible that today could be a big bear day, that is unlikely. Traders were expecting a 1 to 3 day pullback on the daily chart, and then an attempt to resume the bull trend. Today is the 3rd day, and traders are becoming more interested in buying on the daily chart. They will try hard to make today be a buy signal bar. That reduces the chance of a big bear day.<p>Since yesterday is a bear bar on the daily chart and that is not a strong buy signal bar, many bulls will not be eager to buy relentlessly today. But they are hoping that today closes near its high so that today will be a strong buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>What is most likely for the rest of today? It will probably remain sideways and inside of yesterday’s range. Also, it should have at least a small bull body. But the 2 bear bars on the daily chart weakened the bull case. The EURUSD might have to go sideways for another couple days before traders decide between a resumption of the bull trend and a deeper pullback on the daily chart.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-8-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It opened below yesterday’s low, then rallied to the EMA. It sold off, but reverse up again from a double bottom and a test of yesterday’s low.<p>It rallied in a Small Pullback Bull Trend to above yesterday’s high, which meant that today was an outside up day. The rally continued up to a new all-time high.<p>The final leg up was a buy climax, and the Emini reversed back down to the EMA and an earlier trading range, which was the Final Bull Flag.<p>Because today was a buy climax day, traders expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. The day after a strong bull trend day is usually not another strong bull trend. If tomorrow rallies, the Emini will form a weaker bull trend day, like a Trending Trading Range Day.<p>Can tomorrow be a big bear day? There is a slightly increased chance of a big bear day on the day after a big bull day. More likely, the Emini will spend a lot of time in trading ranges tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Furthermore, most days for 6 weeks have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Day traders will expect that again today.<h3>Day traders should not trade in tight trading ranges</h3><p>Much of the trading over the past few days has been in tight trading ranges. Most traders will lose money trading in that environment. Traders should be looking for swing trades and entering with stop orders.<p>A tight trading range is a limit order market. The computers are betting on reversals. This means they are selling as the Emini goes up and buying as it goes down. Day traders have to patiently wait for clear reversal setups or brief strong breakouts. Also, they should expect the swings to end in about an hour instead of lasting all day.<p>However, because a reversal is likely in December, a bear trend day can come at any time. It is important to note that whenever a reversal down is likely, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day as well. If too many weak bears are short and the Emini does not go down, a small rally can turn into a big rally as the bears cover their shorts. But with most days being trading range days, a trading range day is more likely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-8.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There were 10 days without a pullback. That is extreme and therefore climactic, and it usually attracts profit-taking.<p>When a rally has been strong, like this one, the 1st reversal down is usually a pullback, which means a bull flag. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg up.<p>Yesterday is a buy signal bar, but it has a bear body. The bulls want today to be a bull bar closing on its high. That would be a higher probability High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. That means there would be a better chance of a resumption of the bull trend for at least a few days.<p>If today triggers the buy signal by going above yesterday’s high, many bulls will not take the buy signal. That is because yesterday had a bear body. Traders are concerned that they might be more sellers than buyers above a bear bar, which means that the pullback might have a 2nd leg down.<p>The bears see the rally as an extreme buy climax. They hope the profit taking is extreme as well. If it is relentless and the EURUSD falls below the September 1 high, and then below the November 9 high, traders will begin to conclude that the breakout has failed and that the bull trend is reversing into a bear trend. There is currently only a 40% chance of this. It is more likely that there will be at least a small 2nd leg up before there is a trend reversal, or a pullback lasting more than a few days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways overnight. The low is above yesterday’s low and the high is below yesterday’s high. Today so far is an inside bar. If it remains an inside bar, it will be a Breakout Mode bar, which means it is both a buy and sell signal bar. The bulls would like it to close on the high, which would make it a better buy signal bar on the daily chart. There would be a better chance that tomorrow will resume last week’s bull trend.<p>The bears want today to close on the low. It would then be a sell signal bar. There would also be 3 consecutive bear bars on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices.<h3>Daytraders have been scalping today</h3><p>Since today so far is a trading range and an inside day, it is neutral. Traders are selling reversals down and buying reversals up, and they are scalping. While it is possible that today could be a big bear day, that is unlikely. Traders were expecting a 1 to 3 day pullback on the daily chart, and then an attempt to resume the bull trend. Today is the 3rd day, and traders are becoming more interested in buying on the daily chart. They will try hard to make today be a buy signal bar. That reduces the chance of a big bear day.<p>Since yesterday is a bear bar on the daily chart and that is not a strong buy signal bar, many bulls will not be eager to buy relentlessly today. But they are hoping that today closes near its high so that today will be a strong buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>What is most likely for the rest of today? It will probably remain sideways and inside of yesterday’s range. Also, it should have at least a small bull body. But the 2 bear bars on the daily chart weakened the bull case. The EURUSD might have to go sideways for another couple days before traders decide between a resumption of the bull trend and a deeper pullback on the daily chart.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-8-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It opened below yesterday’s low, then rallied to the EMA. It sold off, but reverse up again from a double bottom and a test of yesterday’s low.<p>It rallied in a Small Pullback Bull Trend to above yesterday’s high, which meant that today was an outside up day. The rally continued up to a new all-time high.<p>The final leg up was a buy climax, and the Emini reversed back down to the EMA and an earlier trading range, which was the Final Bull Flag.<p>Because today was a buy climax day, traders expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. The day after a strong bull trend day is usually not another strong bull trend. If tomorrow rallies, the Emini will form a weaker bull trend day, like a Trending Trading Range Day.<p>Can tomorrow be a big bear day? There is a slightly increased chance of a big bear day on the day after a big bull day. More likely, the Emini will spend a lot of time in trading ranges tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, there have been consecutive strong bull bars only once since October 12, and that reduces the chance of a 2nd strong bull bar tomorrow.<p>The bull trend is strong on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. There is a Small Pullback Bull Trend on the daily chart since November 10. Traders expect higher prices. But the rally from the October low has been extreme. That typically will attract profit takers.<p>Also, the rally over the past 2 weeks has had several small pushes up in a tight bull channel. It is therefore a micro wedge and a type of buy climax. That increases the chance of at least a several day pullback coming at any time. But until the bears can start to create bear strong bear bars, traders expect the Emini to go higher.<p>I wrote in November that the Emini would probably rally for the 1st couple weeks of December, but there was in increased risk of a reversal down in the 2nd half of the month. It could come sooner, or it could come in the final days of the month.<p>The reason is that the yearly chart (not shown) is at the high of the year and the year is a big outside up bar late in a bull trend. That type of bar typically has a conspicuous tail on top. To get that tail, the Emini will need to drop about 100 points from the high before the end of the year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. It is trading around yesterday’s high and it therefore might gap up to a new all-time high. If so, the gap will be small. Small gaps typically close early in the day.<p>Since yesterday was climactic, day traders expect at least a couple hours of trading range trading to begin by the end of the 2nd hour. If today is a bull day, it will probably be a weaker bull day, like a Trending Trading Range Day or a Broad Bull Channel. On the daily chart, there has only been one instance of consecutive strong bull bars in 2 months. That also reduces the chance of a big bull trend day today.<p>What is most likely? Look back at the bull bars on the daily chart for the past 2 months. Most of the time, the next day was neutral. It either closed near the open or in the middle of the range. That is what is most likely today.<p>With the parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart, a big bear day can come at any time. However, day traders expect a neutral day today. But, most days for over a month have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Day traders will therefore expect that again today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-9.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend and micro wedge\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is at the bottom of a cluster of measured move targets, which are resistance.<p>The breakout was strong enough to make a 2nd leg up likely. But it was also climactic. That often results in a pullback that lasts longer, and is deeper than what traders expect.<p>Yesterday was a High 1 buy signal bar. However, it was the 3rd consecutive bear day. That is a weak buy setup. It might have more sellers than buyers above. The bulls would like a strong buy signal bar, which is a bull bar closing near its high. After 3 bear bars, there will likely be at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>The bears want the breakout to fail. They have a 40% chance. But if they can create a couple big bear bars closing on their lows, the odds will increase to better than 50%. At a minimum, they want a deep pullback, like to below the breakout point, which is the September 1 high.<p>If they get that, the EURUSD will probably enter a trading range for at least 10 to 20 bars. At that point, the bears will have a better chance of creating a reliable top, like a double top.<p>At the moment, the odds favor more sideways to down, and then a continuation up to the February 2018 high above 1.25 at some point next year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market went above yesterday’s high in the European session. That triggered the High 1 bull flag buy signal. However, as expected, there were more sellers than buyers above, and the EURUSD reversed down sharply. It is currently back at the open of the session.<p>The reversal down was strong enough to make a bull trend day unlikely. However, the EURUSD has been sideways for 4 days in a bull trend. That reduces the chance that the selling will continue for the rest of the day. Therefore, traders expect today to remain sideways. Day traders will look to sell reversals down from rallies, buy reversals up from selloffs, and take quick profits. That is trading range price action, and it should lead to a trading range for the remainder of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-down-day-and-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down day and small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today was therefore an outside down day. The Small Pullback Bear Trend evolved into a trading range after consecutive wedge bottoms.<p>Yesterday was an outside up day. Consecutive outside days is an oo (outside-outside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. Many traders will sell below today’s low and buy above today’s high. With the Emini overbought, more traders will be willing to sell.<p>What happens if tomorrow does not go above today’s high or below its low? The buy and sell signals would still be in effect. Sometimes it takes several days to trigger. The day after an outside day often is an inside day. That creates an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is another Breakout Mode setup.<p>If the buy triggers, the OO will probably be a Final Bull Flag because it is coming late in a bull trend. If the sell signal triggers, there is a higher probability of several days down because the Emini is overbought and at resistance.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, there have been consecutive strong bull bars only once since October 12, and that reduces the chance of a 2nd strong bull bar tomorrow.<p>The bull trend is strong on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. There is a Small Pullback Bull Trend on the daily chart since November 10. Traders expect higher prices. But the rally from the October low has been extreme. That typically will attract profit takers.<p>Also, the rally over the past 2 weeks has had several small pushes up in a tight bull channel. It is therefore a micro wedge and a type of buy climax. That increases the chance of at least a several day pullback coming at any time. But until the bears can start to create bear strong bear bars, traders expect the Emini to go higher.<p>I wrote in November that the Emini would probably rally for the 1st couple weeks of December, but there was in increased risk of a reversal down in the 2nd half of the month. It could come sooner, or it could come in the final days of the month.<p>The reason is that the yearly chart (not shown) is at the high of the year and the year is a big outside up bar late in a bull trend. That type of bar typically has a conspicuous tail on top. To get that tail, the Emini will need to drop about 100 points from the high before the end of the year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. It is trading around yesterday’s high and it therefore might gap up to a new all-time high. If so, the gap will be small. Small gaps typically close early in the day.<p>Since yesterday was climactic, day traders expect at least a couple hours of trading range trading to begin by the end of the 2nd hour. If today is a bull day, it will probably be a weaker bull day, like a Trending Trading Range Day or a Broad Bull Channel. On the daily chart, there has only been one instance of consecutive strong bull bars in 2 months. That also reduces the chance of a big bull trend day today.<p>What is most likely? Look back at the bull bars on the daily chart for the past 2 months. Most of the time, the next day was neutral. It either closed near the open or in the middle of the range. That is what is most likely today.<p>With the parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart, a big bear day can come at any time. However, day traders expect a neutral day today. But, most days for over a month have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Day traders will therefore expect that again today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-9.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend and micro wedge\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-weak-High-1-bull-flag-in-buy-climax-at-measured-move-targets.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-9-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weak High 1 bull flag in buy climax at measured move targets\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has gone sideways for 4 days, after a climactic breakout above a 4-month trading range. It is at the bottom of a cluster of measured move targets, which are resistance.<p>The breakout was strong enough to make a 2nd leg up likely. But it was also climactic. That often results in a pullback that lasts longer, and is deeper than what traders expect.<p>Yesterday was a High 1 buy signal bar. However, it was the 3rd consecutive bear day. That is a weak buy setup. It might have more sellers than buyers above. The bulls would like a strong buy signal bar, which is a bull bar closing near its high. After 3 bear bars, there will likely be at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>The bears want the breakout to fail. They have a 40% chance. But if they can create a couple big bear bars closing on their lows, the odds will increase to better than 50%. At a minimum, they want a deep pullback, like to below the breakout point, which is the September 1 high.<p>If they get that, the EURUSD will probably enter a trading range for at least 10 to 20 bars. At that point, the bears will have a better chance of creating a reliable top, like a double top.<p>At the moment, the odds favor more sideways to down, and then a continuation up to the February 2018 high above 1.25 at some point next year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market went above yesterday’s high in the European session. That triggered the High 1 bull flag buy signal. However, as expected, there were more sellers than buyers above, and the EURUSD reversed down sharply. It is currently back at the open of the session.<p>The reversal down was strong enough to make a bull trend day unlikely. However, the EURUSD has been sideways for 4 days in a bull trend. That reduces the chance that the selling will continue for the rest of the day. Therefore, traders expect today to remain sideways. Day traders will look to sell reversals down from rallies, buy reversals up from selloffs, and take quick profits. That is trading range price action, and it should lead to a trading range for the remainder of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-down-day-and-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down day and small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today was therefore an outside down day. The Small Pullback Bear Trend evolved into a trading range after consecutive wedge bottoms.<p>Yesterday was an outside up day. Consecutive outside days is an oo (outside-outside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. Many traders will sell below today’s low and buy above today’s high. With the Emini overbought, more traders will be willing to sell.<p>What happens if tomorrow does not go above today’s high or below its low? The buy and sell signals would still be in effect. Sometimes it takes several days to trigger. The day after an outside day often is an inside day. That creates an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is another Breakout Mode setup.<p>If the buy triggers, the OO will probably be a Final Bull Flag because it is coming late in a bull trend. If the sell signal triggers, there is a higher probability of several days down because the Emini is overbought and at resistance.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was therefore an outside day. Yesterday reversed down from above Tuesday’s high and traded below Tuesday’s low. It was therefore an outside down day. Consecutive outside bars.<p>Consecutive outside days is an OO (outside-outside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. On a smaller time frame, it is an expanding triangle. Many traders will buy above the pattern and sell below. Therefore, yesterday is both a buy and sell signal bar.<p>It sometimes takes a few days for either signal to trigger. The day after a big outside day is often an inside day. That then creates an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is another Breakout Mode setup.<p>When an OO comes late in a bull trend, it is often the Final Bull Flag. Therefore, a bull breakout will probably not get very far before reversing down.<p>Since the Emini is overbought, there is a higher probability that the sell signal could lead to a selloff that could last a week or more. Remember, I have been saying that the Emini would rally in the 1st half of December and then probably reverse down in the 2nd half. This could be the start of that reversal.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Today is rollover day. That means March is now the front month. However, most day traders will continue to trade the December contract today because December will still have much more volume. They will switch to March tomorrow.<p>The bears want today to be a 2nd consecutive big bear day. But the Emini is down only 9 points in the Globex session. While it might gap down, which would trigger the OO sell signal on the daily chart, the gap would be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour and are usually insignificant.<p>The bears want a 2nd consecutive big bear day. However, that only happens 25% of the time on the day after a big sell climax day. If today is a bear day, it will probably be a weaker type of bear trend, like a Trending Trading Range Day or a Broad Bear Channel.<p>Can today reverse up from below yesterday’s low to above yesterday’s high? Today would then be a 3rd consecutive outside day. That is rare and therefore unlikely. However, the bulls would like today to close near its high. The bulls will then see it as a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>On the day after a sell climax day, there is a 75% chance of a couple hours of sideways to up trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour. Because yesterday was a big bear day in an overbought market, if today is going to trend, down is slightly more likely.<p>However, day traders know that there will probably be early trading range trading. They will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom, and sell a double top or wedge rally. There will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-down-day-and-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-10.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down day and small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today so far is an inside day, and yesterday was an outside day. This is an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. Additionally, it is a 2nd attempt to resume up (yesterday was the 1st) and therefore a High 2 bull flag.<p>If today closes near its high, it would be a sign that the bull trend is likely to resume tomorrow. Today would be a reasonable buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The bears see last week’s rally as a buy climax. They want it to fail and for the EURUSD to reverse down to the November low. The reversal down so far is small, but it has 4 bear bars and there is not yet a strong buy setup. They hope to continue to prevent good buy signal bars and to have the pullback grow endlessly (Endless Pullback) into a Small Pullback Bear Trend.<p>Last week’s breakout was strong enough to make at least a small 2nd leg up likely. But it was extreme, and this could result in the pullback lasting a few more days. It might have to test the September 1 high (Breakout Test) before the bulls become aggressive again.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight from yesterday’s open. However, the rally is part of an Expanding Triangle, which is a type of trading range. Therefore, day traders have been selling as well as buying, and they have been looking for quick profits.<p>Today will probably be all about the close. Since today is a potential buy signal bar for tomorrow, the bulls want the day to close near its high. The bulls will continue to buy pullbacks to make that happen.<p>The bears will sell whenever today is near the high. They do not want today to close near the high because they know traders will then be more willing to buy tomorrow. It would increase the chance that the bull trend on the daily chart will resume.<p>What happens if today has a bull body on the daily chart, but it has a prominent tail on top? It would be less bullish, and the EURUSD would be less likely to resume up tomorrow. But it would increase the chance that the selloff is ending and that a small trading range beginning, and reduce the chance that tomorrow will be the start of another strong leg up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Small gaps usually close in the 1st hour. This one close on the 2nd bar. The bulls got a Final Bear Flag reversal, but the Emini then went sideways for the rest of the day.<p>Today is a High 1 buy signal bar for tomorrow. Tomorrow should trade above today’s high to trigger the buy signal. The bulls hope that the OO sell signal is a bear trap and that the bull trend is resuming. The bears hope that there will be sellers not too far above today’s high and then a 2nd leg down.<p>Tomorrow is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The open and low of the week are the most important prices. The bears want a bear body on the weekly chart. If the week closes on the low, it will be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. The bulls want the week to close at another all-time high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It might have to test the September 1 high (Breakout Test) before the bulls become aggressive again.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight from yesterday’s open. However, the rally is part of an Expanding Triangle, which is a type of trading range. Therefore, day traders have been selling as well as buying, and they have been looking for quick profits.<p>Today will probably be all about the close. Since today is a potential buy signal bar for tomorrow, the bulls want the day to close near its high. The bulls will continue to buy pullbacks to make that happen.<p>The bears will sell whenever today is near the high. They do not want today to close near the high because they know traders will then be more willing to buy tomorrow. It would increase the chance that the bull trend on the daily chart will resume.<p>What happens if today has a bull body on the daily chart, but it has a prominent tail on top? It would be less bullish, and the EURUSD would be less likely to resume up tomorrow. But it would increase the chance that the selloff is ending and that a small trading range beginning, and reduce the chance that tomorrow will be the start of another strong leg up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It was therefore an outside day. Yesterday reversed down from above Tuesday’s high and traded below Tuesday’s low. It was therefore an outside down day. Consecutive outside bars.<p>Consecutive outside days is an OO (outside-outside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. On a smaller time frame, it is an expanding triangle. Many traders will buy above the pattern and sell below. Therefore, yesterday is both a buy and sell signal bar.<p>It sometimes takes a few days for either signal to trigger. The day after a big outside day is often an inside day. That then creates an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is another Breakout Mode setup.<p>When an OO comes late in a bull trend, it is often the Final Bull Flag. Therefore, a bull breakout will probably not get very far before reversing down.<p>Since the Emini is overbought, there is a higher probability that the sell signal could lead to a selloff that could last a week or more. Remember, I have been saying that the Emini would rally in the 1st half of December and then probably reverse down in the 2nd half. This could be the start of that reversal.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Today is rollover day. That means March is now the front month. However, most day traders will continue to trade the December contract today because December will still have much more volume. They will switch to March tomorrow.<p>The bears want today to be a 2nd consecutive big bear day. But the Emini is down only 9 points in the Globex session. While it might gap down, which would trigger the OO sell signal on the daily chart, the gap would be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour and are usually insignificant.<p>The bears want a 2nd consecutive big bear day. However, that only happens 25% of the time on the day after a big sell climax day. If today is a bear day, it will probably be a weaker type of bear trend, like a Trending Trading Range Day or a Broad Bear Channel.<p>Can today reverse up from below yesterday’s low to above yesterday’s high? Today would then be a 3rd consecutive outside day. That is rare and therefore unlikely. However, the bulls would like today to close near its high. The bulls will then see it as a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>On the day after a sell climax day, there is a 75% chance of a couple hours of sideways to up trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour. Because yesterday was a big bear day in an overbought market, if today is going to trend, down is slightly more likely.<p>However, day traders know that there will probably be early trading range trading. They will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom, and sell a double top or wedge rally. There will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-down-day-and-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-10.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down day and small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today so far is an inside day, and yesterday was an outside day. This is an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. Additionally, it is a 2nd attempt to resume up (yesterday was the 1st) and therefore a High 2 bull flag.<p>If today closes near its high, it would be a sign that the bull trend is likely to resume tomorrow. Today would be a reasonable buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The bears see last week’s rally as a buy climax. They want it to fail and for the EURUSD to reverse down to the November low. The reversal down so far is small, but it has 4 bear bars and there is not yet a strong buy setup. They hope to continue to prevent good buy signal bars and to have the pullback grow endlessly (Endless Pullback) into a Small Pullback Bear Trend.<p>Last week’s breakout was strong enough to make at least a small 2nd leg up likely.

But yesterday reversed up and closed with a small bull body. It is a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today.<p>Traders are deciding if Wednesday is the start of a 2-week pullback, or if yesterday is a part of a pause in the bull trend. There is a 50% chance for either outcome. The OO sell signal is good for the bears and the 3-week tight bull channel is good for the bulls.<p>When there is confusion, there is an increased chance of a trading range. It reduces the chance that today will be a strong trend day up or down. With yesterday being mostly sideways, traders expect more trading range trading today.

The bulls want today to close above the week’s open. However, that is about 50 points above the current Globex price and unlikely. At a minimum, they would like the week to close far above the low of the week. That would reduce the chance of lower prices next week.<p>The bears are hoping that this is the start of a move down to below 3500. They would like the week to close on the low of the week.

The bulls see this small tight trading range as a bull flag. Yesterday was a big bull day. The bulls hope that it will be the start of a breakout of the bull flag. But the bull flag had 4 bear bars. That usually does not lead to a resumption of the bull trend without first going sideways for more bars.<p>Today traded about yesterday’s high, but sold off. So far, today is a big bear bar on the daily chart. That is bad follow-through and it increases the chance that the tight trading range will add more bars (days).<p>However, the day is not yet over. If the bulls can get it to close above the open, traders will expect higher prices next week.<p>The bears hope that today is forming a double top with last week’s high. They want a reversal down, at least to the September 1 high, which is the breakout point. They will have a better chance if today closes on its low.<p>It is important to remember that today is Friday. Last week was a big bull bar on the weekly chart, and a breakout to a 2-year high. This week is the follow-through bar. The more bullish it is, the greater the chance of higher prices next week. If the week closes on its low, it will be a sell signal bar for next week.<p>The overnight reversal down stopped right at the open of the week. The EURUSD has been trading in a 20-pip range around the open for 5 hours. Traders are clearly paying attention to the weekly chart today. This will likely continue all day.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from above yesterday’s high to the open of the week. It has been in a 25-pip range for 5 hours. Day traders are scalping reversals above and below the open.<p>This could continue all day. If it does, the week will close very near the open. It will have either a small bull or bear body. The bigger the bull body, the more hopeful the bulls will be for higher prices next week. The bigger the bear body, the more the bears will expect a reversal down next week.<p>If the week has even a small bear body, it will reduce the chance of higher prices next week. But if it ends up with a small bull or bear body, it will not offer much guidance for next week. It will increase the chance that the 7-day tight trading range on the daily chart will continue at least into early next week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-midday-wedge-bottom-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini midday wedge bottom and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday was a bull bar on the daily chart, which was a weak entry bar for the OO sell signal. Today was a 2nd consecutive bull bar. That increases the chance that the sell signal will fail. Today is a buy signal bar for Monday.<p>However, this week was a bear bar on the weekly chart. It is a sell signal bar for a wedge rally. But it had a prominent tail below, making it a weak sell signal bar.<p>Traders are deciding if a pullback to below 3500 has begun. There might be one more new high first. With a buy signal on the daily chart and a sell signal on the weekly chart, there is confusion. Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range, and it increases the chance that the Emini will continue in its 9-day tight trading range at least a little longer.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls see this small tight trading range as a bull flag. Yesterday was a big bull day. The bulls hope that it will be the start of a breakout of the bull flag. But the bull flag had 4 bear bars. That usually does not lead to a resumption of the bull trend without first going sideways for more bars.<p>Today traded about yesterday’s high, but sold off. So far, today is a big bear bar on the daily chart. That is bad follow-through and it increases the chance that the tight trading range will add more bars (days).<p>However, the day is not yet over. If the bulls can get it to close above the open, traders will expect higher prices next week.<p>The bears hope that today is forming a double top with last week’s high. They want a reversal down, at least to the September 1 high, which is the breakout point. They will have a better chance if today closes on its low.<p>It is important to remember that today is Friday. Last week was a big bull bar on the weekly chart, and a breakout to a 2-year high. This week is the follow-through bar. The more bullish it is, the greater the chance of higher prices next week. If the week closes on its low, it will be a sell signal bar for next week.<p>The overnight reversal down stopped right at the open of the week. The EURUSD has been trading in a 20-pip range around the open for 5 hours. Traders are clearly paying attention to the weekly chart today. This will likely continue all day.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from above yesterday’s high to the open of the week. It has been in a 25-pip range for 5 hours. Day traders are scalping reversals above and below the open.<p>This could continue all day. If it does, the week will close very near the open. It will have either a small bull or bear body. The bigger the bull body, the more hopeful the bulls will be for higher prices next week. The bigger the bear body, the more the bears will expect a reversal down next week.<p>If the week has even a small bear body, it will reduce the chance of higher prices next week. But if it ends up with a small bull or bear body, it will not offer much guidance for next week. It will increase the chance that the 7-day tight trading range on the daily chart will continue at least into early next week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-midday-wedge-bottom-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini midday wedge bottom and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But yesterday reversed up and closed with a small bull body. It is a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today.<p>Traders are deciding if Wednesday is the start of a 2-week pullback, or if yesterday is a part of a pause in the bull trend. There is a 50% chance for either outcome. The OO sell signal is good for the bears and the 3-week tight bull channel is good for the bulls.<p>When there is confusion, there is an increased chance of a trading range. It reduces the chance that today will be a strong trend day up or down. With yesterday being mostly sideways, traders expect more trading range trading today. However, the daily ranges are big enough for at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want another weekly close at a new all-time high. The bears, however, want a close below the open of the week so that this week would have a bear body. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week, especially if the week closes on its low.<p>Day traders should switch to trading the March Emini contract today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 25 points in the Globex session. It might gap down below yesterday’s low. If so, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the first hour.<p>Because of the sell signal triggering yesterday on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of a bear trend day today. However, with yesterday being a trading range day on the 5-minute chart and having a small bull body on the daily chart, there is uncertainty. Yesterday was a bad entry bar for the bears. This increases the chance of more sideways trading today.<p>Even if today is another sideways for most of the day, there is an increased chance of a strong trend up or down in the final hour. The bulls want today to close above the week’s open. However, that is about 50 points above the current Globex price and unlikely. At a minimum, they would like the week to close far above the low of the week. That would reduce the chance of lower prices next week.<p>The bears are hoping that this is the start of a move down to below 3500. They would like the week to close on the low of the week. This week would then be a strong sell signal bar on the weekly chart, and it would increase the chance that the selloff has begun.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-11.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then trading range.

might be forming a wedge top on the daily and weekly charts at yearend. But there might be one more new high before there is a reversal down.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>have been in a tight trading range for 7 weeks, and they are at the apex of a 9-month triangle. They bounced this week. They can continue sideways indefinitely before they break out. Once they do breakout, down is more likely.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market had slight follow-through buying this week after last week’s strong breakout. The rally should reach the February 2018 high above 1.25, but there is a possible wedge on the weekly chart. That could lead to a pullback to the November low before the rally reaches the 1.25 target.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-on-weekly-chart-are-bouncing-at-bottom-of-a-9-month-triangle\">Bond futures on<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart are bouncing at bottom of a 9-month triangle</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-reversing-up-from-bottom-of-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-12.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart reversing up from bottom of triangle\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures have been in a triangle for 9 months. This week reversed up from a micro double bottom with the low of 4 weeks ago. The reversal is just above the June low, which is the bottom of the triangle.<p>A triangle (and any other type of trading range) is a Breakout Mode pattern. Since the bonds have been trading down from the August high, the odds slightly favor a bear breakout. But that is the nature of Breakout Mode patterns. They always look like they are about to break out, but most of the breakout attempts reverse.<p>Last week was a big bear bar, but this week’s reversal up erased much of that bearishness. Next week is important. If it is a 2nd bull bar, and if the bar is big and closes on its high, traders will conclude that the rally will probably have a couple legs up and test the bear trend line.<p>If next week collapses to below the June low, traders will look for a test of the March low. But next week will probably not collapse. If next week is a bear bar, it will probably be small.<p>If next week stays within this week’s range, there would be consecutive inside bars. An ii (inside-inside) pattern is a Breakout Mode pattern. That does not alter the probability of the direction of the breakout.<p>Since the weekly bond market is also at the apex of a triangle, traders already know that it is in Breakout Mode. Traders assume that the probability of a bear breakout is about the same as for a bull breakout. Furthermore, they believe that the 1st breakout up or down will fail.<h3 id=\"3-bonds-are-neutral-going-into-next-week\">Bonds are neutral going into next week</h3><p>What about next week? The bond market has been in a tight trading range for 7 weeks. Every week has reversed the week before, or provided no follow-through. Traders will expect the same next week. That means a small bear or bull bar is more likely than a big trend bar up or down.<p>As I said, the weekly chart has formed a triangle and the bond market is at the apex. That increases the chance of a breakout attempt within a few weeks. But since most breakouts fail, the breakout is more likely to reverse than lead to a trend. Until there are consecutive strong closes above or below the triangle, traders will continue to bet on reversals instead of trends.<p>One final point. I keep saying that bonds will be lower in 5 years. That means higher interest rates, and it means that they will break below the 9-month trading range. But I also keep saying that bonds could drift back up to the top of the trading range, or even to a new high while everyone waits for the bear breakout.<h2 id=\"4-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-on-weekly-chart-has-weak-follow-through-after-last-weeks-strong-bull-breakout\">EURUSD on<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart has weak follow-through after last week’s strong bull breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-bear-doji-so-weak-signal-bar-after-last-weeks-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-12-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has bear doji so weak signal bar after last week's breakout\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart formed an inside bar this week. Last week was a big bull bar that broke above a 4-month trading range. This week was the follow-through bar.<p>A follow-through bar often gives traders an idea of what to expect over the next several bars (weeks). This week was an inside bar with a small body. It is therefore neutral. Traders then look back for the last time things were clear. That obviously was last week’s big bull bar. Neutral after bullish usually means a pause. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg up. However, the chart could remain neutral (go sideways) for several more bars (weeks) before resuming up.<p>If this week was a big bear bar closing on its low, traders would have concluded that the breakout failed. They then would be looking for a reversal down next week.<h3 id=\"6-1st-reversal-down-will-probably-be-minor\">1st reversal down will probably be minor</h3><p>The bears can still get their reversal down, even with this week being neutral. For example, if next week is a 2nd consecutive inside bar (an ii pattern, which is inside-inside) and it closes on its low, many traders will sell below that bear bar. A breakout or a buy climax sometimes reverses from an ii pattern. But without that or a big Bear Surprise Bar next week, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices for a week or more.<p>Can the rally continue straight up to the February 2018 major lower high without a pullback? That is unlikely. The rally is in its 3rd leg up from the March low, and it is climactic. Traders expect a pullback, which means a minor reversal. The trend should continue up to the February 2018 high of 1.2555, some time next year.<p>If the rally begins to pull back within the next few weeks from around the top of the wedge channel (currently above 1.23), traders will look for a couple legs down. The September to November trading range might be the Final Bull Flag. If there is a reversal down, it will probably fall to the middle or bottom of that range.<h2 id=\"7-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"8-monthly-emini-chart-has-weak-follow-through-after-novembers-strong-bull-breakout\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has weak follow-through after November’s strong bull breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-stock-index-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-doji-follow-through-bar-after-big-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 stock index futures monthly candlestick chart has doji follow-through bar after big breakout\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a big bull bar in November and it closed far above the October high. It is a breakout bar, but is it coming late in a bull trend, which began a decade ago.<p>A breakout late in a bull trend usually attracts profit taking. There is often a pause and a brief 2nd leg up (a bar or two) before the profit taking begins. The reversal down should have at least a couple legs and last 5 – 10 bars. Since this is a monthly chart, traders should expect a trading range to begin early next year, and last at least into the summer.<h3 id=\"9-so-far-no-follow-through-buying-in-december\">So far, no follow-through buying in December</h3><p>This month so far is a small bear doji bar. That is not what the bulls want to see after a big breakout. They were hoping for a 2nd consecutive big bull bar closing on its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices in January. There is still plenty of time remaining in December for that to happen, but it has not happened yet. If December closes near its low, it will be a sell signal bar for January.<p>The lack of follow-through buying increases the chance that November was an exhaustive buy climax. If it was, disappointed bulls will start to exit, which would result in at least a minor reversal.<p>I have been saying that the October bear bar was a bad High 1 buy signal bar. I said that the breakout above a bad bull flag usually goes up for a couple bars (months), and then there is a bigger pullback. There was a 2-month pullback in September and October. If November was an exhaustive move, it will probably lead to at least a couple legs sideways to down. That should take at least 5 bars (months), which mean about the 1st half of 2021.<h3 id=\"10-will-the-emini-reach-jp-morgans-target-of-4500-in-2021\">Will the Emini reach JP Morgan’s target of 4,500 in 2021?</h3><p>What about all of the bulls on TV who are saying that the Emini will reach 4,000 to 4,500? JP Morgan’s prediction is 4,500. They are basing their projection on fundamentals, which contain many assumptions. If the Fed continues to be supportive and there are no Black Swans (unexpected disasters), they might be right. However, the charts do not look like this will happen.<p>I will post a yearly chart at the end of the year (a chart where every bar is one year). This year is a huge outside up bar and it is coming late in a bull trend. A big outside up bar early in a bull trend is very bullish. When it comes late in the trend, if more often is an exhaustive buy climax.<p>A buy climax does not mean the start of a bear trend. But it does mean a pause in a bull trend. Traders look for the market to go sideways to down for at least a couple legs and 10 or more bars. At that point, it can resume up or reverse down.<p>I am talking about the yearly chart. Ten or more bars means a trading range lasting 10 years. That is what is likely. It might have begun in 2018.<p>A 10-year trading range after a strong rally on the yearly chart is common. Just look back at the 1970’s and the 2000’s. The market was sideways for about 10 years, and it sold off between 40 and 70% several times. Welcome to the 2020’s!<h3 id=\"11-the-yearly-chart-has-always-been-in-a-bull-trend\">The yearly chart has always been in a bull trend</h3><p>Since the stock market has always been in a bull trend on the yearly chart, even if it were to go sideways for 10 bars, it would be a bull flag. As long as the world’s population is increasing and the productivity is increasing, the world’s wealth will increase. That means that the stock market will go higher.<p>This will not last forever. There will never be 100 trillion people in the world. Once the world’s population peaks, the stock market will be much more sideways for centuries, and much less up.<p>That is not going to happen in our lifetime. The market will continue higher. With 70% of the years being up, it makes sense for the institutions to always be bullish about the coming year.<h2 id=\"12-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-wedge-top-sell-signal-but-weak-sell-signal-bar\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has wedge top sell signal, but weak sell signal bar</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-stock-index-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-sell-signal-bar-at-measured-move-and-top-of-wedge.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-12-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 stock index futures weekly chart wedge top weak sell signal bar at measured move\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a bad bull flag 3 weeks ago. There were consecutive bear bars and they came late in a bull trend. I said that there might be a rally for a couple bars (weeks), but then traders should expect more of a pullback. This 2-bar bad bull flag is similar to the one on the monthly chart. Both increase the chance of a trading range developing soon.<p>This week was a bear bar, and it is therefore a sell signal bar for next week. There have been 3 legs up from the September 24 low. Consequently, this rally is a wedge bull channel.<p>A wedge top is also a possible higher high major trend reversal. Will it lead to a bear trend? Only 40% of major trend reversals actually lead to a major trend reversal, which means a bull trend reversing into a bear trend.<p>If there is a series of big bear bars over the next few weeks, then traders will conclude that a major reversal is underway. But more often, the reversal will turn out to be minor. That means a trading range or a bull flag. Once in a trading range, the bulls will try to create trend resumption up, while the bears will look for a trend reversal down.<h2 id=\"13-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-reversing-down-from-an-oo-and-wedge-top\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversing down from an OO and wedge top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-stock-index-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-oo-sell-signal-and-nested-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-12-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 stock index futures daily candlestick chart has oo sell signal and nested wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a tight trading range for 9 days after breaking above the November 9 high. The rally from the November 10 low is a Small Pullback Bull trend, which is a tight bull channel. A bull channel usually has a bear breakout. It then typically evolves into a trading range.<p>It is important to note that Tuesday traded below Monday’s low and then above Monday’s high. It was therefore an outside up day. But Wednesday was outside down. There were consecutive outside bars. This is an OO pattern (Outside-Outside), and there is usually also an expanding triangle on a smaller time frame.<p>An OO is a Breakout Mode pattern. When Thursday traded below the OO, it triggered a daily sell signal. There is also a micro wedge top.<p>Thursday had a bull body, which means it was a weak entry bar. Friday was a bull bar closing near its high. It is therefore a buy signal bar.<p>The bulls hope that the bull trend is resuming. The bears want a lower high and a 2nd leg down. But even if the bulls get a new high, the 3 week rally is probably a bull leg in a trading range. Traders should expect a reversal down. It will probably come this month, but it might not begin until January. This week’s reversal down could be the start, but the bears need more and bigger bear bars next week. Otherwise traders will expect a new high.<h3 id=\"14-a-reversal-from-a-buy-climax-usually-has-a-couple-legs-and-lasts-about-10-bars\">A reversal from a buy climax usually has a couple legs and lasts about 10 bars</h3><p>When a bull channel has 3 legs up and then reverses down, the channel is a wedge top. This is true even if the channel is not contracting. My rule of thumb for what to expect is TBTL… Ten Bars, Two Legs. The pullback can be sideways or down, and it can last much longer than 10 bars. Sometimes it can be as brief as 5 bars.<p>After a couple legs down, the bulls will assess the strength of the bears. If the reversal down looks like a bear trend, the bulls will wait for the selling to dry up before buying. But if the selling is weak, the bulls will buy again. They want to see the bears make a couple attempts to create a bear trend and fail both times.<p>That is why I say that the reversal from a buy climax usually has at least a couple legs. This usually takes about ten bars. Sometimes the bears make a 3rd attempt. If it fails, the selloff is a wedge bull flag. Once the bulls are confident that the bears will give up, the bulls buy, looking for a resumption of the bull trend.<h3 id=\"15-pullback-likely-to-begin-within-a-few-weeks\">Pullback likely to begin within a few weeks</h3><p>So what about now? The bears have not yet done enough to convince traders that the reversal down is underway. There might be one more brief new high before the reversal begins. The reversal could come as late as early January.<p>The rally from the October low has lacked streaks of consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. In fact, most days have closed in the middle or near the open. When a rally looks like that, it is usually a bull leg in a trading range and not the start of a bull trend. Also, the High 1 bull flags on the weekly and monthly chart are weak.<p>These factors make a pullback likely soon. The minimum target for the bears would be the middle of the 3 month trading range. That means below 3500.<h2 id=\"16-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But both Thursday and Friday were bull days. That increases the chance that the sell signal will fail. Friday is a buy signal bar for today.<p>However, last week is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart for this week. When there are conflicting signals, there is confusion. That usually results in sideways trading. The Emini already has been in a tight trading range for 9 days. That will probably continue for at least another day or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. Today will probably gap above Friday’s high. That would trigger a High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. However, the bears see the chart as still on its OO sell signal, as long as the Emini stays below the top of the OO, which is the December 9 high.<p>As I said, when there is confusion, the market usually goes sideways. It has already been going sideways for 9 days. Sideways on the daily chart increases the chance of trading range trading on the 5-minute chart. But the daily ranges have been big enough for swing trades up and down.<p>Can today be a big bull or bear trend day? Of course, but with most days for 2 months having at least one reversal, day traders will expect at least on reversal again today.<p>Finally, when the Emini is near its all-time high, there is an increased chance of a new all-time high. There have been many new all-time highs since August. The current all-time high is only about 20 points above the Globex high. Therefore, there might be another all-time high today. The reason why this one would be a little more important, is that it would end the OO sell signal and trigger an OO buy signal. The would increase the chance of higher prices.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-midday-wedge-bottom-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-14.png\" alt=\"Emini midday wedge bottom and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-weak-breakout-above-bull-flag-might-lead-to-nested-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-14-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weak breakout above bull flag might lead to nested wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied for 2 months. It is breaking above a weak bull flag. The bulls want the rally to continue up to the February 2018 high with only brief pullbacks. However, the daily and weekly charts are more consistent with a bigger pullback before the rally reaches its target.<p>If the EURUSD reverses down from here, there will be a double top. The reversal would probably be minor, and just add more bars to the 2-week tight trading range. There would then likely be at least one more brief leg up.<p>But if the rally resumes for several days to at least 50 pips above the December 4 high, and then reverses, there would be a wedge top. Since there would also be a bigger wedge top on the weekly chart, there would be a nested wedge top. That is a reliable reversal pattern. Traders would expect a couple legs down on the weekly chart. The result could be a couple months of pulling back to support at around the November 4 low.<p>Traders expect higher prices soon, but they will look for a reversal for a couple months before the rally reaches the February 2018 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied overnight in a tight bull channel. Day traders so far have only been buying.<p>However, a bull channel usually has a bear breakout. The chart will then transition into a trading range. Once there is a 20-pip pullback, or a trading range lasting a couple hours, day traders will also start to sell reversals down for scalps.<p>Can today reverse back down to the low of the day? It could, but a reversal will more likely stop at around 1.2140, which was the high on the open, and the start of the channel that began in the European session.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It continued down in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. The low of the day was just 2 ticks above the November 9 high.<p>The bears want a continuation down from a double top with last week’s high. Today is a sell signal bar on the daily chart. IF the bears get 2 or 3 consecutive bear days, traders will conclude that the reversal down to at least 3500 is underway. But today was the 10th day in a tight trading range and that increases the chance of more sideways trading tomorrow.<p>On the 5-minute chart, today was a bear channel. Since most bear channels break above the bull trend line, traders expect a bull breakout tomorrow. However, they usually evolve into a trading range instead of reversing into a bull trend. Also, after a sell climax day, the Emini usually will have at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. That reduces the chance of another big bear day tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But both Thursday and Friday were bull days. That increases the chance that the sell signal will fail. Friday is a buy signal bar for today.<p>However, last week is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart for this week. When there are conflicting signals, there is confusion. That usually results in sideways trading. The Emini already has been in a tight trading range for 9 days. That will probably continue for at least another day or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. Today will probably gap above Friday’s high. That would trigger a High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. However, the bears see the chart as still on its OO sell signal, as long as the Emini stays below the top of the OO, which is the December 9 high.<p>As I said, when there is confusion, the market usually goes sideways. It has already been going sideways for 9 days. Sideways on the daily chart increases the chance of trading range trading on the 5-minute chart. But the daily ranges have been big enough for swing trades up and down.<p>Can today be a big bull or bear trend day? Of course, but with most days for 2 months having at least one reversal, day traders will expect at least on reversal again today.<p>Finally, when the Emini is near its all-time high, there is an increased chance of a new all-time high. There have been many new all-time highs since August. The current all-time high is only about 20 points above the Globex high. Therefore, there might be another all-time high today. The reason why this one would be a little more important, is that it would end the OO sell signal and trigger an OO buy signal. The would increase the chance of higher prices.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-midday-wedge-bottom-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-14.png\" alt=\"Emini midday wedge bottom and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-weak-breakout-above-bull-flag-might-lead-to-nested-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-14-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weak breakout above bull flag might lead to nested wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied for 2 months. It is breaking above a weak bull flag. The bulls want the rally to continue up to the February 2018 high with only brief pullbacks. However, the daily and weekly charts are more consistent with a bigger pullback before the rally reaches its target.<p>If the EURUSD reverses down from here, there will be a double top. The reversal would probably be minor, and just add more bars to the 2-week tight trading range. There would then likely be at least one more brief leg up.<p>But if the rally resumes for several days to at least 50 pips above the December 4 high, and then reverses, there would be a wedge top. Since there would also be a bigger wedge top on the weekly chart, there would be a nested wedge top. That is a reliable reversal pattern. Traders would expect a couple legs down on the weekly chart. The result could be a couple months of pulling back to support at around the November 4 low.<p>Traders expect higher prices soon, but they will look for a reversal for a couple months before the rally reaches the February 2018 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied overnight in a tight bull channel. Day traders so far have only been buying.<p>However, a bull channel usually has a bear breakout. The chart will then transition into a trading range. Once there is a 20-pip pullback, or a trading range lasting a couple hours, day traders will also start to sell reversals down for scalps.<p>Can today reverse back down to the low of the day? It could, but a reversal will more likely stop at around 1.2140, which was the high on the open, and the start of the channel that began in the European session.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Therefore, day traders will expect at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading today, to begin by the end of the 2nd hour. Traders should think of every bear channel as a bull flag, because there is typically a break above the bear trend line. That will probably happen today.<p>Yesterday was a bear day on the daily chart. The bears are hoping that last week’s OO sell signal was the start of a 50% retracement of the November rally. If they get 2 or 3 consecutive bear days, traders will conclude that the selloff to below 3500 has begun. But with the Emini sideways for 10 days, it is more likely to continue sideways at least a little longer. A possible yearend tight trading range around the open of the month.<p>Picking the start of a trend when the market is sideways is a low probability bet. Markets have inertia. There is a strong tendency to continue what they have been doing. The Emini has been going sideways for a couple weeks, and reversing every 2 or 3 days. Traders will continue to take quick profits until there is a clear trend.<p>Remember, last week was a bear bar on the weekly chart. It is a sell signal bar for a wedge top. The bears want this week to fall below last week’s low, to trigger the sell signal. Last week’s low is therefore a magnet below.<p>The month so far is a small doji bar on the monthly chart. It is bad follow-through after November’s big rally. The close of this month is important. A bear body increases the chance of lower prices in January while a bull body increases the chance of higher prices. Whether or not January is up, the Emini will probably be sideways for the 1st half of next year, like I discussed over the weekend.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 26 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open above yesterday’s bear trend line, and in the middle of yesterday’s range. It is also in the middle of a 2-week trading range.<p>While yesterday was a bear trend day on the 5-minute chart, most days for 6 weeks have had at least one reversal. Day traders will expect that again today.<p>Can today be a big bull trend day? That is unlikely after yesterday spent all day in a tight bear channel.<p>What about a 2nd big bear day? That happens only 25% of the time on the day after a Small Pullback Bear Trend. With the Emini is a 2-week trading range, it is even less likely.<p>Therefore, today will probably be a trading range day or a weak trend day up or down. A common example of a weak trend is a trending trading day where the Emini enters an early trading range for 1 to 3 hours, has a brief breakout up or down, and then enters another trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-15.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders are deciding when it should begin a 2- to 3-week pullback from the strong rally. The bulls want at least one more leg up. However, a strong reversal down this week will be from a double top. The bears would look for a test of the bottom of the most recent leg up, which is the December 1 low.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is no strong sell signal bar, and the trading range is in a bull trend. Both of these factors make a bull breakout more likely. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. The chart could not be going sideways if the bulls had a big advantage. That is why this is a Breakout Mode pattern. The probability is close to 50-50, and only slightly better for the bulls.<p>Traders are waiting for a breakout in either direction. If the trading range starts to form 3 or more bull bars closing near their highs, the odds of a bull breakout will go up. If instead there are several consecutive strong bear bars, traders will begin to short, expecting a bear breakout.<p>In the meantime, they are buying intraday selloffs and selling intraday rallies and taking quick profits. The result is a continuation of the trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has had several reversals overnight. Day traders are scalping up and down.<p>A breakout up or down on the daily chart can come at any time. However, day traders know that reversals are more likely, and they therefore will continue to bet against intraday breakouts.<p>If there is a series of strong trend bars on the 5-minute in either direction, they will hold of a small swing. But until there is a clear breakout of the 2-week trading range, day traders will be hesitant to hold onto a trade all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

After drifting down, it reversed up from from a failed breakout below a wedge bull flag. The rally was a Small Pullback Bull Trend, and it contained a 17-bar bull micro channel. Every low for 17 bars was at or above the low of the prior bar.<p>While this is a sign of relentless buying, it also attracts profit takers. The 15th bar in the micro channel was big, and it was an exhaustive buy climax. The Emini went sideways for the remainder of the day.<p>Today was a bull inside day on the daily chart. It is therefore a High 1 buy signal bar for tomorrow. The bulls want the year to close at a new all-time high. However, the Emini is near the top of a 3-week trading range, and the Emini has been reversing every few days. That reduces the chance of a big bull trend day tomorrow.<p>The FOMC announcement comes out tomorrow at 11 am PST. Day traders should be flat ahead of the announcement.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Therefore, day traders will expect at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading today, to begin by the end of the 2nd hour. Traders should think of every bear channel as a bull flag, because there is typically a break above the bear trend line. That will probably happen today.<p>Yesterday was a bear day on the daily chart. The bears are hoping that last week’s OO sell signal was the start of a 50% retracement of the November rally. If they get 2 or 3 consecutive bear days, traders will conclude that the selloff to below 3500 has begun. But with the Emini sideways for 10 days, it is more likely to continue sideways at least a little longer. A possible yearend tight trading range around the open of the month.<p>Picking the start of a trend when the market is sideways is a low probability bet. Markets have inertia. There is a strong tendency to continue what they have been doing. The Emini has been going sideways for a couple weeks, and reversing every 2 or 3 days. Traders will continue to take quick profits until there is a clear trend.<p>Remember, last week was a bear bar on the weekly chart. It is a sell signal bar for a wedge top. The bears want this week to fall below last week’s low, to trigger the sell signal. Last week’s low is therefore a magnet below.<p>The month so far is a small doji bar on the monthly chart. It is bad follow-through after November’s big rally. The close of this month is important. A bear body increases the chance of lower prices in January while a bull body increases the chance of higher prices. Whether or not January is up, the Emini will probably be sideways for the 1st half of next year, like I discussed over the weekend.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 26 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open above yesterday’s bear trend line, and in the middle of yesterday’s range. It is also in the middle of a 2-week trading range.<p>While yesterday was a bear trend day on the 5-minute chart, most days for 6 weeks have had at least one reversal. Day traders will expect that again today.<p>Can today be a big bull trend day? That is unlikely after yesterday spent all day in a tight bear channel.<p>What about a 2nd big bear day? That happens only 25% of the time on the day after a Small Pullback Bear Trend. With the Emini is a 2-week trading range, it is even less likely.<p>Therefore, today will probably be a trading range day or a weak trend day up or down. A common example of a weak trend is a trending trading day where the Emini enters an early trading range for 1 to 3 hours, has a brief breakout up or down, and then enters another trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-15.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders are deciding when it should begin a 2- to 3-week pullback from the strong rally. The bulls want at least one more leg up. However, a strong reversal down this week will be from a double top. The bears would look for a test of the bottom of the most recent leg up, which is the December 1 low.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is no strong sell signal bar, and the trading range is in a bull trend. Both of these factors make a bull breakout more likely. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. The chart could not be going sideways if the bulls had a big advantage. That is why this is a Breakout Mode pattern. The probability is close to 50-50, and only slightly better for the bulls.<p>Traders are waiting for a breakout in either direction. If the trading range starts to form 3 or more bull bars closing near their highs, the odds of a bull breakout will go up. If instead there are several consecutive strong bear bars, traders will begin to short, expecting a bear breakout.<p>In the meantime, they are buying intraday selloffs and selling intraday rallies and taking quick profits. The result is a continuation of the trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has had several reversals overnight. Day traders are scalping up and down.<p>A breakout up or down on the daily chart can come at any time. However, day traders know that reversals are more likely, and they therefore will continue to bet against intraday breakouts.<p>If there is a series of strong trend bars on the 5-minute in either direction, they will hold of a small swing. But until there is a clear breakout of the 2-week trading range, day traders will be hesitant to hold onto a trade all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Tuesday was therefore an Emini inside bar, an inside day.<p>Since the Emini closed near its high, it is a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart. Traders see Tuesday as a sharp pullback from Tuesday’s big gap up. The bulls are hoping that Monday was the start of a leg up to a new high. They want the year to close at a new all-time high.<p>However, the Emini is now in its third sideways week. Traders have been looking for reversals every few days. That reduces the chance of a big bull trend day today. Also, the day after a Small Pullback Bull Trend Day typically has at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>While the odds favor another new high this month, December so far is a small bar on the monthly chart. Therefore, the year might close around the open of the month, even if there is one more new high first. December would be a weak follow-through bar on the monthly chart after November’s big bull breakout. It would increase the chance of at least a minor reversal in January.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 7 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap above yesterday’s high, which would trigger the High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. However, a small gap typically closes in the first hour and is insignificant.<p>The all-time high is only about 5 points above the Globex high. The bulls therefore have about a 50% chance of another new high today. They would like a 2nd consecutive big bull day. However, yesterday was a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That typically results in exhaustion. Traders expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading to begin before the end of the 2nd hour. Also, the Emini is at the top of a 3-week trading range. That reduces the chance of a big bull day today.<p>There is an FOMC announcement at 11 am PST today. Day traders should exit positions before the report and wait at least 10 minutes afterwards before resuming trading. There is usually a sharp move up and down within the 1st few minutes, and it typically takes about 10 minutes to know which will lead to a swing. Also, traders should be open to anything after the announcement. That means a bull trend, a bear trend, a reversal, or a trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-16.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend.

The bulls want the rally to continue up to the February 2018 major lower high above 1.25, without more than a 2-week pullback.<p>However, that is unlikely. This is a 3rd leg up on both the daily and weekly charts. A reversal would be from a wedge top, and it would probably lead to a pullback that lasts at least a few weeks.<p>Also, most of the bars for 3 weeks have overlapped one another and have prominent tails on top. This is not how a chart typically looks if it is going a lot higher from here. It is trading range price action, and increases the chance of a bear leg developing soon.<p>But the EURUSD has been trending up since March, and therefore traders will continue to look for at least slightly higher prices, until there is a strong sell signal bar, or a big reversal down. There is at least a 50% chance that this rally will begin to pull back to below 1.20 by early January.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke strongly above the December 4 high overnight, but it drifted back down to that high over the past several hours. The bulls want today to close far above that breakout point, and on the high of the day. That would increase the chance of a measured move up, based on the height of the 10-day trading range.<p>The bears always want the opposite. They want the reversal down to continue to a new low. If today is a big bear day on the daily chart, it would be a credible sell signal bar for a wedge top reversal.<p>What is most likely after a relatively big breakout and a reversal down? Confusion, and that usually results in a trading range. The most likely outcome after the 30-pip selloff is that the EURUSD goes sideways. Then, at the end of the day, the EURUSD will probably close a little above or below the December 4 high.<p>There is an FOMC announcement at 11 am PST today. That can affect all financial markets. It is better for day traders to exit positions ahead of the report and wait at least 10 minutes before resuming trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-FOMC-trading-range-day-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC trading range day at all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It then reversed down from a wedge rally a couple hours later.<p>Today was an FOMC day. The Emini sold off on the report but then reversed up to anew all-time high. It sold off again to the middle of the day’s range, like most days over the past 6 weeks.<p>Since it has been rallying for 7 weeks, it will probably go a little higher. But, probably not much higher. It should pull back in January for at least a couple weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There is at least a 50% chance that this rally will begin to pull back to below 1.20 by early January.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke strongly above the December 4 high overnight, but it drifted back down to that high over the past several hours. The bulls want today to close far above that breakout point, and on the high of the day. That would increase the chance of a measured move up, based on the height of the 10-day trading range.<p>The bears always want the opposite. They want the reversal down to continue to a new low. If today is a big bear day on the daily chart, it would be a credible sell signal bar for a wedge top reversal.<p>What is most likely after a relatively big breakout and a reversal down? Confusion, and that usually results in a trading range. The most likely outcome after the 30-pip selloff is that the EURUSD goes sideways. Then, at the end of the day, the EURUSD will probably close a little above or below the December 4 high.<p>There is an FOMC announcement at 11 am PST today. That can affect all financial markets. It is better for day traders to exit positions ahead of the report and wait at least 10 minutes before resuming trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-FOMC-trading-range-day-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC trading range day at all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Tuesday was therefore an Emini inside bar, an inside day.<p>Since the Emini closed near its high, it is a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart. Traders see Tuesday as a sharp pullback from Tuesday’s big gap up. The bulls are hoping that Monday was the start of a leg up to a new high. They want the year to close at a new all-time high.<p>However, the Emini is now in its third sideways week. Traders have been looking for reversals every few days. That reduces the chance of a big bull trend day today. Also, the day after a Small Pullback Bull Trend Day typically has at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>While the odds favor another new high this month, December so far is a small bar on the monthly chart. Therefore, the year might close around the open of the month, even if there is one more new high first. December would be a weak follow-through bar on the monthly chart after November’s big bull breakout. It would increase the chance of at least a minor reversal in January.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 7 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap above yesterday’s high, which would trigger the High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. However, a small gap typically closes in the first hour and is insignificant.<p>The all-time high is only about 5 points above the Globex high. The bulls therefore have about a 50% chance of another new high today. They would like a 2nd consecutive big bull day. However, yesterday was a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That typically results in exhaustion. Traders expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading to begin before the end of the 2nd hour. Also, the Emini is at the top of a 3-week trading range. That reduces the chance of a big bull day today.<p>There is an FOMC announcement at 11 am PST today. Day traders should exit positions before the report and wait at least 10 minutes afterwards before resuming trading. There is usually a sharp move up and down within the 1st few minutes, and it typically takes about 10 minutes to know which will lead to a swing. Also, traders should be open to anything after the announcement. That means a bull trend, a bear trend, a reversal, or a trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-16.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend.

The bulls want the rally to continue up to the February 2018 major lower high above 1.25, without more than a 2-week pullback.<p>However, that is unlikely. This is a 3rd leg up on both the daily and weekly charts. A reversal would be from a wedge top, and it would probably lead to a pullback that lasts at least a few weeks.<p>Also, most of the bars for 3 weeks have overlapped one another and have prominent tails on top. This is not how a chart typically looks if it is going a lot higher from here.

The yearend Small Pullback Bull Trend bull channel that began on November 10 could continue up for a few more weeks, but the Emini will probably pull back for at least a couple weeks soon. This should begin in late December or early January.<p>The Emini has also been in a tight trading range for 3 weeks. Even though yesterday made another new high, it did not break far above the top of the range. Consequently, the Emini might still be in the range instead of beginning a new leg up. But if the bulls get consecutive big bull bars closing far above the 3-week range, traders will conclude that the rally will probably continue up for at least a measured move, based on the 3-week range.<p>If the Emini reverses down this week, there will be a wedge top. The tops of 1st 2 legs up were on November 16 and December 9. Traders would expect the reversal to test the start of the wedge, which was the November 10 low, just below 3500.<p>With most days for 2 months having at least one swing up and one swing down, traders will expect that again today. Furthermore, most days have closed either in the middle of the day’s range or near the open. Those 2 prices could be magnets again today in the final hour.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 17 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up to a new all-time high. The bulls want the rally to accelerate up for a measured move that is based on the 100-point height of the 3 week trading range. If they get a couple consecutive bars closing on their highs on the daily chart, traders will expect the rally to continue up. It would increase the chance of several bull trend days over the next week.<p>Whenever there is a breakout, there is usually about a 50% chance it will fail. The market often goes sideways for a few days, as traders decide if the breakout will continue up or reverse down. There is a slightly increased chance that the Emini could trend up or down strongly. However, with the daily chart overbought and the Emini gapping above a trading range, the Emini will probably be sideways for a day or two as traders decide if the breakout will succeed or fail.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-FOMC-trading-range-day-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-17.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC trading range day at all time high in yearend small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

They want the rally to continue up to the February 2018 major lower high above 1.25, without more than a 3-day pullback.<p>However, this is the 3rd leg up, and the 3 legs are forming a 3rd leg up on the weekly chart. If there is a reversal down within the next few weeks, there would be a nested wedge top. Traders would look for the selloff to last at least a couple weeks.<p>There is no sign of a top and traders expect higher prices. But the EURUSD is now at a couple of measured move targets. This could attract some profit taking.<p>While the location and possible wedge top are good for the bears, the rally is strong. Most traders will not sell until there is at least a micro double top. That means they expect the EURUSD to be sideways to up for at least a couple more days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying in a Small Pullback Bull Trend overnight. Day traders have only been buying for both scalps and swing trades. They will not sell until there is at least a 20-pip pullback. And even then, most will continue to only look to buy until there is a trading range, that lasts at least a couple hours.<p>Most strong trends enter a trading range. Traders expect a trading range today. However, if the height of the range is only 20 pips, day traders will prefer to only buy. Once the rally evolves into a trading range, day traders will switch to scalping.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-doji-day-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini doji day and trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It then went sideways in a trading range day today. It closed one tick above the open for an almost perfect doji day. Most days for 7 weeks have closed near the open or near the middle of the day. Those are neutral days, and they increase the chance of a two to three week selloff starting soon.<p>Because this week’s rally is the 3rd leg up in the bull channel that began in early November, the next reversal down would be from a wedge top. That would increase the chance that it would be deeper and last longer than the other reversals over the past 7 weeks. But until there is a reversal, traders will continue to expect higher prices.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The yearend Small Pullback Bull Trend bull channel that began on November 10 could continue up for a few more weeks, but the Emini will probably pull back for at least a couple weeks soon. This should begin in late December or early January.<p>The Emini has also been in a tight trading range for 3 weeks. Even though yesterday made another new high, it did not break far above the top of the range. Consequently, the Emini might still be in the range instead of beginning a new leg up. But if the bulls get consecutive big bull bars closing far above the 3-week range, traders will conclude that the rally will probably continue up for at least a measured move, based on the 3-week range.<p>If the Emini reverses down this week, there will be a wedge top. The tops of 1st 2 legs up were on November 16 and December 9. Traders would expect the reversal to test the start of the wedge, which was the November 10 low, just below 3500.<p>With most days for 2 months having at least one swing up and one swing down, traders will expect that again today. Furthermore, most days have closed either in the middle of the day’s range or near the open. Those 2 prices could be magnets again today in the final hour.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 17 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up to a new all-time high. The bulls want the rally to accelerate up for a measured move that is based on the 100-point height of the 3 week trading range. If they get a couple consecutive bars closing on their highs on the daily chart, traders will expect the rally to continue up. It would increase the chance of several bull trend days over the next week.<p>Whenever there is a breakout, there is usually about a 50% chance it will fail. The market often goes sideways for a few days, as traders decide if the breakout will continue up or reverse down. There is a slightly increased chance that the Emini could trend up or down strongly. However, with the daily chart overbought and the Emini gapping above a trading range, the Emini will probably be sideways for a day or two as traders decide if the breakout will succeed or fail.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-FOMC-trading-range-day-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-17.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC trading range day at all time high in yearend small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

They want the rally to continue up to the February 2018 major lower high above 1.25, without more than a 3-day pullback.<p>However, this is the 3rd leg up, and the 3 legs are forming a 3rd leg up on the weekly chart. If there is a reversal down within the next few weeks, there would be a nested wedge top. Traders would look for the selloff to last at least a couple weeks.<p>There is no sign of a top and traders expect higher prices. But the EURUSD is now at a couple of measured move targets.

Most days for the past 7 weeks closed near the open or midpoint of the day’s range. The large number of these neutral bars in the rally from the October 30 low, increases the chance of a pullback lasting for a two to three weeks beginning by early January. The minimum target is around the November 10 low and 3,500, which is the start of the current Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>Many traders are buying into the end of the year, expecting the 9-month rally to last into January. They want the year to close on its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices in January.<p>But if the Emini begins to turn down, those bulls might exit quickly. Their long covering (selling out of their longs) could create a surprisingly fast drop into the end of the year.<p>There is no reversal yet, and therefore traders continue to expect at least slightly higher prices every day. But if the Emini reverses down in the next few days, traders would see the selloff as a wedge reversal after 3 legs up. The 1st two tops were November 16 and December 9. A reversal from a wedge top usually has at least a couple legs down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 3 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a small, sideways day. That increases the chance of more trading range trading today.<p>Because the Emini is overbought, there is an increased chance of either a reversal down, or an acceleration up into a blow-off top at any time. Also, we are near the end of the year. Markets often make big moves just before or just after a bar closes. The bars on the yearly and monthly charts close in two weeks. That means that there could be a surprisingly big move in either direction.<p>It is important to understand that a surprise is a low probability event. That means it is more likely that nothing big will happen on any given day. Day traders expect that today will behave like most of the days over the past 7 weeks. The days have had both a swing up and a swing down, and a lot of trading range trading.<h3>Expect huge volume just before 1 pm PST today</h3><p>There is one special event today that will probably result in a dramatic move at the end of the day. Tesla enters the S&amp;P500 index on Monday. There are many huge funds that track the S&amp;P exactly. They therefore will have to own Tesla at today’s close. Today is also quadruple witching, which also will add to the volume of trading.<p>With Tesla being a $600 billion company, huge volume in Tesla will probably affect the index and all of its derivatives. The Emini is a derivative. Therefore, even if the Emini is quiet all day, traders should expect a lot of volume at the end of the day. Bar 78 on the 5-minute chart, the 1 pm PST bar, typically has the biggest volume of the day, because it corresponds to the close of the stock market.<p>The Emini will have extremely big volume during bar 78 today, with much of it coming in the final 20 seconds before 1 pm. This could also result in a huge bar. While a bull bar is more likely, it could be down as well if enough firms front-run the Tesla entry and overdid their buying.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-doji-day-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-18.png\" alt=\"Emini doji day and trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bears want a sell signal bar for a wedge top at two measured move targets .<p>However, after two big bull bars closing on their highs, traders typically will buy the 1st reversal down. Therefore, even if today closes on its low, and becomes a good sell signal bar, the reversal down will probably only last one or two days. But if the bull trend resumed, which is likely, and then there was a 2nd reversal down next week, the bears would have a better chance of a trend reversal.<p>However, even if the EURUSD sold off for a few weeks, it probably would not continue down into a bear trend. This is because the 2-month bull channel has been tight. A reversal down after a tight bull channel usually leads to a trading range, and not a bear trend. Once there is a trading range, there is usually both a double top and a double bottom. At that point, the bears would have a 40% chance of an actual trend reversal down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has had many reversals in a small range overnight. Forex day traders have been scalping for 10 pips.<p>The bears know that today will probably grow into a big bear day. They simply want a sign that the bull trend on the daily chart is stalling. For example, they would like today to be small, and possibly stay within yesterday’s range. More importantly, they want today to close near the low of the day. While they know that the sell signal on the daily chart would be minor, they would be one step closer to getting a trend reversal over the next couple weeks.<p>The bulls want a 3rd consecutive big bull day closing on its high. However, the past 2 days were likely exhaustive, and that is therefore unlikely. At a minimum, they would like the day to close near the open. They want to avoid having today be a strong sell signal bar. A neutral close today would increase the chance of higher prices next week, even if Monday pulled back.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-down-day-but-late-bull-trend-reversal-ahead-of-Tesla-entering-SP500-index.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down day but late bull trend reversal ahead of Tesla entering S&amp;P500 index\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It sold off again to the open of the week and rallied strongly into the close. That strong, late rally was fueled in part by funds buying Tesla ahead of it being added to the S&amp;P500 index ahead of the open on Monday.<p>Today was an outside down day, but closed near its high. This week also closed near its high.

The bears want a sell signal bar for a wedge top at two measured move targets .<p>However, after two big bull bars closing on their highs, traders typically will buy the 1st reversal down. Therefore, even if today closes on its low, and becomes a good sell signal bar, the reversal down will probably only last one or two days. But if the bull trend resumed, which is likely, and then there was a 2nd reversal down next week, the bears would have a better chance of a trend reversal.<p>However, even if the EURUSD sold off for a few weeks, it probably would not continue down into a bear trend. This is because the 2-month bull channel has been tight. A reversal down after a tight bull channel usually leads to a trading range, and not a bear trend. Once there is a trading range, there is usually both a double top and a double bottom. At that point, the bears would have a 40% chance of an actual trend reversal down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has had many reversals in a small range overnight. Forex day traders have been scalping for 10 pips.<p>The bears know that today will probably grow into a big bear day. They simply want a sign that the bull trend on the daily chart is stalling. For example, they would like today to be small, and possibly stay within yesterday’s range. More importantly, they want today to close near the low of the day. While they know that the sell signal on the daily chart would be minor, they would be one step closer to getting a trend reversal over the next couple weeks.<p>The bulls want a 3rd consecutive big bull day closing on its high. However, the past 2 days were likely exhaustive, and that is therefore unlikely. At a minimum, they would like the day to close near the open. They want to avoid having today be a strong sell signal bar. A neutral close today would increase the chance of higher prices next week, even if Monday pulled back.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-down-day-but-late-bull-trend-reversal-ahead-of-Tesla-entering-SP500-index.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down day but late bull trend reversal ahead of Tesla entering S&amp;P500 index\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Most days for the past 7 weeks closed near the open or midpoint of the day’s range. The large number of these neutral bars in the rally from the October 30 low, increases the chance of a pullback lasting for a two to three weeks beginning by early January. The minimum target is around the November 10 low and 3,500, which is the start of the current Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>Many traders are buying into the end of the year, expecting the 9-month rally to last into January. They want the year to close on its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices in January.<p>But if the Emini begins to turn down, those bulls might exit quickly. Their long covering (selling out of their longs) could create a surprisingly fast drop into the end of the year.<p>There is no reversal yet, and therefore traders continue to expect at least slightly higher prices every day. But if the Emini reverses down in the next few days, traders would see the selloff as a wedge reversal after 3 legs up. The 1st two tops were November 16 and December 9. A reversal from a wedge top usually has at least a couple legs down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 3 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a small, sideways day. That increases the chance of more trading range trading today.<p>Because the Emini is overbought, there is an increased chance of either a reversal down, or an acceleration up into a blow-off top at any time. Also, we are near the end of the year. Markets often make big moves just before or just after a bar closes. The bars on the yearly and monthly charts close in two weeks. That means that there could be a surprisingly big move in either direction.<p>It is important to understand that a surprise is a low probability event. That means it is more likely that nothing big will happen on any given day. Day traders expect that today will behave like most of the days over the past 7 weeks. The days have had both a swing up and a swing down, and a lot of trading range trading.<h3>Expect huge volume just before 1 pm PST today</h3><p>There is one special event today that will probably result in a dramatic move at the end of the day. Tesla enters the S&amp;P500 index on Monday. There are many huge funds that track the S&amp;P exactly. They therefore will have to own Tesla at today’s close. Today is also quadruple witching, which also will add to the volume of trading.<p>With Tesla being a $600 billion company, huge volume in Tesla will probably affect the index and all of its derivatives. The Emini is a derivative. Therefore, even if the Emini is quiet all day, traders should expect a lot of volume at the end of the day. Bar 78 on the 5-minute chart, the 1 pm PST bar, typically has the biggest volume of the day, because it corresponds to the close of the stock market.<p>The Emini will have extremely big volume during bar 78 today, with much of it coming in the final 20 seconds before 1 pm. This could also result in a huge bar. While a bull bar is more likely, it could be down as well if enough firms front-run the Tesla entry and overdid their buying.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-doji-day-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-18.png\" alt=\"Emini doji day and trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

market is rallying into the end of the year. But the bars on the daily chart are weak, and there is a nested wedge on the weekly chart. This increases the risk of a pullback to 3,500 starting by early January.<p>The<strong>Bond futures</strong>weekly chart has an ii pattern at the apex of a 9-month triangle. Traders should expect a breakout up or down soon.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is rallying strongly, but there is the potential for a nested wedge top to develop in the next few weeks. There will probably be a pullback lasting at least two to three weeks before the rally reaches the February 2018 high above 1.25.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-weekly-chart-has-an-ii-at-apex-of-a-triangle\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart has an ii at apex of a triangle</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-with-ii-pattern-at-apex-of-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-19.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart with ii pattern at apex of triangle\"></a></figure><p>The low on this week’s weekly bond futures chart is above last week’s low. Also, the high is below last week’s high. This week is therefore an inside bar on the weekly chart. Furthermore, it is the 2nd consecutive inside bar. That is an ii (inside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. It increases the chance of a trend up or down beginning next week.<p>When a chart is in Breakout Mode, there generally is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail. Also, there is a 50% chance that the eventual successful breakout will be up, and a 50% chance it will be down.<p>Traders adjust the percentages based on context (the bars to the left). With the bond market trending down in a Small Pullback Bear Trend since August, the probability is slightly greater for the bear breakout. But not much. If it was much greater, the bonds would already be breaking out.<p>The market can only be sideways if the number of dollars buying equals the number selling. You must assume that the bulls and bears are balanced at the moment, despite the consensus that rate will be higher several years from now.<p>The market might have to reach the bull trend line before traders decide on the direction of the breakout. It can get there by going sideways for a couple more weeks, or by going a little down.<h3 id=\"3-apex-of-9-month-triangle\">Apex of 9-month triangle</h3><p>It is important to note that the weekly bond futures chart is at the bottom of a 9-month triangle. It is also at the apex, which increases the chance of a breakout up or down coming soon.<p>If everyone knows that interest rates are going up, which means that bonds are going down, why aren’t bonds going down now? Because this is a crowded trade. What that means is that a lot of institutions expecting higher interest rates might have already positioned themselves for this. There might not be enough other institutions willing to sell at this price, and time to drive the bond futures lower.<h3 id=\"4-possible-short-covering-rally\">Possible short-covering rally</h3><p>Many of those shorts will get nervous if the bear breakout does not come soon. What do nervous bears do? They buy back some or all of their shorts. The result can be a bond rally that could last a month or more, even though everyone knows rates are eventually going up.<p>Remember, “early” in trading means wrong. Those institutions who loaded up on shorts can get squeezed out. With/if enough panic around the same time, there can be a sharp rally in the bond market, even though the bond market might have begun a bear trend in March.<p>Bear trends have rallies, and some can be strong and last a long time. I am not predicting a rally to above the March high. There is only a 30% chance of a breakout above the March high at this point. But there could easily be a bounce back to the middle, or even the top of the 9-month range.<p>Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Legs in trading ranges are always more likely to reverse than to lead to a successful breakout. Consequently, it is still more likely that the bond market will go up for at least a week or two, before breaking strongly below the June low.<p>But I have said many times this year that the bond market will be lower 5 and 10 years from now. That is still true. That does not preclude it from being higher 5 days or even 5 weeks from now. Until there are consecutive closes below the bottom of the trading range, the bond market is still mostly neutral, despite the long-term negative bias.<h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"6-eurusd-weekly-chart-rallying-strongly-but-in-a-3rd-leg-up\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart rallying strongly but in a 3rd leg up</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-with-bull-breakout-but-possible-nested-wedge-soon.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-19-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart with bull breakout but possible nested wedge soon\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart formed a big bull bar this week, and it closed near the high of the bar. It is the 3rd push up in the strong rally from the November 4 low.<p>If there is a reversal after 3 legs up in a tight bull channel, there is a parabolic wedge top. That would make a couple legs down likely. But there is no reversal yet, and there are two important magnets above. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>The more important of the magnets is the February 2018 lower high. That was the start of a 2-year bear trend. The other magnet is the top of the 10-month bull channel that began in March. The 1st 2 points of the channel are the March 9 and September 1 highs.<p>What happens if the EURUSD reverses down from around the top of the 10-month bull channel? Traders would see that as a wedge reversal.<p>But remember that I just said that there is a possible small parabolic wedge that began at the November 4 low. That wedge is the 3rd leg up in the bigger wedge bull channel that began in March. There is therefore a nested wedge pattern. If the bears get a reversal down in the next few weeks, there would be an increased chance of at least a couple legs down on the weekly chart. Also, when there is a wedge reversal, it usually falls to the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the November low around 1.16.<h3 id=\"7-what-is-likely-at-the-end-of-2020\">What is likely at the end of 2020?</h3><p>The EURUSD has been trending up strongly since March. It will probably be at least a little higher next week. The bulls want the year to close on the high of the year. Traders would then expect higher prices into at least early January.<p>The EURUSD will eventually reach the February 2018 high above 1.25, but not necessarily in the next couple months. While the February 2018 high is a strong magnet, a magnet in a bull trend is also resistance. Therefore, the EURUSD might reverse down from that high, or even from far below that high.<p>Also, the EURUSD is near the top of a bull channel. There is usually at least some profit taking when a market gets to the top of a bull channel. Look back at August when the market formed the top of the 2nd leg up in the channel. The EURUSD went sideways for 2 months. There should be at least a pause for a couple weeks around the top of the channel.<p>If the profit taking is strong, the bears could get a good sell signal bar, or a micro double top. If either were to happen, traders would start to wonder if the nested wedge top was going to lead to a reversal down for several weeks.<h2 id=\"8-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"9-monthly-emini-chart-is-forming-a-small-bull-follow-through-bar-in-december\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart is forming a small bull follow-through bar in December</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-withfollow-through-after-bull-breakout-but-top-of-10-year-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-19-2.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart with follow through after bull breakout but top of 10-year bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a bull bar so far in December. The bulls want this month to close near its high. After a big bull bar in November, that would increase the chance of higher prices in January.<p>However, right before a bar closes on any timeframe, there is often a sharp move that significantly alters the appearance of the bar. December 31 is the close of a week, a month, a quarter, and a year. Some institutions concentrate on one time frame while others focus on a different time frame. But when many time frames end at the same time, there is an increased chance of lots of institutions acting simultaneously, which could result in a big move in either direction.<p>This is especially true with the monthly chart being in a buy climax. When a rally is climactic, there is an increased chance of an acceleration up into a blow-off top, and of a reversal down.<h3 id=\"10-can-the-bears-get-an-end-of-the-year-selloff\">Can the bears get an end-of-the-year selloff?</h3><p>While this month is currently a bull bar closing on its high, if there is a 50-point selloff by the end of the year, December will close near the open of the month. It would then be neutral, which would disappoint the bulls. If enough disappointed bulls exit, January could reverse much of December.<p>If that were to happen, there would be an increased chance of at least a couple legs sideways to down. This is because the High 1 bull flag in October was a bear bar. September was also a bear bar. When a bull flag has bear bars and it is late in a bull trend, the breakout is typically brief. In addition, the pullback typically has a couple legs sideways to down. Consequently, a reversal in late December, or in January, could lead to a test of the middle or bottom of the trading range that began in September. Therefore, there is an increased chance of about a 10% pullback to below 3,500 beginning within a month.<h3 id=\"11-will-2021-gap-up-on-the-yearly-chart\">Will 2021 gap up on the yearly chart?</h3><p>I will post the yearly chart at the end of the year. If December closes on its high, the year will close on its high. If the Emini were to gap up on January 4, when 2021 begins trading, there would then also be a gap up on the weekly, monthly, and yearly charts.<p>I do not know if the stock market has ever gapped up on the yearly chart. But if it does, the gap would be small on that chart. Small gaps typically close before the bar closes. A bar on the yearly chart takes a year to close. Therefore, if there is a gap up, it could stay open for many months.<p>That is unlikely. The gap would also be small on the monthly chart. Traders would expect it to close before the end of January. If it is small on the weekly chart as well, they will expect it to close in the 1st week of 2021.<h2 id=\"12-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-might-form-a-nested-wedge-top\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart might form a nested wedge top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-strong-bull-trend-but-possible-nested-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-19-3.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 futures weekly chart in strong bull trend but possible nested wedge top. An Emini rally risk of reversal.\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a bull bar this week, and it closed near its high. Because it is coming in a strong, 10-month bull trend, traders continue to expect at least slightly higher prices.<p>However, this week is the 3rd push up in the past 6 weeks. If there is a reversal down next week, the rally would be a micro wedge top. A micro wedge on the weekly chart is a traditional wedge on the daily chart.<p>The rally up from the March low has been extremely strong. There was only one 3-week pullback. All of the other pullbacks ended after just a week or two.<p>But if there is a reversal down from a micro wedge, it should have at least a couple small legs sideways to down. That would take at least 3 or 4 weeks. Consequently, if a pullback begins in the next few weeks, it will probably last longer than any other pullback since the pandemic low. At a minimum, traders would expect it to test the start of the micro wedge. That is the November 10 low, which is also around the 3,500 Big Round Number.<h3 id=\"13-first-reversal-down-in-strong-bull-trend-is-usually-minor\">First reversal down in strong bull trend is usually minor</h3><p>Can a reversal down be the start of a bear trend? Probably not. The rally from the March low has been in a tight bull channel. A reversal down in a Small Pullback Bull Trend is typically minor. That means it becomes a bull flag, or it is a bear leg in what will become a trading range. If it is the start of a trading range, traders would expect a bull leg and a test of the high before there is a bear trend.<p>But if the Emini enters a trading range and then has a reversal, the reversal will come from a double top. If there was a good sell signal bar in addition to the double top, there would be a 40% chance of a bear trend.<h3 id=\"14-possible-nested-wedge-top\">Possible nested wedge top</h3><p>In addition to the micro wedge over the past 6 weeks, the rally from the September 24 low has had 3 legs up. The 1st top was the October 12 high and the 2nd was the November 9 high. Therefore, the micro wedge is nested within a bigger wedge. Nested patterns have a higher probability of leading to at least a couple legs down.<p>Wedges often do not have a wedge shape. For example, this bigger wedge does not look very much like a wedge. This will result in fewer institutions expecting it to lead to a significant reversal down.<p>There is another bigger wedge as well. The entire rally from the March low has had 3 legs up. The 1st ended with the June 5 high, and the 2nd ended on September 2. The two other wedges are nested within it.<p>But since none of the wedges look like a conventional wedge, traders will be less inclined to expect them to behave like traditional wedges. That reduces the chance of a big reversal down. However, the climactic rally from the March low and the micro wedge, are enough to expect a pullback to begin by early January, and for it to have at least a couple small legs down.<h2 id=\"15-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-wedge-rally-in-a-small-pullback-bull-trend\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has wedge rally in a Small Pullback Bull Trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-in-strong-bull-trend-but-possible-wedge-bull-channel-in-Spike-and-Channel-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-19-4.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart in strong bull trend but possible wedge bull channel in Spike and Channel Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied strongly to a new high from the November 10 low. The rally has been a Small Pullback Bull Trend, which is a very strong type of bull trend. A strong version of it has at least a couple breakouts, with consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs. When that happens, the rally will often last far more than 50 bars<p>But the current rally has lacked that aggressive buying. That makes it more likely to be a bull leg in a trading range. A trading range has bull and bear legs. Therefore, when there is a strong bull leg, traders begin to expect a bear leg to begin soon. That is the case here.<p>There is another problem with the rally. About 75% of the bars since late October closed near the open or middle of the bar. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday were examples. Those bars are neutral instead of bullish. A bull trend that continues for a long time typically has far more bull bars closing near their highs. This lack of strong bull bars further increases the chance of a two to three week pullback beginning by early January.<h3 id=\"16-possible-black-swan-event-in-january\">Possible Black Swan event in January</h3><p>Then, there is Washington, D.C. The politicians are going to behave well through the January 5 Georgia senate elections. However, the following two weeks will be the end of Trump’s presidency, which has been very emotional. There is an increased chance of significant and bad decisions from both sides, and from other countries, during those two weeks. I suspect there is a 30% chance of a Black Swan event appearing during that window. So what could it be? If I knew, it would not be a Black Swan!<p>As for the current rally, there is no top yet. Traders continue to expect at least slightly higher prices. But the lack of strong thrusts up make it likely that the rally will not last much longer.<h2 id=\"17-what-about-tesla-and-the-sampp500\">What about Tesla and the S&amp;P500?</h2><p><a aria-label=\"Tesla is getting added to the S&amp;P500 index on Monday. (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/traders-brace-for-wild-action-and-historic-volume-ahead-of-teslas-entry-into-the-sp-500.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Tesla is getting added to the S&amp;P500 index before the open on Monday.</a>The S&amp;P500 index has never added a $600 billion company before, and it will be interesting to see what happens on Monday. There are huge funds that track the S&amp;P, and they bought Tesla in the final seconds on Friday.<p>Those funds have one goal and it is to mirror the S&amp;P. It is not to beat it. They therefore had to buy Tesla into the close on Friday. There are also lots of funds that unofficially or loosely track the S&amp;P, and they bought as well. That is why Tesla on Friday had such huge volume at the end of the day. Those funds that mirror the S&amp;P could not buy Tesla sooner, and they can not wait a couple weeks to buy it a pullback.<p>Everyone knows that, and lots of other firms have been buying it in advance, knowing that there was going to be forced buying on Friday’s close. If you ran a hedge fund that bought ahead of Friday because you knew Friday would have lots of Tesla buyers on Friday’s close, and there clearly will be no one to buy Tesla after Monday, what will you do on Monday or Tuesday? SELL!!<h3 id=\"18-when-something-obviously-will-happen-it-usually-does-not-happen\">When something obviously will happen, it usually does not happen</h3><p>It is so obvious that Tesla would rally at the end of the day on Friday, and sell off on Monday or Tuesday that everyone knows it. Whenever something is obvious, it is a crowded trade, and it typically will not do what it obviously should do.<p>For example, many funds that wanted to buy ahead of time might have decided that it was already too expensive. They then might wait to buy later next week after a pullback. If there are lots of funds thinking this way, Tesla may go up this week instead of down.<p>What if there is severe selling on Monday, or next week, that it scares institutions who are not in Tesla? They might wonder if the collapse in Tesla (if it collapses, which is unlikely) might be a sign that there will be lots of tax selling of all stocks into the end of 2020, just in case Biden wins the senate on January 5 and raises taxes for 2021.<p>The point is that there is the potential for surprises in Tesla next week, which can cause a big move up, down, or in both directions. If there is also a big move in the market, will it be caused by Tesla? Not necessarily, but there will be a consensus that Tesla was the trigger. Tesla therefore will probably be a bellwether for the overall market.<p>Incidentally, there is research that shows that when a big market cap company gets added to the S&amp;P, the stock is down as much as 7% a year later. With Tesla being extremely overbought, it could fall much more. Over the next month, it might put in its high for many years. If it were to reverse down, the 3-month triangle at 400 would be an obvious target.<p>Also, a stock that gets kicked out is up an average of 20% a year later. Tesla is replacing AIV. If you look at its chart, you will see that it fell 87% earlier this week. Don’t blame Tesla. AIV spun off part of its business into a 2nd publicly traded company, and that is the cause of the huge gap down.<h2 id=\"19-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini made a new all-time high on Friday, but then became an outside down bar.<p>The bears hope that the overnight selloff will lead to a gap down. Remember, I have been saying that the Emini would probably begin a 10% selloff by early January. If today gaps down and closes near its low, traders will begin to believe that this could be the start of the selloff. The bulls hope it is just another 1- to 3-day pullback in its 5-week Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>On the Globex chart, there was another all-time high overnight and then today became a 2nd consecutive outside bar. Consecutive outside bars is an OO (outside-outside) Breakout Mode pattern. If tomorrow trades above today’s high, traders will look for a measured move up based on today’s 100-point range. If tomorrow or any day in the next few days trades below today’s low, they will look for a 100-point drop below over the next few days.<h3>Tesla could be a bellwether</h3><p>Tesla was added to the S&amp;P500 before the open today. It is extremely overbought. Just before the close on Friday, institutions with funds that track the S&amp;P were forced to buy it. The firms that bought it over the past month have quick, big profits. They might take those profits today. If there is a strong reversal down this week, Tesla might be putting in its high for the next several years.<p>Since Tesla is a $600 billion stock, it could be a bellwether for the market. If it starts to sell off, traders might take profits on all of their positions going into the end of the year.<p>Can the opposite happen? Can the Emini race up from here? Pretty much anything has a 30% chance. This is an example. It is more likely that the Emini will begin to pullback either this week, or within the next few weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 60 points in the Globex session and it will probably gap down. However, it rallied 50 points up from the Globex low. Big Down, Big Up creates Big Confusion. Confusion typically results in a trading range, and the Emini has been in a 20-point range for the past 3 hours in the Globex session. This increases the chance that today will have some trading range trading. That means at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>Today will also likely gap to below the bottom of the 5-week bull channel. I have been saying that a bull channel is a bear flag. I wrote that markets usually break below bull channels, and evolve into trading ranges. This could be the start. A common target for the bottom of the range is the beginning of the bull channel. That was the November 10 low at around 3500.<p>The more today closes below its midpoint and the more bear bars over the next week, the more traders will expect a pullback to below 3500. But if today closes above the midpoint, traders will expect more sideways trading. If they the get a bull bar closing near its high this week, the bulls will hope that the selloff will be a bull flag and that the year will close on the high.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-down-day-but-late-bull-trend-reversal-ahead-of-Tesla-entering-SP500-index.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-21.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down day but late bull trend reversal ahead of Tesla entering S&amp;P500 index\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Friday was a bear bar and therefore a sell signal bar. But it only had a small bear body and it followed two big bull bars. That is a weak sell setup. If this is the start of a 3-week pullback to the November 9 high Breakout Point, the bears will need several bear bars closing near their lows.<p>So far, today is trading above the midpoint of the day’s range. That, plus the weak sell signal bar in a strong bull trend, makes today more likely just the start of a 3-day bull flag, than the beginning of a bear trend. Today’s close and what the EURUSD does over the next few days will tell traders if this is instead going to lead to a 3-week selloff.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off sharply at the start of the European session, but has reversed back up almost to the start of that selloff. With several overnight reversals, day traders are trading in both directions and taking quick profits. The reversals make them hesitant to hold onto their positions. The legs up and down so far have been big enough for 40- to 50-pip trades.<p>However, since this is probably evolving into a trading range, the legs will get smaller and day traders will switch to taking 20-pip scalps. If the EURUSD becomes very quiet, they will scalp for just 10 pips.<p>Can today trend strongly up or down before the end of the day? With several reversals, traders will expect more reversals. The fight will be over the close of the day.<p>The bears want the day to close below its midpoint. That will increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow. But if there is a prominent tail below on the daily chart, traders will expect only sideways to down trading tomorrow.<p>If the EURUSD closes near the high of the day, today would be a credible buy signal bar on the daily chart. However, since the day would have a big tail below, traders will see it as a less reliable buy signal. It would increase the chance that tomorrow would be either sideways or slightly up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It reversed up from both a wedge and parabolic wedge. The rally was a huge Small Pullback Bull Trend. Today is now a buy signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The bulls want the year to close on its high, which would increase the chance that January would gap up. That would create a gap on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. However, the odds still favor a pullback to below 3500 starting by the 2nd week of January.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

If it starts to sell off, traders might take profits on all of their positions going into the end of the year.<p>Can the opposite happen? Can the Emini race up from here? Pretty much anything has a 30% chance. This is an example. It is more likely that the Emini will begin to pullback either this week, or within the next few weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 60 points in the Globex session and it will probably gap down. However, it rallied 50 points up from the Globex low. Big Down, Big Up creates Big Confusion. Confusion typically results in a trading range, and the Emini has been in a 20-point range for the past 3 hours in the Globex session. This increases the chance that today will have some trading range trading. That means at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>Today will also likely gap to below the bottom of the 5-week bull channel. I have been saying that a bull channel is a bear flag. I wrote that markets usually break below bull channels, and evolve into trading ranges. This could be the start. A common target for the bottom of the range is the beginning of the bull channel. That was the November 10 low at around 3500.<p>The more today closes below its midpoint and the more bear bars over the next week, the more traders will expect a pullback to below 3500. But if today closes above the midpoint, traders will expect more sideways trading. If they the get a bull bar closing near its high this week, the bulls will hope that the selloff will be a bull flag and that the year will close on the high.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-down-day-but-late-bull-trend-reversal-ahead-of-Tesla-entering-SP500-index.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-21.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down day but late bull trend reversal ahead of Tesla entering S&amp;P500 index\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Friday was a bear bar and therefore a sell signal bar. But it only had a small bear body and it followed two big bull bars. That is a weak sell setup. If this is the start of a 3-week pullback to the November 9 high Breakout Point, the bears will need several bear bars closing near their lows.<p>So far, today is trading above the midpoint of the day’s range. That, plus the weak sell signal bar in a strong bull trend, makes today more likely just the start of a 3-day bull flag, than the beginning of a bear trend. Today’s close and what the EURUSD does over the next few days will tell traders if this is instead going to lead to a 3-week selloff.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off sharply at the start of the European session, but has reversed back up almost to the start of that selloff. With several overnight reversals, day traders are trading in both directions and taking quick profits. The reversals make them hesitant to hold onto their positions. The legs up and down so far have been big enough for 40- to 50-pip trades.<p>However, since this is probably evolving into a trading range, the legs will get smaller and day traders will switch to taking 20-pip scalps. If the EURUSD becomes very quiet, they will scalp for just 10 pips.<p>Can today trend strongly up or down before the end of the day? With several reversals, traders will expect more reversals. The fight will be over the close of the day.<p>The bears want the day to close below its midpoint. That will increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow. But if there is a prominent tail below on the daily chart, traders will expect only sideways to down trading tomorrow.<p>If the EURUSD closes near the high of the day, today would be a credible buy signal bar on the daily chart. However, since the day would have a big tail below, traders will see it as a less reliable buy signal. It would increase the chance that tomorrow would be either sideways or slightly up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It reversed up from both a wedge and parabolic wedge. The rally was a huge Small Pullback Bull Trend. Today is now a buy signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The bulls want the year to close on its high, which would increase the chance that January would gap up. That would create a gap on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. However, the odds still favor a pullback to below 3500 starting by the 2nd week of January.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini made a new all-time high on Friday, but then became an outside down bar.<p>The bears hope that the overnight selloff will lead to a gap down. Remember, I have been saying that the Emini would probably begin a 10% selloff by early January. If today gaps down and closes near its low, traders will begin to believe that this could be the start of the selloff. The bulls hope it is just another 1- to 3-day pullback in its 5-week Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>On the Globex chart, there was another all-time high overnight and then today became a 2nd consecutive outside bar. Consecutive outside bars is an OO (outside-outside) Breakout Mode pattern. If tomorrow trades above today’s high, traders will look for a measured move up based on today’s 100-point range. If tomorrow or any day in the next few days trades below today’s low, they will look for a 100-point drop below over the next few days.<h3>Tesla could be a bellwether</h3><p>Tesla was added to the S&amp;P500 before the open today. It is extremely overbought. Just before the close on Friday, institutions with funds that track the S&amp;P were forced to buy it. The firms that bought it over the past month have quick, big profits. They might take those profits today. If there is a strong reversal down this week, Tesla might be putting in its high for the next several years.<p>Since Tesla is a $600 billion stock, it could be a bellwether for the market. If it starts to sell off, traders might take profits on all of their positions going into the end of the year.<p>Can the opposite happen? Can the Emini race up from here? Pretty much anything has a 30% chance. This is an example. It is more likely that the Emini will begin to pullback either this week, or within the next few weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 60 points in the Globex session and it will probably gap down. However, it rallied 50 points up from the Globex low. Big Down, Big Up creates Big Confusion. Confusion typically results in a trading range, and the Emini has been in a 20-point range for the past 3 hours in the Globex session. This increases the chance that today will have some trading range trading. That means at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>Today will also likely gap to below the bottom of the 5-week bull channel. I have been saying that a bull channel is a bear flag. I wrote that markets usually break below bull channels, and evolve into trading ranges. This could be the start. A common target for the bottom of the range is the beginning of the bull channel.

But if today closes above the midpoint, traders will expect more sideways trading.

The selloff was also a test of the open of the month and last week’s low.<p>Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar for today. The bulls want the year to close on its high. They then want 2021 to gap up to a new high. That would create a gap up on the yearly chart, which might not have ever happened before in the history of the stock market (I have not checked).<p>The day after a buy climax day usually has at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. There is only a 25% chance of a 2nd strong bull trend day. If today is a bull trend day, it will probably be a weaker type of bull trend, like a broad bull channel, or a Trending Trading Range day.<p>Can today be a strong bear day? While its always possible, a selloff today would more likely lead to a trading range day and not a bear trend.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. The bulls want s resumption of yesterday’s strong rally. At a minimum, they want today to go above yesterday’s high. That would trigger a buy signal on the daily chart.<p>But yesterday had a big tail on top and the Emini is back in the middle of its 3-week range. This is not a strong buy setup on the daily chart, which reduces the chance of a big bull trend day.<p>Yesterday rallied strongly, but was sideways for the final 4 hours. Today will probably open in yesterday’s late trading range. But with yesterday’s rally being so strong, traders expect at least some trend resumption up today. With the Emini closing near yesterday’s high, traders expect today to trade above yesterday’s high. That would trigger the buy signal on the daily chart.<p>However, yesterday had a huge range. Traders who buy above have a stop far below. Many traders do not want to risk too much, especially in a trading range. That reduces the number of bulls who will buy aggressively above yesterday’s high. Also, as I wrote above, the day after a climactic rally typically has at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. That further reduces the chance of a big bull trend today.<p>Yesterday’s pullbacks were small. The bulls were relentless. That makes a strong bear trend day unlikely.<p>Traders expect today to test yesterday’s high, not form a bear trend day, and be either sideways or have a bullish bias. However, we are at the end of the year, and the year has been incredibly strong. That increases the chance of a strong trend up or down in the remaining days of 2020. It is more likely that the Emini will wait for next year before deciding on the direction of the breakout of the 3-week range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-22.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and Small Pullback Bull Trend.

Yesterday reversed up and became a buy signal bar. Today triggered the buy signal by going above yesterday’s high. However, it did not yet go above Friday’s high, and the EURUSD is therefore still on the sell signal.<p>The sell signal was weak because a small bear doji is usually insufficient to reverse a strong bull trend. Yesterday’s buy signal is also weak. This is because it had a big tail and a small body. That is a big doji, which is typically more of a trading range bar than the start of a bull trend.<p>When there is a weak signal, fewer traders are willing to bet on a trend. Also, the entry is typically weak. That disappoints the traders who took the signal, and they tend to take quick profits. The result is usually a small trading range. Consequently, the EURUSD will probably go more sideways for a couple days than up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off a little overnight, but then reversed up to just above yesterday’s high. This triggered the buy signal on the daily chart. However, the rally barely went above yesterday’s high, and then reversed back down to yesterday’s close and today’s open.<p>While today is a bull reversal day, it is small. Also, the rally turned down from resistance. The reversal down so far is minor, and the reversal up was reasonably strong. That makes it likely that the bulls will test yesterday’s high again. They will therefore probably buy this pullback. However, the bears were able to reverse the market down from just after triggering the daily buy signal. They probably will sell again around yesterday’s high.<p>With sellers above and buyers below, the EURUSD will probably be in a trading range today. Since the daily chart is in a bull trend, and there were reversals up yesterday and today, if there is a trend today, up is more likely. However, the overnight trading has had several small reversals in a relatively small range. Day traders will probably look to scalp for the remainder of the day, unless there is a strong series of bars in either direction.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trading-open-and-then-reveral-up-from-sell-climax-and-ii-into-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading open and then reveral up from sell climax and ii into trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It remained in a trading range all day. The bulls want trend resumption up after yesterday’s strong rally, and they will probably try again tomorrow.<p>The Emini has been in a trading range of 4 weeks. Traders are deciding how the year will end. The bulls want a new high, which would increase the chance of a continued rally into early 2021. The bears want a break below the trading range and then a measured move down to below 3500. Whether or not there is a rally into early January, the Emini will probably sell off to below 3500 starting by early January.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The selloff was also a test of the open of the month and last week’s low.<p>Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar for today. The bulls want the year to close on its high. They then want 2021 to gap up to a new high. That would create a gap up on the yearly chart, which might not have ever happened before in the history of the stock market (I have not checked).<p>The day after a buy climax day usually has at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. There is only a 25% chance of a 2nd strong bull trend day. If today is a bull trend day, it will probably be a weaker type of bull trend, like a broad bull channel, or a Trending Trading Range day.<p>Can today be a strong bear day? While its always possible, a selloff today would more likely lead to a trading range day and not a bear trend.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. The bulls want s resumption of yesterday’s strong rally. At a minimum, they want today to go above yesterday’s high. That would trigger a buy signal on the daily chart.<p>But yesterday had a big tail on top and the Emini is back in the middle of its 3-week range. This is not a strong buy setup on the daily chart, which reduces the chance of a big bull trend day.<p>Yesterday rallied strongly, but was sideways for the final 4 hours. Today will probably open in yesterday’s late trading range. But with yesterday’s rally being so strong, traders expect at least some trend resumption up today. With the Emini closing near yesterday’s high, traders expect today to trade above yesterday’s high. That would trigger the buy signal on the daily chart.<p>However, yesterday had a huge range. Traders who buy above have a stop far below. Many traders do not want to risk too much, especially in a trading range. That reduces the number of bulls who will buy aggressively above yesterday’s high. Also, as I wrote above, the day after a climactic rally typically has at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour. That further reduces the chance of a big bull trend today.<p>Yesterday’s pullbacks were small. The bulls were relentless. That makes a strong bear trend day unlikely.<p>Traders expect today to test yesterday’s high, not form a bear trend day, and be either sideways or have a bullish bias. However, we are at the end of the year, and the year has been incredibly strong. That increases the chance of a strong trend up or down in the remaining days of 2020. It is more likely that the Emini will wait for next year before deciding on the direction of the breakout of the 3-week range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-22.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and Small Pullback Bull Trend.

Yesterday reversed up and became a buy signal bar. Today triggered the buy signal by going above yesterday’s high. However, it did not yet go above Friday’s high, and the EURUSD is therefore still on the sell signal.<p>The sell signal was weak because a small bear doji is usually insufficient to reverse a strong bull trend. Yesterday’s buy signal is also weak. This is because it had a big tail and a small body. That is a big doji, which is typically more of a trading range bar than the start of a bull trend.<p>When there is a weak signal, fewer traders are willing to bet on a trend. Also, the entry is typically weak. That disappoints the traders who took the signal, and they tend to take quick profits. The result is usually a small trading range. Consequently, the EURUSD will probably go more sideways for a couple days than up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off a little overnight, but then reversed up to just above yesterday’s high. This triggered the buy signal on the daily chart. However, the rally barely went above yesterday’s high, and then reversed back down to yesterday’s close and today’s open.<p>While today is a bull reversal day, it is small. Also, the rally turned down from resistance. The reversal down so far is minor, and the reversal up was reasonably strong. That makes it likely that the bulls will test yesterday’s high again. They will therefore probably buy this pullback. However, the bears were able to reverse the market down from just after triggering the daily buy signal. They probably will sell again around yesterday’s high.<p>With sellers above and buyers below, the EURUSD will probably be in a trading range today. Since the daily chart is in a bull trend, and there were reversals up yesterday and today, if there is a trend today, up is more likely. However, the overnight trading has had several small reversals in a relatively small range. Day traders will probably look to scalp for the remainder of the day, unless there is a strong series of bars in either direction.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trading-open-and-then-reveral-up-from-sell-climax-and-ii-into-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading open and then reveral up from sell climax and ii into trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It remained in a trading range all day. The bulls want trend resumption up after yesterday’s strong rally, and they will probably try again tomorrow.<p>The Emini has been in a trading range of 4 weeks. Traders are deciding how the year will end. The bulls want a new high, which would increase the chance of a continued rally into early 2021. The bears want a break below the trading range and then a measured move down to below 3500. Whether or not there is a rally into early January, the Emini will probably sell off to below 3500 starting by early January.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar, but because the Emini is in the middle of a 4-week trading range, there might be more follow-through buying below than sellers above. It is not a reliable setup for stop order traders.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. Traders believe that there is about a 50% chance of the breakout being up or down.<p>Traders are deciding whether December and the year will close on the high. If it does, there would be an increased chance of higher prices in early January. In fact, 2021 could gap above the high of 2020. There would then be a gap up on the yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily charts. The bulls would see that as a sign of strength, and it would make traders more willing to buy at the start of the year.<p>The alternative is for December to close around the open or low of the month. That would disappoint the bulls and make them less willing to buy at these prices. It would increase the chance of lower prices in early January.<p>But even if there is an early January rally, the bars on the daily chart for the past 7 weeks have been remarkably neutral. That makes a pullback to at least 3500 likely to begin either in December or early January.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 11 points in the Globex market. Even though the Emini has been sideways for a month, it is still in a bull trend since the October 30 low. Also, Monday was a strong bull day. Therefore, if there is a trend today, up is more likely. Remember, the bulls have been in control since the March low. They want the year to close on the high of the year. There is at least a 50% chance that it will.<p>Whether or not today is a trend day, most days over the past 7 weeks have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Consequently, day traders will expect at least one reversal today. Also, most days have had a lot of trading range price action, and most have closed either in the middle of the day’s range, like yesterday, or near the open. Day traders will look for a test of either of those prices in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trading-open-and-then-reveral-up-from-sell-climax-and-ii-into-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-23.png\" alt=\"Emini trading open and then reveral up from sell climax and ii into trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Because the rally from the November 4 low has had 3 legs up, a reversal down from here would be from a wedge top.<p>A wedge top reversal could be major. That means it would last at least a few weeks, and have at least a couple clear legs. Also, traders would look for the selloff to test major support, like the September 1 high.<p>Yesterday reversed down a 2nd time from the wedge top. It was a big bear bar closing near its low. It is therefore a 2nd sell signal bar. If today trades below yesterday’s low, it will trigger the Low 2 sell signal.<p>However, unless the bears can create consecutive big bear bars, traders will conclude that the selloff from the December high is minor. That means they expect it to become a bull flag, or a trading range and not a bear trend.<p>If today is a bull bar closing near its high, it would be a 2nd attempt in 3 days to resume the bull trend. Today would then be a High 2 buy signal bar.<p>With mostly sideways trading for all of December, a High 2 buy signal and a Low 2 sell signal are less reliable. Traders see December as a trading range.<p>When a market is in a trading range, traders tend to take quick profits. That results in more sideways trading, instead of a resumption of the bull trend, or a reversal down into a bear trend. So, yes, yesterday is a sell signal bar and today could become a buy signal bar, but neither is a reliable signal. Traders will bet that the trading range will continue indefinitely.<p>Currency markets often break out or reverse around the start of a year. The EURUSD might wait until January before deciding on the direction of its next move.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small trading range so far today. It has held above yesterday’s low and therefore has not yet triggered the Low 2 top sell signal. Day traders have been scalping up and down for 10 pips.<p>The bears want a strong break below yesterday’s low and a bear trend. Since the EURUSD has been in a trading range since early December, a 2nd consecutive big bear day is unlikely.<p>The bulls do not need a big bull day. They simply want today to close near its high. Today would then be a buy signal bar for tomorrow. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p>While day traders have been scalping overnight, they will switch to swing trading if there is a big, sustained move up or down. However, it is more likely that today will remain a trading range day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-weak-rally-then-late-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak rally then late bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Because the trend lacked strong breakouts, it was likely to not last all day.

It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar, but because the Emini is in the middle of a 4-week trading range, there might be more follow-through buying below than sellers above. It is not a reliable setup for stop order traders.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. Traders believe that there is about a 50% chance of the breakout being up or down.<p>Traders are deciding whether December and the year will close on the high. If it does, there would be an increased chance of higher prices in early January. In fact, 2021 could gap above the high of 2020. There would then be a gap up on the yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily charts. The bulls would see that as a sign of strength, and it would make traders more willing to buy at the start of the year.<p>The alternative is for December to close around the open or low of the month. That would disappoint the bulls and make them less willing to buy at these prices. It would increase the chance of lower prices in early January.<p>But even if there is an early January rally, the bars on the daily chart for the past 7 weeks have been remarkably neutral. That makes a pullback to at least 3500 likely to begin either in December or early January.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 11 points in the Globex market. Even though the Emini has been sideways for a month, it is still in a bull trend since the October 30 low. Also, Monday was a strong bull day. Therefore, if there is a trend today, up is more likely. Remember, the bulls have been in control since the March low. They want the year to close on the high of the year. There is at least a 50% chance that it will.<p>Whether or not today is a trend day, most days over the past 7 weeks have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Consequently, day traders will expect at least one reversal today. Also, most days have had a lot of trading range price action, and most have closed either in the middle of the day’s range, like yesterday, or near the open. Day traders will look for a test of either of those prices in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-trading-open-and-then-reveral-up-from-sell-climax-and-ii-into-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-23.png\" alt=\"Emini trading open and then reveral up from sell climax and ii into trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Because the rally from the November 4 low has had 3 legs up, a reversal down from here would be from a wedge top.<p>A wedge top reversal could be major. That means it would last at least a few weeks, and have at least a couple clear legs. Also, traders would look for the selloff to test major support, like the September 1 high.<p>Yesterday reversed down a 2nd time from the wedge top. It was a big bear bar closing near its low. It is therefore a 2nd sell signal bar. If today trades below yesterday’s low, it will trigger the Low 2 sell signal.<p>However, unless the bears can create consecutive big bear bars, traders will conclude that the selloff from the December high is minor. That means they expect it to become a bull flag, or a trading range and not a bear trend.<p>If today is a bull bar closing near its high, it would be a 2nd attempt in 3 days to resume the bull trend. Today would then be a High 2 buy signal bar.<p>With mostly sideways trading for all of December, a High 2 buy signal and a Low 2 sell signal are less reliable. Traders see December as a trading range.<p>When a market is in a trading range, traders tend to take quick profits. That results in more sideways trading, instead of a resumption of the bull trend, or a reversal down into a bear trend. So, yes, yesterday is a sell signal bar and today could become a buy signal bar, but neither is a reliable signal. Traders will bet that the trading range will continue indefinitely.<p>Currency markets often break out or reverse around the start of a year. The EURUSD might wait until January before deciding on the direction of its next move.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small trading range so far today. It has held above yesterday’s low and therefore has not yet triggered the Low 2 top sell signal. Day traders have been scalping up and down for 10 pips.<p>The bears want a strong break below yesterday’s low and a bear trend. Since the EURUSD has been in a trading range since early December, a 2nd consecutive big bear day is unlikely.<p>The bulls do not need a big bull day. They simply want today to close near its high. Today would then be a buy signal bar for tomorrow. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p>While day traders have been scalping overnight, they will switch to swing trading if there is a big, sustained move up or down. However, it is more likely that today will remain a trading range day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-weak-rally-then-late-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak rally then late bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But since it is coming in the middle of a 4-week trading range, it is not strongly bearish. Traders expect reversals every few days. That will change if the bears can get a strong selloff for a couple more days.<p>The bulls want the Emini to close on the high of the year next week, and then gap up on January 4. There would then be a gap up up on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. I do not know if there ever was a gap up on the yearly chart of the S&amp;P. There is currently a 50% chance that the year close on the high, and a 30% chance that there will be a gap up in January, above the 2020 high.<p>However, the Emini is at the top of its December trading range, There is also a 50% chance, that the Emini will end the year 100 points or more down from the high. Whether the year closes on its high or not, traders should expect a reversal down to below 3500 to begin by early January.<p>What is taking place between now and next Thursday is a fight over how the year will close. This is the holiday season, and the daily ranges tend to be smaller. There also is typically more trading range trading on the 5-minute chart.<p>But because we are now near the end of the year, and markets often make big moves near the end of time frames, there is an increased chance of one or two big trend days by the time 2020 trading ends next Thursday.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>There is an early close today. The Emini session ends at 10:15 pm PST.<p>The Emini is up 2 points in the Globex session. When there is an early close, the Emini usually either has only one swing or forms a trading range day. Also, if there is a swing, the day’s range is typically small, because there are 3 fewer hours of trading. Traders will look for a sign of a swing up or down in the 1st hour.<p>Normally when a day ends with a sell climax, traders expect a couple hours of sideways to up trading to begin by the end of the 2nd hour on the next day. That further reduces the chance that today will have a big range.<p>Day traders will look for signs on an early trend. If instead there is an early trading range, many traders will stop trading because there would not be much time remaining for a trend.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-weak-rally-then-late-bear-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-24.png\" alt=\"Emini weak rally then late bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today is therefore a inside day. It is the 2nd consecutive inside day. If it remains an inside day, there will be an ii pattern on the daily chart, which is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>When there is a breakout above an ii late in a bull trend, it typically does not get far before reversing. It usually is the Final Bull Flag.<p>Strong rallies often end with an ii. Therefore, a breakout below today’s low would trigger a credible sell signal. Traders would look for about TBTL (Ten Bars and Two Legs) sideways to down.<p>If today goes above yesterday’s high, or below yesterday’s low, there would be no ii. Since yesterday is a weak buy and sell signal bar, today would probably not go far above or below yesterday. This is especially true with most traders leaving around 10:15 am PST today for the Christmas break. Traders appear to be waiting for Brexit news before deciding on the direction of the next move. This should come by the end of the year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied a little, and then sold off back to near the overnight open. The range is only about 30 pips. Day traders have been scalping for 10 pips.<p>If there is Brexit news, or any other news, today could trend up or down.

But since it is coming in the middle of a 4-week trading range, it is not strongly bearish. Traders expect reversals every few days. That will change if the bears can get a strong selloff for a couple more days.<p>The bulls want the Emini to close on the high of the year next week, and then gap up on January 4. There would then be a gap up up on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. I do not know if there ever was a gap up on the yearly chart of the S&amp;P. There is currently a 50% chance that the year close on the high, and a 30% chance that there will be a gap up in January, above the 2020 high.<p>However, the Emini is at the top of its December trading range, There is also a 50% chance, that the Emini will end the year 100 points or more down from the high. Whether the year closes on its high or not, traders should expect a reversal down to below 3500 to begin by early January.<p>What is taking place between now and next Thursday is a fight over how the year will close. This is the holiday season, and the daily ranges tend to be smaller. There also is typically more trading range trading on the 5-minute chart.<p>But because we are now near the end of the year, and markets often make big moves near the end of time frames, there is an increased chance of one or two big trend days by the time 2020 trading ends next Thursday.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>There is an early close today. The Emini session ends at 10:15 pm PST.<p>The Emini is up 2 points in the Globex session. When there is an early close, the Emini usually either has only one swing or forms a trading range day. Also, if there is a swing, the day’s range is typically small, because there are 3 fewer hours of trading. Traders will look for a sign of a swing up or down in the 1st hour.<p>Normally when a day ends with a sell climax, traders expect a couple hours of sideways to up trading to begin by the end of the 2nd hour on the next day. That further reduces the chance that today will have a big range.<p>Day traders will look for signs on an early trend. If instead there is an early trading range, many traders will stop trading because there would not be much time remaining for a trend.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-weak-rally-then-late-bear-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-24.png\" alt=\"Emini weak rally then late bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today is therefore a inside day. It is the 2nd consecutive inside day. If it remains an inside day, there will be an ii pattern on the daily chart, which is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>When there is a breakout above an ii late in a bull trend, it typically does not get far before reversing. It usually is the Final Bull Flag.<p>Strong rallies often end with an ii. Therefore, a breakout below today’s low would trigger a credible sell signal. Traders would look for about TBTL (Ten Bars and Two Legs) sideways to down.<p>If today goes above yesterday’s high, or below yesterday’s low, there would be no ii. Since yesterday is a weak buy and sell signal bar, today would probably not go far above or below yesterday. This is especially true with most traders leaving around 10:15 am PST today for the Christmas break. Traders appear to be waiting for Brexit news before deciding on the direction of the next move. This should come by the end of the year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied a little, and then sold off back to near the overnight open. The range is only about 30 pips. Day traders have been scalping for 10 pips.<p>If there is Brexit news, or any other news, today could trend up or down. Since it is an ii, it is a sign that traders are expecting a big move on the daily chart to begin soon.

id=\"0-market-overview-weekend-market-analysis\">Market Overview: Weekend Market Analysis</h2><p>The<strong>SP500 Emini</strong>futures are at a measured move target, and there is a nested wedge top on the weekly chart. Also, the 5-week rally on the daily chart has not been very strong. Traders should expect a pullback to below 3500 to begin by early January after a possible 2020 new all-time high.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>on the weekly chart are at the apex of a 10-month triangle, and just above a 2-year bull trend line. They should break up or down by the end of January.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market on the weekly chart has rallied strongly from the March low. However, the rally is in a nested wedge bull channel. That typically results in a bear breakout, and a couple legs down. While the bull trend is still intact, traders should be ready for a possible reversal down in January.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-weekly-chart-at-apex-of-triangle-and-bottom-of-trading-range\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart at apex of triangle and bottom of trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-at-bottom-of-triangle-so-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-26.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart at bottom of triangle so breakout mode\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures bond chart has been sideways since the biggest buy climax in history in March. Until September, all you would hear on TV was that interest rates would go to zero, and gold would reach infinity. Clearly, the pundits were exaggerating, but<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\">I have said many times for 14 months that anyone claiming that we would have negative interest rates is out of touch with the American people</a>. They would never accept it, and it therefore would not happen.<p>March looks like a credible top. If it is not, the final top will not be much above the March high.<p>Finally, since March, I have said that bonds would be sideways in a tight range for the remainder of the year. Why? Because after a strong reversal from an extreme buy climax, a market typically goes sideways for 10 or more bars. It is important to understand that a pattern is often clear on several time frames. Corrections are based on the highest time frame that shows the pattern. That is the monthly chart (not shown). Ten bars on the monthly chart meant the rest of 2020.<h3 id=\"3-is-a-bear-breakout-imminent\">Is a bear breakout imminent?</h3><p>Now the experts have reversed their opinions. They are saying that the dollar will get crushed and it will cause inflation, which will make bonds fall.<p>This conclusion is right, but their timing might not be. I have said many times this year that interest rates will be higher (bonds lower) 5 and 10 years from now. But I keep making the point that the selloff will not be in a straight line. There will be rallies along the way, and the rallies can be strong, and last two to three months.<p>With bonds repeatedly trying to break below the June low and failing, you will get an increasing number of disappointed bears. What will they do? They will buy back their shorts and look to sell again higher. If the market repeatedly tries to do something and fails, it then usually tries the opposite. That means an imminent bear breakout is not nearly as certain as everyone on TV believes.<h3 id=\"4-the-significance-of-the-triangle\">The significance of the triangle</h3><p>While the bond market has sold off since the March high, it has also been sideways in a triangle. It is now at the apex of that triangle, and it has additionally been in a tight trading range for 8 weeks. This is a neutral market. It might continue sideways for another few weeks until it pokes below the 2-year bull trend line, before deciding on the direction of the breakout. But bonds will probably break out up or down, before the end of January.<p>A Breakout Mode market has a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout. Furthermore, the 1st breakout up or down has a 50% chance of reversing. It is a neutral pattern, but one that is likely to break out soon.<h3 id=\"5-weak-buy-signal-\">Weak buy signal</h3><p>This week has a bull body after breaking below an ii pattern (consecutive inside bars). Should you buy next week for a reversal up? The bond futures are still in a tight range and that is a Limit Order Market. There typically are more traders selling above bars, and buying below, than traders entering with stops hoping for a trend. So, no, buying above this week’s high is not a high probability bet.<p>This is particularly true since this week’s candlestick had a small body with prominent tails above and below. That is a neutral bar and not the clear start of a trend.<p>It is better to wait for a stronger buy or sell signal. That can be a strong signal bar after a failed breakout below or above, or it can be from a strong breakout. A strong breakout usually means a couple bars closing far above the bear trend line and closing near theirs highs, or a couple bars closing far below the range and closing near their lows.<h3 id=\"6-what-should-traders-expect-next-week-\">What should traders expect next week?</h3><p>More sideways trading. Markets have inertia, and they tend to continue doing what they have been doing. But with the bond market at the apex of a triangle and just above a 2-year bull trend line, traders are expecting a breakout soon. However, until there is a breakout, there is no breakout.<h2 id=\"7-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"8-eurusd-weekly-chart-has-nested-wedge-top-but-no-reversal-down-yet\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart has nested wedge top but no reversal down yet</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-at-forming-nested-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-26-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart at forming nested wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the weekly chart has been in a bull trend since the March low. However, the rally over the past 8 weeks has had 3 legs up. If there is a reversal down within the next few weeks, traders will see this rally as a wedge top.<p>This 8-week rally is the 3rd leg up in a rally that began in March. Therefore, if there is a reversal down in January, the pattern will be a nested wedge. That has a higher probability of leading to a couple legs down. Traders would look for a test of the bottom of the most recent leg up, which is the November low at around 1.16.<p>Breakout points are magnets, which means that if a reversal down gets near a breakout point, it usually will test it. A test means that the selloff gets very close or even dips below it. The most important breakout point is the March 9 high, just below 1.15. Therefore, if the EURUSD weekly chart reverses down in January, traders should expect the selloff to reach around 1.15. While it could fall further, that will be the focus for most traders.<p>That is far below the current price. If there is a reversal that gets there, the selloff will probably take a least a couple months and have at least a couple legs.<p>Now, why talk about a big reversal when the chart is clearly in a bull trend? Because a bull channel usually has a bear breakout. A bear breakout would also be a reversal down from a nested wedge buy climax.<h3 id=\"9-channels-usually-evolve-into-a-trading-range\">Channels usually evolve into a trading range</h3><p>What happens after a test of the November low? When there is a reversal down from a bull channel, the chart usually evolves into a trading range. Therefore, traders would expect the EURUSD to trade between 1.15 and 1.22 for many months. At some point, the EURUSD would then either resume up to above 1.25 or continue down to the March low at around 1.05.<h3 id=\"10-how-long-can-the-bull-trend-last\">How long can the bull trend last?</h3><p>Trends constantly create tops and then ignore them. They can last much longer and go much further than what appears reasonable.<p>I said that bull channels typically have bear breakouts. Well, about 25% of the time, there is a successful bull breakout and an acceleration up above a bull channel. But that means it is more likely that there will be a bear breakout.<p>If there is an acceleration up, the next target is the February 2018 high just above 1.25. The EURUSD should get there. The question is when. At the moment, it is more likely that there will be a pullback for a few months first.<p>If instead the EURUSD continues strongly up to far above that 1.25 level, the next target is the 2014 high at around 1.40. The February 2018 1.25 high is the neckline of a double bottom created by the January 2017 and March 2020 lows. A measured move up is 1.4770. If this bull trend continues to that target, it will probably take at least a couple years to get there.<h2 id=\"11-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"12-monthly-emini-chart-so-far-has-disappointing-follow-through-after-strong-november\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart so far has disappointing follow-through after strong November</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-futures-candlestick-chart-has-weak-follow-through-after-big-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures chart has weak follow-through after big bull breakout but still possible 2020 new all-time high\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is in a strong bull trend, which makes higher prices likely over the coming year. A new all-time-high is likely for 2020. This month so far is a small bull bar. This is modest follow-through buying after November’s big bar. Traders see a bull follow-through bar as a sign that the market will continue at least a little higher.<p>I think what is going on now is fascinating.<a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sp-500-surge-2021-jpmorgan-2020-12-1029881540#:~:text=%22Our%20base%20case%20S%26P%20500,fuller%20recovery%20is%20priced%20in.\" class=\"rank-math-link\" rel=\"noopener\">JP Morgan says that the S&amp;P will reach 4,600 in 2021.</a>But that does not mean in January. The question is when, and a year is a long time. Remember, this year sold off 35% and it is now closing on the high. With the Emini in a strong bull trend on all time frames, it certainly is possible.<p>The bulls want the monthly chart to close near its high. December closes next Thursday. There are only 4 trading days remaining in 2021. What they do can affect what traders will expect for the 1st many months of 2021.<p>The bulls want the month to close within 20 points of the high. If it does, then they will have a reasonable chance of a gap up to another new all-time high when 2021 trading begins on January 4.<p>But think about this. If there is a gap up on the daily chart to a new high on Monday January 4, 2021, there would also be a gap up to a new high on the weekly, monthly, and yearly charts as well. Gaps on the monthly chart are rare. Although I have not checked, I do not know if there has ever been a gap up to a new all-time high on the monthly S&amp;P or Emini futures charts.<h3 id=\"13-what-happens-if-there-is-a-yearly-gap-up-on-january-4-2021\">What happens if there is a yearly gap up on January 4, 2021?</h3><p>Let’s say that there is a big gap up on January 4 on the daily chart. A big gap on the daily chart would be a small gap on the monthly chart, and a tiny gap on the yearly chart. This is important because small gaps usually close before the end of the bar. Therefore, the yearly gap should close before the end of 2021 when the yearly candlestick closes. But since the gap will be small on the monthly chart, it should close before the monthly bar closes at the end of January. If it stays open, it should close within a month or two afterwards.<p>If the gap is small on the weekly chart, it will probably close by the end of the week, or shortly thereafter. Therefore as dramatic as it would be if there is a gap up to a new all-time high, on January 4, the euphoria should be short-lived because the monthly and yearly gaps would likely soon close.<h3 id=\"14-dont-forget-the-bad-bull-flag\">Don’t forget the bad bull flag</h3><p>The Emini pulled back in October and November. Both months were bear bars. But the pullback was in a bull trend and it was therefore a High 1 bull flag.<p>A bull flag that is composed of 2 bear bars is less likely to lead to a sustained rally. When December traded above the November high, it triggered the High 1 buy signal. However, I have been saying that the resumption of a bull trend, after a bad bull flag and late in a buy climax, typically only lasts a couple bars. December is the 2nd bar. That increases the chance of a pullback in January, whether or not January breaks above the December high.<p>Furthermore, there is an increased chance that the pullback will last longer than the 2 bars in the bull flag. It typically will have at least a couple small legs down. Therefore, if there is a reversal down starting in January, it could take about 5 bars to complete 2 legs down. That means that a reversal down in January could lead to a trading range for the 1st half of 2021.<h3 id=\"15-and-dont-forget-politics\">And don’t forget politics</h3><p>There is unusual acrimony in Washington, and President Trump has done many unexpected things during his 4 years. Traders should be prepared for the possibility of other surprises after January 5. That is the date of the Georgia senate races. If Biden wins both, that could quickly lead to a selloff.<p>Also, President Trump has done many surprising things during his 4 years, and he might do something unexpected after the January 5 election. For example, he and his supporters in Congress might do something disruptive when Congress meets to accept the electoral college votes on January 6.<p>Also, other countries might try to do something in Trump’s final 2 weeks, that they might not be willing to do once Biden becomes president, hoping that Trump will give them political cover. And then there are all of the unimaginable Black Swan events that can happen at any time.<h2 id=\"16-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-high-1-bull-flag-but-might-form-nested-wedge-top-soon\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has High 1 bull flag, but might form nested wedge top soon</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-follow-through-after-big-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-26-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has weak follow-through after big bull breakout and possible nested wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied strongly since the October low. This week pulled back, but it was a bull bar closing near its high. It is a High 1 bull flag for next week. As I wrote above, the Emini will probably trade at least a little higher next week. The bulls want it to trade a lot higher, and it might to a new all-time high.<p>Traders should note that, while the weekly chart is rallying, the bars since the September 2 high are also consistent with the market being in a trading range since that high. Therefore, if there is a reversal down in January, traders will begin to wonder if the selloff will reach the October low in the first quarter. That would then be a bear leg in the trading range.<h3 id=\"17-testing-a-measured-move-target\">Testing a measured move target</h3><p>Note that the Emini is at a measured move target. The June 15 low tested the April 29 high, but did not dip below it. The Emini tested that breakout point again 2 week later and reversed up strongly. That tells us that traders consider the April 29 high is very important.<p>The pandemic low is also very important. Two very important prices often generate a 3rd important price at a measured move away. The measured move target is 3686. While the all-time high is now about 1% above the target, if there is a reversal down from this area, it will in part be due to the measured move.<p>Many computers will probably take profits around here. If enough do, the Emini will pull back. If instead the Emini just keeps working higher, then traders will conclude that the target turned out to be insignificant.<h2 id=\"18-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-is-late-in-bull-channel-so-reversal-down-to-3500-likely-soon\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is late in bull channel so reversal down to 3500 likely soon</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-in-bull-channel-but-wedge-reversal-likely-soon.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-26-4.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel but wedge top soon, after possible new all-time high\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been rallying in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since the November 10 pullback. A Small Pullback Bull Trend can continue to 50 or more bars if it is strong. One sign of strength is at least a couple sets of two or three big bull bars closing near their highs. This 2-month rally does not have even one. When a Small Pullback Bull Trend lacks those strong breakouts, it usually begins to turn sideways to down before 50 bars. The rally in the Emini is getting close to that duration.<p>Also, look at the bars since late October. About 75% of them closed either near the open, or in the middle of the bar. This lack of strong bull bars is more common when a rally is a leg in a trading range. A bull leg in a trading range usually leads to a bear leg, and a test of the bottom of the range. The bottom of the range is usually the start of the bull channel, which is the November 10 low just below 3500. However, it could be all of the way down to the October low, if that is the bottom of the range.<p>A bull channel usually begins to turn down after 3 legs up. This rally had minor reversals on November 16, December 9, and December 17. It therefore has met the minimum objective.<p>This week’s strong reversal up will probably result in one more new all-time high. If there is a reversal at that point, there will be a bigger wedge pattern where the 1st leg ended on November 9 and the 2nd leg ended on either December 9 or December 17.<h3 id=\"19-the-emini-is-still-in-a-bull-trend\">The Emini is still in a bull trend</h3><p>It is important to see that the Emini is still in a bull trend. A bull trend can continue much longer that what appears reasonable. However, because of the factors that I discussed, I think that the Emini will probably not go much higher before it tests down to 3500. There is a 60% chance of a pullback to 3500 before the Emini reaches 4000, and probably by the end of January.<p>But, it is important to see that there is no clear top yet. That is why I say that the odds are that the Emini will go at least a little higher before reversing down. And because it is in a bull trend on all time frames, it could just keep going up rather than having the likely pullback.<h2 id=\"20-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Today is a High 1 buy signal bar in a Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>On the weekly chart, last week is also a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar in a strong bull trend. This week should trigger both buy signals.<p>The bulls want the year to close on its high when it ends on Thursday. They then want January 4, the 1st trading day of 2021, to gap above this year’s high. There would then be a gap up to a new all-time high on the yearly chart, which might not have ever happened before in the stock market.<p>The bears want a selloff to 3500 to begin this week, but they might have to wait until after January 6. At the moment, the Emini is rallying strongly enough to go at least a little higher.<p>The week before Christmas and New Year’s normally has the quietest trading of the year. That increases the chance of a lot of time in very tight trading ranges.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 27 points in the Globex session. Today will therefore have a big gap up, and it might gap to a new all-time high.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the 20-bar EMA. Many traders do not like to pay far above the average price. The result usually is an early trading range. The bulls want to buy either a double bottom, or wedge bottom near the EMA, which is one measure of the average price.<p>The bears will look to sell an early rally to a wedge top or double top, betting on a move down to the EMA. In either case, the Emini typically forms a 1- to 2-hour trading range on the open, until it gets near the EMA. Traders then decide if there will be a trend up or down.<p>When there is a big gap, there is an increased chance of a trend. If there is a trend, up is slightly more likely. But there is only a 25% chance of a trend from the open.<p>Also, if there is a trading range open, which is likely, and then a trend, the trend would be coming after a trading range. When a trend comes from a neutral market, it tends to be weaker and not last until the close. Therefore, unless there is a strong trend on the open, the Emini will probably spend a lot of time going sideways today, even if there is a 3-hour swing up or down.<h2>Previous day’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-after-sell-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-28.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal after sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from before the holiday.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EURUSD-Forex-nested-wedge-top-buy-climax-but-need-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-28-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex nested wedge top buy climax but need bear breakout\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is still in a Small Pullback Bull Trend, and the February 2018 high above 1.25 is the next target. However, the bull channel in December has had 3 legs up, and it is the 3rd leg up from the November 4 low. This is a nested wedge, and it increases the chance of at least a couple legs down to below the December 9 low, beginning within the next 2 weeks. Reversals have an increased chance of coming at the start of a year in Forex markets.<p>While Friday was a reversal day, it had a bull body. Also, there is a 6-day tight trading range. This is not a strong sell setup. If there is a reversal down this week, it will probably be minor. That means it would probably last 2 or 3 weeks and end at support, like the December 9 high, or the September 1 high. But until there is a big bear day breaking below the 3-week bull channel, traders will expect sideways to up trading.<p>It is important to note that most of the days in December had prominent tails. This is 2-sided trading and a sign that the rally is losing momentum. It increases the chance of a reversal down soon. But until there is a strong reversal, the odds continue to favor at least higher prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied and sold off overnight. It is within Friday’s range and still in a 6-day tight trading range.<p>If it remains an inside day, which it probably will, there will be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern on the daily chart because Friday was an outside day. This and last week’s ii (inside-inside) pattern are Breakout Mode Patterns, which means the probability of a bear breakout is about the same as for a bull breakout. That is another reason for traders to look for a reversal down within the next couple weeks.<p>The final week of the year tends to be quiet. Also, this is the 6th day in a tight trading range. Day traders have been looking for reversals and taking quick profits.

Today is a High 1 buy signal bar in a Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>On the weekly chart, last week is also a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar in a strong bull trend. This week should trigger both buy signals.<p>The bulls want the year to close on its high when it ends on Thursday. They then want January 4, the 1st trading day of 2021, to gap above this year’s high. There would then be a gap up to a new all-time high on the yearly chart, which might not have ever happened before in the stock market.<p>The bears want a selloff to 3500 to begin this week, but they might have to wait until after January 6. At the moment, the Emini is rallying strongly enough to go at least a little higher.<p>The week before Christmas and New Year’s normally has the quietest trading of the year. That increases the chance of a lot of time in very tight trading ranges.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 27 points in the Globex session. Today will therefore have a big gap up, and it might gap to a new all-time high.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the 20-bar EMA. Many traders do not like to pay far above the average price. The result usually is an early trading range. The bulls want to buy either a double bottom, or wedge bottom near the EMA, which is one measure of the average price.<p>The bears will look to sell an early rally to a wedge top or double top, betting on a move down to the EMA. In either case, the Emini typically forms a 1- to 2-hour trading range on the open, until it gets near the EMA. Traders then decide if there will be a trend up or down.<p>When there is a big gap, there is an increased chance of a trend. If there is a trend, up is slightly more likely. But there is only a 25% chance of a trend from the open.<p>Also, if there is a trading range open, which is likely, and then a trend, the trend would be coming after a trading range. When a trend comes from a neutral market, it tends to be weaker and not last until the close. Therefore, unless there is a strong trend on the open, the Emini will probably spend a lot of time going sideways today, even if there is a 3-hour swing up or down.<h2>Previous day’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-after-sell-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-28.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal after sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from before the holiday.

However, the bull channel in December has had 3 legs up, and it is the 3rd leg up from the November 4 low. This is a nested wedge, and it increases the chance of at least a couple legs down to below the December 9 low, beginning within the next 2 weeks. Reversals have an increased chance of coming at the start of a year in Forex markets.<p>While Friday was a reversal day, it had a bull body. Also, there is a 6-day tight trading range. This is not a strong sell setup. If there is a reversal down this week, it will probably be minor. That means it would probably last 2 or 3 weeks and end at support, like the December 9 high, or the September 1 high. But until there is a big bear day breaking below the 3-week bull channel, traders will expect sideways to up trading.<p>It is important to note that most of the days in December had prominent tails. This is 2-sided trading and a sign that the rally is losing momentum. It increases the chance of a reversal down soon. But until there is a strong reversal, the odds continue to favor at least higher prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied and sold off overnight. It is within Friday’s range and still in a 6-day tight trading range.<p>If it remains an inside day, which it probably will, there will be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern on the daily chart because Friday was an outside day. This and last week’s ii (inside-inside) pattern are Breakout Mode Patterns, which means the probability of a bear breakout is about the same as for a bull breakout. That is another reason for traders to look for a reversal down within the next couple weeks.<p>The final week of the year tends to be quiet. Also, this is the 6th day in a tight trading range. Day traders have been looking for reversals and taking quick profits. But because the daily chart is in Breakout Mode, they will switch to swing trading if there is a series of big trend bars in either direction.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-spike-and-channel-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It triggered High 1 buy signals on the daily and weekly charts. Since yesterday was a bull day, there is an increased chance of higher prices today.<p>There are 3 trading days remaining in 2020. The year will probably close near its high, and possibly at the high. The bulls want 2021 to gap up on Monday to a new all-time high on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. Whether or not it does, December so far is strong enough to make it likely that January will go at least a little higher.<p>The bears want a 100-point end-of-the year selloff. That would reduce the chances of higher prices in January. However, they only have 3 days left, and the Emini just triggered buy signals on the daily and weekly charts. It is more likely that the Emini will go sideways to up and try to close the year on the high.<p>But, markets often make big moves just before a bar closes. At the moment, the bears have only a 30% chance of a big selloff this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap up to a new all-time high again today. Because the bulls have been strong, they will probably be able to prevent a big bear trend day today. But with this being the quietest week of the year, and yesterday being sideways for most of the day, there is an increased chance of mostly sideways trading again today.<p>There are only 3 trading days left to the month and year. When a bar is about to close, here on the monthly and yearly charts, and the bar is at the high, there is an increased chance of a selloff.<p>Most bull candlesticks have noticeable tails on top. They usually form just before the bar closes. For a tail to be noticeable on the monthly and yearly charts, the Emini would probably have to be at least 50 to 100 points down from the high. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a pullback ahead of Thursday’s close when the month and year end.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-spike-and-channel-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-29.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bull trend with Emini all-time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It has also been in a tight trading range for 2 weeks, and Friday was a big reversal day. That means there is some loss of momentum.<p>Also, because there is a nested wedge bull channel, there is an increased risk of a selloff lasting 2 to 3 weeks. But until there is a clear top and a strong reversal down, traders will continue to buy. The next target for the bulls is the February 2018 high just above 1.25.<p>Yesterday was a bull inside day in a bull trend, and it is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. But it had a big tail on top, like many of the bars for the past several weeks. That makes it a weak buy signal. It increases the chance of sellers above its high, and then a continuation of the 2 weeks of sideways trading.<p>It is important to remember that Forex markets have an increased chance of big moves at the start of a year. While the bears want a reversal down from the nested wedge, the bulls want a breakout above the bull channel and an acceleration up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight, but it has been mostly sideways for several hours.

It triggered High 1 buy signals on the daily and weekly charts. Since yesterday was a bull day, there is an increased chance of higher prices today.<p>There are 3 trading days remaining in 2020. The year will probably close near its high, and possibly at the high. The bulls want 2021 to gap up on Monday to a new all-time high on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. Whether or not it does, December so far is strong enough to make it likely that January will go at least a little higher.<p>The bears want a 100-point end-of-the year selloff. That would reduce the chances of higher prices in January. However, they only have 3 days left, and the Emini just triggered buy signals on the daily and weekly charts. It is more likely that the Emini will go sideways to up and try to close the year on the high.<p>But, markets often make big moves just before a bar closes. At the moment, the bears have only a 30% chance of a big selloff this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap up to a new all-time high again today. Because the bulls have been strong, they will probably be able to prevent a big bear trend day today. But with this being the quietest week of the year, and yesterday being sideways for most of the day, there is an increased chance of mostly sideways trading again today.<p>There are only 3 trading days left to the month and year. When a bar is about to close, here on the monthly and yearly charts, and the bar is at the high, there is an increased chance of a selloff.<p>Most bull candlesticks have noticeable tails on top. They usually form just before the bar closes. For a tail to be noticeable on the monthly and yearly charts, the Emini would probably have to be at least 50 to 100 points down from the high. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a pullback ahead of Thursday’s close when the month and year end.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-spike-and-channel-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-29.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bull trend with Emini all-time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It has also been in a tight trading range for 2 weeks, and Friday was a big reversal day. That means there is some loss of momentum.<p>Also, because there is a nested wedge bull channel, there is an increased risk of a selloff lasting 2 to 3 weeks. But until there is a clear top and a strong reversal down, traders will continue to buy. The next target for the bulls is the February 2018 high just above 1.25.<p>Yesterday was a bull inside day in a bull trend, and it is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. But it had a big tail on top, like many of the bars for the past several weeks. That makes it a weak buy signal.

If today trades below yesterday’s low, it will trigger a sell signal. That would increase the chance of at least an Emini bears reversal down (minor) into the end of the year.<p>However, the daily chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since November 10. Every reversal down became a bull flag within a couple days. The bulls are hoping that any selloff will be like all of the others for more than a month.<p>What is different now is that the candlesticks on the monthly and yearly charts close on Thursday. There is an increased chance of a minor reversal just before a bar on any timeframe closes. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a 50- to 100-point pullback by tomorrow’s close.<p>Increased chance does not mean high probability. It is still more likely that 2020 will close within 50 points of the all-time high. If it closes within 20 points, the bulls will try to get Monday to gap up. There would then be a gap up on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. That would be a sign of strength, and it would make traders more confident about buying at the high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably open in the middle of yesterday’s range. Since yesterday had a big range, there is an increased chance that today will stay within yesterday’s range.<p>Yesterday was an outside bar on the daily chart. If today is an inside day, there would be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern on the daily chart going into the final day of the year. Traders are deciding if the year will close on the high, or if there will be a 50-point reversal down. It looks like they might wait for the final trading day of the year to decide.<p>Most days over the past 2 months have had a lot of trading range trading, and at least one swing up and one swing down. With today opening in the middle of yesterday’s range, yesterday having a lot of trading range trading, and this being a holiday week, there is an increased chance of more trading range price action again today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-down-and-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-30.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down and bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

All bull trends repeatedly form wedge tops, but most tops fail and become bull flags. There have been many minor reversals over the past 2 months. Each lasted only 1 to 3 days. Until the bears get a strong sell signal bar and a strong reversal down, the bulls will continue to buy 1 to 3-day reversals.<p>The bears tried to get a reversal down 3 days ago, but they were unable to get a bear body. The past 3 days have had decent bull bodies. Traders are continuing to bet on higher prices.<p>The bulls want a break above last week’s high, a test of the top of the bull channel at around 1.24, and a test of the measured move target at 1.2409. The rally ultimately will reach the February 2018 high, but there will likely be at least one pullback lasting several weeks before the EURUSD gets there. There is an increased chance of reversals in Forex markets in early January.<p>This rally might be too strong. It has lasted about 50 bars. That usually attracts profit takers. Once the bulls take profits, there will probably be a couple legs down over a few weeks. The 1st target is the start of the bull channel, which is the December 9 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly in the overnight session to last week’s high, sold off strongly from that high, and then had a weaker rally back up to last week’s high.<p>While the day is near the high of the session, it is a trading range day. Day traders have been selling and buying for 10- to 20-pip scalps.<p>Because of the strong reversal up from the strong overnight selloff, day traders are more interested in buying. That reversal up significantly reduces the chance of a bear trend day. However, the sharp overnight selloff reduces the chances of a strong rally from here. If the EURUSD is not going to a new low, and it is not going far above the overnight high, day traders will look for reversals.<p>The bulls want today to close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of the year closing at the high.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-weak-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a late bear breakout down to the open of the week and the 60 minute EMA, and then a lower trading range.<p>Today was an inside day on the daily chart. Since yesterday was an outside day, there is now an ioi Breakout Mode pattern. Traders are deciding if the year will close within 20 points of the high or 50 points below the high. If tomorrow gaps down, there would be a 3-day island top. If tomorrow is a big bear trend day, whether or not there is an island top, it would increase the chance that the Emini has begun a reversal down to 3500.<p>Tomorrow is also the last day of the week. The open of the week could be a magnet at the end of the day.<p>It is also the last day of the month, but the only monthly magnet is the open of the month.

If today trades below yesterday’s low, it will trigger a sell signal. That would increase the chance of at least an Emini bears reversal down (minor) into the end of the year.<p>However, the daily chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since November 10. Every reversal down became a bull flag within a couple days. The bulls are hoping that any selloff will be like all of the others for more than a month.<p>What is different now is that the candlesticks on the monthly and yearly charts close on Thursday. There is an increased chance of a minor reversal just before a bar on any timeframe closes. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a 50- to 100-point pullback by tomorrow’s close.<p>Increased chance does not mean high probability. It is still more likely that 2020 will close within 50 points of the all-time high. If it closes within 20 points, the bulls will try to get Monday to gap up. There would then be a gap up on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. That would be a sign of strength, and it would make traders more confident about buying at the high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably open in the middle of yesterday’s range. Since yesterday had a big range, there is an increased chance that today will stay within yesterday’s range.<p>Yesterday was an outside bar on the daily chart. If today is an inside day, there would be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern on the daily chart going into the final day of the year.

That would increase the chance of a gap up on Monday, which would create a gap up to a new all-time high on the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly charts. I suspect that has never happened before, but I did not check.<p>The bears want today to trade below yesterday’s low to trigger the daily sell signal. If today gaps down, there will be a 3-day island top. The bears want the year to close at least 50 points down from the high. That is what is needed to create a conspicuous tail on the monthly and yearly candlesticks. If they get it, it would increase the chance of a reversal down to 3500 in January.<p>At a minimum, the bears want the week to close below the open, which was a magnet for the final 2 hours yesterday. They would prefer December to close below the open of the month, but the open might be too far below.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 2 points in the Globex session. However, it is just above yesterday’s low, and today therefore still might gap down on the daily chart. If there is a gap down, it will likely be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour and are insignificant.<p>The bears want today to trade below yesterday’s low, which would trigger the sell signal. They then want a big bear day.<p>While there is an increased chance, given the IOI and the importance of the final trading day of the year, big trend days come only about 20% of the time. It is still more likely that today will be like most recent days, and spend a lot of time going sideways. Traders might be waiting for the US Georgia election on January 5, before deciding on the direction of the next move on the daily chart.<p>It is important to remember that the bulls want the year to close on its high. This is true even if today trades below yesterday’s low in the 1st hour. There is an increased chance of a trend day, in either direction, on the final day of the year and with an IOI Breakout Mode Pattern.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-weak-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-31.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bear channel and ioi breakout mode\n\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, there have been 3 pushes up from the December 1 low. That wedge is nested within a bigger wedge that began on November 4. A nested wedge usually attracts profit-taking. Therefore, traders should expect a 2-week pullback to begin within the next couple weeks. However, it is important to note that a wedge rally often has a 4th leg up before there is a reversal. Also, when there is a bull channel, there is a 25% chance of a breakout above the channel, and an acceleration up into an even stronger trend.<p>A Small Pullback Bull Trend is strong. A strong bull trend typically has to transition into a trading range before reversing into a bear trend. Consequently, even if there is a strong reversal down in January, it will probably only lead to a trading range and not a bear trend.<p>Today so far is a bear inside day. It is therefore a potential sell signal bar. But it is coming after 6 consecutive bull bars, and it has a prominent tail below. It is therefore a lower probability sell setup. The bears will need either a big reversal down over the next couple days, or a micro double top to make traders think that profit taking is underway. Remember, there is an increased chance of Forex reversals at the start of a year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market tested yesterday’s high and then sold off. But the selloff have several big bounces on the way down. That is trading range behavior. Also, it reversed up strongly from just above yesterday’s low, and is now back to the middle of the day’s range.<p>Day traders have been buying and selling for small scalps. While the reversal up over the past hour has been strong, it will probably not continue up to above yesterday’s high. Therefore, day traders will continue to expect today to be an inside day and a trading range day.<p>The bulls want a 7th consecutive bull day. They also want the year to close on its high, which means above yesterday’s high. But 7 consecutive bull days is unusual. Also, the open is near the high of the day. While it is a magnet, today will more likely begin to go sideways within an hour, in a 30-pip range with the open being at the top of the range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emini-outside-up-day-and-all-time-high-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-12-31-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.
