An Emini strong reversal up from January selloff.<li>While the market might be always-in long, traders may still see this rally from the January 24 low as minor.<li>The market is at important resistance levels: 4500 round number, December lows, and the midpoint of the January selloff (4510.50). These resistance levels increase the odds that the market may go more sideways.<li>The past two bars on the daily chart are a surprise and probably strong enough for at least a second leg up.<li>Some traders will view yesterday as a bull breakout of a bear flag that started after the January 24 low. Those traders will expect a measured move up to the 4600 area.<li>On the daily chart, the past two trading days will make bears less eager to short a 50% pullback of the January selloff (4510.5) for a swing trade. Those bears will likely wait for a second leg up and see if the bears can get a strong sell signal bar.<li>As strong as the past two days appear, it is important to remember that the market is likely in a trading range, and the 4500 price level is around the middle of the trading range. The middle of any trading range is usually a bad area to buy or sell.<li>Bulls hope this is the start of a bull breakout that leads to a test of the all-time highs.<li>Bears see the past two days as a vacuum test of resistance 4500 big round number and will look to sell a lower high major trend reversal.<li>The bears will probably need a micro double top below to get a credible major trend reversal setup.<li>The past two bull bars are strong enough that most bears will want to step aside and see how strong the bulls are before selling.<li>Monday is a give-up bar, which means the market should have at least a second leg up before the bears can get a credible short. Traders will pay close attention to see how much conviction the bulls have at this price level.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 16 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>The Emini has gone sideways in a trading range during the overnight session.<li>As of this moment, the market will probably open around yesterday’s close.<li>The market is likely to have a trading range open today.<li>Most traders should wait for a clear breakout or wait for a credible stop entry swing trade. This could come in the form of a double bottom or double top, a wedge bottom, or a wedge top.<li>Traders are likely to pay close attention to the open of the day today, and it will likely be a magnet all day.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Emini-spike-and-channel-bull-trend-from-the-open-with-bear-trap-and-failed-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-1.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bull trend from the open with bear trap and failed wedge top.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.

Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-Feb-1-2022.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-1-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Daily Chart - Bulls want follow-through today\"></a></figure><ul><li>The bears are failing to hold below the two-month trading range.<li>Bulls and bears both saw the bear breakout last week as a breakout below a final flag.

But the V-bottom rally might stall soon.<li>The January selloff was also a test of the 200-day MA and the bottom of a bull channel on the weekly chart. The bottom of the channel is a line that is parallel to the top of the channel and then attached at the March 3, 2020 pandemic low.<li>Last week, I said that there would be a rally lasting at least a couple weeks and going above the December 3 low. That was the most important breakout point on the way down. When the market is in a trading range, there is usually a pullback beyond breakout points.<li>Traders are deciding if the rally will continue up to a new high without more than a 3-day pullback (V-bottom, like December 2018 and the pandemic bottoms), or if there will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down.<li>The rally is strong enough to continue up in a V-bottom reversal.<li>However, there are 2 problems with this. First, the Emini is still in a trading range, and most legs up and down disappoint traders expecting a trend. Most strong legs reverse.<li>Next, the January selloff was unusually strong. That makes at least a small second leg sideways or down likely.<li>However, if there are several more big bull days over the next couple of weeks, the odds will favor a V-bottom reversal up to a new high.<li>Remember, I have been saying that the Emini should sell off early in 2022 and then rally to a new high later in the year. That is still true, but the new high could come within a couple months if the rally continues up.<li>On the monthly chart, there are now consecutive OO patterns in a bull trend. Also, January closed below its midpoint. These factors increase the chance of a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down, possibly to the 20-month EMA and the 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>With January closing in the middle of its huge range, there is an increased chance February will be an inside bar on the monthly chart. It might even have a bull body.<li>Unless February is a big bull bar, traders should expect a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down, like in the 2018 October to December pullback.<li>What about a crash? Crashes are rare so don’t worry about them.<li>The best the bears will probably get is a test below the 4,000 Big Round Number this year. That would be about a 20% correction.<li>They currently have a 50% chance, but the odds will drop quickly if the rally continues up for another week or two.<li>3 consecutive bull bars is becoming extreme. Also, the Emini is back to the 20-day EMA and a 50% retracement of the January collapse. These factors increase the chance of some profit taking and 2 to 3 days sideways to slightly down trading starting soon.<li>The bears want a resumption of the bear trend.<li>If Russia invades the Ukraine, there will probably be a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down. But they won’t consider invading until late February, after the Winter Olympics. Otherwise, they will lose China’s political support.<li>The concern over the invasion is an overhang that should prevent the rally going straight up to a new high during the Olympics.<li>However, the reversal up is strong and there is no sign of it pausing. Traders are betting on at least slightly higher prices.<li>Since there are now 3 consecutive bull days and the daily chart is still in a trading range, there will probably be a 2- or 3-day pause or pullback soon. The Emini might even go sideways until after the Olympics. At the moment, odds favor at least a little higher.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 28 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Today is the 4<sup>th</sup>day in the bull trend reversal. Traders have been buying aggressively and they might buy more again today.<li>However, the daily chart is still in a trading range, and a 4<sup>th</sup>big bull day would be fairly climactic. The bulls will probably take profits within a few days. That should result in a few sideways to down days.<li>Yesterday was in a tight trading range for most of the day. It came 3 days into a rally, which is late. It therefore might be the Final Bull Flag, and it is therefore a magnet below.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-opening-reversal-then-trading-range-with-late-bull-breakout-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge opening reversal then trading range with late bull breakout.

That follow-through increases the chance of at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up.<li>The bears are hoping the this week’s bounce will form another lower high in the yearlong bear channel.<li>The bulls want the reversal up to be the start of a bull trend lasting several months.<li>But they will need many more bull trend bars and a strong break above the January 14 lower high before traders will believe that a significant bottom is in. Until then traders will continue to bet on new lows.<li>Part of the reason behind the selloff from the January 14 lower high is the fear that Russia will invade the Ukraine. But as I wrote above, Russia will not consider invading until after the Olympics, which means late February.<li>This takes pressure off for a couple weeks, which should slow the selling, or result in a return to the middle of the 9-month trading range.<li>Since there is still uncertainty about the invasion, the EURUSD will probably be mostly sideways for a few weeks.<li>The yearlong selloff on the monthly chart has not been as strong as the 2020 rally. It is more likely a pullback from that rally and not a resumption of the 14-year bear trend. Therefore, the bulls should get a rally lasting several months starting within a few months.<li>Is this the start? The bulls need a strong breakout above a major lower high, like the January 14 high, before traders will conclude that the daily chart has begun a bull trend.<li>At the moment, the bear trend has paused for several months.

That follow-through increases the chance of at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up.<li>The bears are hoping the this week’s bounce will form another lower high in the yearlong bear channel.<li>The bulls want the reversal up to be the start of a bull trend lasting several months.<li>But they will need many more bull trend bars and a strong break above the January 14 lower high before traders will believe that a significant bottom is in. Until then traders will continue to bet on new lows.<li>Part of the reason behind the selloff from the January 14 lower high is the fear that Russia will invade the Ukraine. But as I wrote above, Russia will not consider invading until after the Olympics, which means late February.<li>This takes pressure off for a couple weeks, which should slow the selling, or result in a return to the middle of the 9-month trading range.<li>Since there is still uncertainty about the invasion, the EURUSD will probably be mostly sideways for a few weeks.<li>The yearlong selloff on the monthly chart has not been as strong as the 2020 rally. It is more likely a pullback from that rally and not a resumption of the 14-year bear trend. Therefore, the bulls should get a rally lasting several months starting within a few months.<li>Is this the start? The bulls need a strong breakout above a major lower high, like the January 14 high, before traders will conclude that the daily chart has begun a bull trend.<li>At the moment, the bear trend has paused for several months.

But Emini bulls disappointment still likely.<li>As Al has been saying, this rally is currently a V-bottom. V-bottoms happened on the October – December 2018 crash and the pandemic crash. Traders are wondering if this rally will continue to a new high without needing more than a 3-day pullback.<li>So far, this V-bottom is likely to go higher even if there is a 3-day pullback.<li>On Monday, the bulls tested the December breakout point and continued above it for two consecutive days, furthering the chances of more up.<li>Traders are currently deciding, will this rally be a V-bottom that reaches the January all-time high, or will the market get a second leg down from the selloff in January.<li>The odds are slightly higher that we will continue up at least a little after the four consecutive bull days, however as Al has stated in yesterday’s blog, the bulls have two problems with this rally. One is that the Emini has been in a trading range for the past 6 months, which means the bull will likely become disappointed by the rally soon. Next is that the January selloff is unusually strong, which makes a second leg down likely. Even if the second leg down is small and tests the January lows, that would satisfy the requirement.<li>If the bulls continue to get more bull closes on the daily chart, this will increase the odds of the V-bottom being successful and lower the probability of a second leg down.<li>Since last Friday, it is important to notice that the bull bodies have been getting smaller, which is a sign of momentum loss by the bulls. This increases the odds of 2-3 days sideways to down.<li>Traders will pay close attention over the next couple of days to see what kind of pullback the rally from the January lows will have. If it only has a 2-3 day pullback and reverses up, the odds are the market will go at least a little higher. However, if the bears can keep the market sideways around this current price level, the odds will increase that they will get their second leg down.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 36 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>The Emini has been sideways to down since yesterday’s close.<li>The odds are today will close around the open. This is due to the bulls having four consecutive bull days in a trading range, and the bull bodies are getting smaller, which is a sign of momentum decreasing.<li>Traders should expect a trading range open and pay close attention to the open of the day since today’s odds will close below the open or at the very least close around the opening price.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-then-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-3.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and then wedge top.

Emini V-bottom rally stalling.<li>That zone is the middle of the 6-month trading range at around a 50% retracement of the January selloff.<li>Also, it is testing the January 10 low, which is the highest of the 3 breakout points in the selloff.<li>I also have been saying that a bottom after a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down is more likely than a V-bottom since a V-bottom is uncommon.<li>If there is going to be a V-bottom, the bulls need to prevent this selloff from falling much further and from lasting more than a few days.<li>Yesterday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar after a strong rally, but it had a bear body. However, today’s unemployment report is more important and there is an increased chance of an early trend today.<li>If the Emini falls back below the top of last week’s tight trading range and then rallies strongly, it could still lead to a bull trend, but the bottom would be a higher low major trend reversal and not a V-bottom.<li>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want the week to be a big bull bar closing on its high. It would then be a strong entry bar after last week’s double bottom reversal. That would make higher prices likely next week.<li>At a minimum, the bulls want a bull body, preferably closing above its midpoint and above the December low. Traders would then look for sideways to up trading next week.<li>If this week is a bear bar closing on its low, it would be a Low 1 sell signal bar on the weekly chart for next week. Traders would expect lower prices.<li>There are back-to-back OO patterns on the monthly chart (consecutive outside bars). That is a 2<sup>nd</sup>attempt to reverse down late in a bull trend, which has a higher probability. January was a bear bar that closed below its midpoint, which further increases the chance of lower prices over the next couple months.<li>The Emini should fall below the January low in February or March, which would trigger the monthly OO sell signal.<li>But because the monthly bull trend has been strong, the reversal down should only last 2 to 3 months.<li>The odds favor a new high before a bear trend reversal on the monthly chart.<li>However, a 3-month selloff might lead to a trading range, which could last a year or more. But even if it lasts a long time, traders should expect at least one more new high before there is more than about a 20% selloff.<li>There is a 50% chance that the current reversal down will continue to below 4,000 within a few months.<li>There is only a 30% chance that it will test the pre-pandemic high, which is the February 2020 high, just above 3,300. That is the most important breakout point of the 2-year rally.<li>Last week, I created a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bEmPP9N7tk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">video in which I discuss what the next few years might be like</a>.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 20 points in the overnight Globex session just after the unemployment report.<li>The bulls are hoping this is just a test of yesterday’s low and that today will reverse up from a double bottom.<li>The bears hope today will be a bear trend that again breaks below the October low and continues down to the pre-pandemic high over the next few weeks.<li>What will happen? Traders need more information, which means more bars.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down on the open, today will probably be a trend day.<li>However, Big Down in January and Big Up in February creates Big Confusion. It makes traders less willing to press bets in either direction and it increases the chance of the market going sideways for two or three days. When a market is sideways, it typically has swings in both directions, which means a lot of trading range trading.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-bear-flag-at-EMA-and-bear-channel-but-late-bull-trend-reversal-ahead-of-tomorrows-unemployment-report-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-4.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bear flag at EMA and bear channel but late bull trend reversal ahead of unemployment report.

This is because a tight trading range late in a bear trend is typically the Final Bear Flag.<li>Additionally, I have been saying that the rally should last at least a couple months.<li>Targets above are the January 14 lower high, and then breakout points on the day day. These include the October 12 low, the November 4, 2020 low, and the March 2021 low.<li>Another target is a 50% retracement of the 2021 bear trend.<li>Will this rally reach all of the targets? Maybe 50-50 right now.<li>But if next week is a bull bar on the weekly chart closing on its high, there would be a 60% chance of a breakout above the November 2020 low. That was the bottom of a yearlong trading range within the 7-year trading range. When a market reverses in a trading range, it usually goes beyond breakout points.<li>Can the bears create a double top bear flag with the January 14 high? Today’s high so far is a fraction of a pip above that high, and today currently is near the low of the day.<li>They will try, but the rally has been strong enough so traders will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down. Therefore, the bears will need at least a reversal down from a micro double top next week before they would have a 50% chance of a reversal down to below the January low.<li>What if Russia invades the Ukraine? It would hurt Europe and probably the EURUSD, but it would also hurt the US and possibly the dollar. It is too early to tell what the EURUSD will do.<li>There is only a small chance of Putin invading while the Winter Olympics are going on. Putin cannot risk alienating Xi.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-almost-outside-up-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and small pullback bull trend and almost outside up day\"></a></figure><p><em>Al created the SP500 Emini charts.</em><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Today sold off from a wedge at the EMA, but reversed up from a wedge at just below the January 26 high.<li>The rally continued in a Small Pullback Bull Trend to above the 60-minute EMA and yesterday’s close.<li>The Emini reversed down into the close from a measured move target that was just below yesterday’s high, forming an Almost Outside Up Day.<li>Today is a High Buy signal bar on the daily chart, but because of the small bull body, it is a lower probability buy.

Emini V-bottom rally stalling.<li>That zone is the middle of the 6-month trading range at around a 50% retracement of the January selloff.<li>Also, it is testing the January 10 low, which is the highest of the 3 breakout points in the selloff.<li>I also have been saying that a bottom after a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down is more likely than a V-bottom since a V-bottom is uncommon.<li>If there is going to be a V-bottom, the bulls need to prevent this selloff from falling much further and from lasting more than a few days.<li>Yesterday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar after a strong rally, but it had a bear body. However, today’s unemployment report is more important and there is an increased chance of an early trend today.<li>If the Emini falls back below the top of last week’s tight trading range and then rallies strongly, it could still lead to a bull trend, but the bottom would be a higher low major trend reversal and not a V-bottom.<li>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want the week to be a big bull bar closing on its high. It would then be a strong entry bar after last week’s double bottom reversal. That would make higher prices likely next week.<li>At a minimum, the bulls want a bull body, preferably closing above its midpoint and above the December low. Traders would then look for sideways to up trading next week.<li>If this week is a bear bar closing on its low, it would be a Low 1 sell signal bar on the weekly chart for next week. Traders would expect lower prices.<li>There are back-to-back OO patterns on the monthly chart (consecutive outside bars). That is a 2<sup>nd</sup>attempt to reverse down late in a bull trend, which has a higher probability. January was a bear bar that closed below its midpoint, which further increases the chance of lower prices over the next couple months.<li>The Emini should fall below the January low in February or March, which would trigger the monthly OO sell signal.<li>But because the monthly bull trend has been strong, the reversal down should only last 2 to 3 months.<li>The odds favor a new high before a bear trend reversal on the monthly chart.<li>However, a 3-month selloff might lead to a trading range, which could last a year or more. But even if it lasts a long time, traders should expect at least one more new high before there is more than about a 20% selloff.<li>There is a 50% chance that the current reversal down will continue to below 4,000 within a few months.<li>There is only a 30% chance that it will test the pre-pandemic high, which is the February 2020 high, just above 3,300. That is the most important breakout point of the 2-year rally.<li>Last week, I created a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bEmPP9N7tk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">video in which I discuss what the next few years might be like</a>.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 20 points in the overnight Globex session just after the unemployment report.<li>The bulls are hoping this is just a test of yesterday’s low and that today will reverse up from a double bottom.<li>The bears hope today will be a bear trend that again breaks below the October low and continues down to the pre-pandemic high over the next few weeks.<li>What will happen? Traders need more information, which means more bars.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down on the open, today will probably be a trend day.<li>However, Big Down in January and Big Up in February creates Big Confusion. It makes traders less willing to press bets in either direction and it increases the chance of the market going sideways for two or three days. When a market is sideways, it typically has swings in both directions, which means a lot of trading range trading.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-bear-flag-at-EMA-and-bear-channel-but-late-bull-trend-reversal-ahead-of-tomorrows-unemployment-report-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-4.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bear flag at EMA and bear channel but late bull trend reversal ahead of unemployment report. V-bottom rally stalling.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-Forex-minor-double-top-after-strong-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-4-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex minor double top after strong bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday was another big bull day and it closed above the top of the yearlong bear channel.<li>I have been saying for a couple months that a breakout below the November/December trading range would fail. This is because a tight trading range late in a bear trend is typically the Final Bear Flag.<li>Additionally, I have been saying that the rally should last at least a couple months.<li>Targets above are the January 14 lower high, and then breakout points on the day day. These include the October 12 low, the November 4, 2020 low, and the March 2021 low.<li>Another target is a 50% retracement of the 2021 bear trend.<li>Will this rally reach all of the targets? Maybe 50-50 right now.<li>But if next week is a bull bar on the weekly chart closing on its high, there would be a 60% chance of a breakout above the November 2020 low. That was the bottom of a yearlong trading range within the 7-year trading range. When a market reverses in a trading range, it usually goes beyond breakout points.<li>Can the bears create a double top bear flag with the January 14 high? Today’s high so far is a fraction of a pip above that high, and today currently is near the low of the day.<li>They will try, but the rally has been strong enough so traders will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down. Therefore, the bears will need at least a reversal down from a micro double top next week before they would have a 50% chance of a reversal down to below the January low.<li>What if Russia invades the Ukraine? It would hurt Europe and probably the EURUSD, but it would also hurt the US and possibly the dollar. It is too early to tell what the EURUSD will do.<li>There is only a small chance of Putin invading while the Winter Olympics are going on. Putin cannot risk alienating Xi.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-almost-outside-up-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and small pullback bull trend and almost outside up day\"></a></figure><p><em>Al created the SP500 Emini charts.</em><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Today sold off from a wedge at the EMA, but reversed up from a wedge at just below the January 26 high.<li>The rally continued in a Small Pullback Bull Trend to above the 60-minute EMA and yesterday’s close.<li>The Emini reversed down into the close from a measured move target that was just below yesterday’s high, forming an Almost Outside Up Day.<li>Today is a High Buy signal bar on the daily chart, but because of the small bull body, it is a lower probability buy. That increases the chance of another sideways day on Monday.<li>While this week had a bull body on the weekly chart, the week closed just below its midpoint. That reduces the chance of a strong rally next week.<li>The 2-day pullback might last another day or so, but the odds favor at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up next week after the strong rally from below the bottom of the 6-month trading range.<li>Traders are deciding if the rally is a pullback from the January collapse or a resumption of the 2-year bull trend. So far, this is a continuation of the 6-month trading range.<li>The market has already priced in Russia invading the Ukraine.<li>What we don’t know is whether in fact Putin will invade, and if he invades, how Europe will respond.<li>The current price of the market is due to current information.

It closed slightly below the middle of the bar and is a sell signal bar for February. However, the long tail below makes it a weaker sell signal bar. The bar after an outside bar sometimes is an inside bar.<p>If February closes as an inside bar, there would be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern which is a breakout mode situation. The Emini is currently trading in the middle of the 7-month trading range and is an area of balance. Traders are still deciding whether the recent rally is a pullback from January’s selloff or a resumption of the bull trend. Lack of clarity is the hallmark of a trading range.<p>The&nbsp;<strong>EURUSD&nbsp;</strong>Forex was a Bull Surprise Bar after last week’s strong breakout below the tight trading range and below June 2020’s low. It is a failed breakout below a potential final bear flag. The bulls will need to create strong follow-through buying far above the January 14 high to convince traders that a reversal higher is underway. The bears hope that this is simply a buy vacuum test of the trading range high and want a re-test of the trading range lows and a continuation of the 700-pip measured move lower.<h2 id=\"1-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Monthly-Jan-OO-Bear-Bar-with-Tail-Below.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-6.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart January Outside Down Bear Bar with Tail Below\"></a></figure><ul><li>The January monthly Emini candlestick was an outside down bar with a long tail below after an outside up December. It closed above the December low but slightly below the middle of the bar. It is a slightly bearish bar.<li>However, the long tail below indicates that the bears are not as strong as they would have liked to be.<li>January is the second OO (outside-outside) pattern after the October OO and the market is in a Breakout Mode. Consecutive attempts at a top late in a trend have an increased chance of a reversal down. January is the sell signal bar for the OO. If February or March trades below the January low, it will trigger the OO sell signal.&nbsp;<li>February currently is a small inside doji bar. Sometimes the bar after an outside bar is an inside bar.<li>The bears want a breakout below January and a measured move based on the height of the OO which will take them to around 3600. However, while January closed slightly below the middle of the bar, it has a long tail below. That is not a strong sell signal bar. Selling below a moderate sell signal bar at the bottom of a 7-month trading range may be risky if more traders think the trading range is more important and would, therefore, BLSH (Buy Low Sell High).<li>The bears will need February to close as another bear follow-through bar below January’s low to convince traders that a deeper correction is underway.<li>The bulls see the January selloff as a long-overdue pullback. They want a reversal higher from a double bottom bull flag with the October low and a retest of the trend extreme and a subsequent breakout to a new high.<li>The Emini is currently in the middle of a 7-month trading range. This is an area of balance. Traders are still deciding whether February or March should trade above or below January’s range.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Even if it sells off for a 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart (even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart) and not continue straight down into a bear trend.&nbsp;<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months to around a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number<li>We have said that this rally is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming which makes it less likely that it will continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback. January was the pullback.<li>Most pullbacks since the pandemic crash only lasted 1 month (Jan 2021, Sept 2021, Nov 2021) except for Sept-Oct 2020 which lasted 2 months. (On a side note, there was a lot of uncertainty during Sept-Oct 2020 period leading into the election between Trump vs Biden.)<li>Will February be a consecutive bear bar? Or will January be another 1-month pullback on the chart?<li>Al has said that the issue of Russia invading Ukraine is already priced in. If there is a surprise either way, there will likely be a strong breakout in either direction.<li>Al has also been saying that the bull trend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from the pandemic crash</a>&nbsp;has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months.&nbsp;<li>The gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3 id=\"3-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Weekly-Bull-Bar-with-Tail-above-Closing-above-Dec.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-6-1.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Bull Bar with Tail Above Closing Above December.\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a bull bar with a long tail above. While the bulls got follow-through buying this week, the weekly candlestick closed slightly below the middle of the bar and has a long tail above which indicates that the bulls are not as strong as they could have been.&nbsp;<li>This week triggered the high 1 buy signal by trading above last week’s high.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce) from a lower high major trend reversal. It would then be a reversal lower from a head &amp; shoulders (H&amp;S) top where the lower high is the right shoulder.<li>The bears want the pullback (bounce) to have overlapping bars with bear bars closing near the lows and weak bull bars. If they get that, the odds of a strong second leg lower increases.<li>However, a H&amp;S top often is a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>push down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>The bulls see the selloff in January as a bear trap and a sell vacuum test of the bottom of the 7-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>Since this week closed slightly below the middle of the bar and has a long tail above, it is not a strong buy signal bar for next week. Because of the strong reversal up from the bottom of the 7-month trading range, traders expect at least a small second sideways to up leg next week.<li>The bulls want consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. If they get that in the next 1 to 3 weeks, it can lead to a retest of the trend extreme.<li>Can next week be a big bear bar closing near the low? The selloff in January was strong enough for traders to expect a second sideways to down leg lower after a pullback (bounce). For now, the bounce may still have another week or two to go.<li>Traders are still deciding if the rally in the last 2 weeks was a pullback from the January collapse or a resumption of the 2-year bull trend. The Emini is trading around the middle of the 7-month trading range and that is an area of balance. Lack of clarity is the hallmark of a trading range.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>Al has said that the best the bears probably can get this year is a 20% correction down to around the 4,000 Big Round Number. This remains true.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Daily-V-Bottom-or-Lower-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-6-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart V-Bottom or Lower High\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini broke above the tight trading range and tested the December low and the 100-day moving average.

It is a high 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart, but because of the small bull body and prominent tail above, it is a lower probability buy signal bar. That increases the chance of another sideways day on Monday.<li>The rally from January 28 was strong enough for traders to expect at least a small second leg sideways to up next week.<li>Traders are still deciding if the rally is a pullback from the January collapse or a resumption of the 2-year bull trend. So far, this is a continuation of the 7-month trading range.<li>The Emini is trading around the middle of the 7-month trading range and that is an area of balance. Lack of clarity is the hallmark of a trading range.<li>The bulls see the recent selloff as a sell vacuum test of the trading range low which started in July 2021. As strong as the selling is, they want the selloff to simply be a bear leg in the developing 7-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>The selloff from the wedge top was stronger than all prior pullbacks since the pandemic crash. The move down from the high is in a tight bear channel which means strong selling.<li>Odds slightly favor a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce), probably from a double top bear flag with 2<sup>nd</sup>February high or January 12 high which was the start of the sell climax. The 50-day and 100-day moving average and the previous bull trend line are resistances above.<li>The bears want a reversal from a lower high which will be the right shoulder of a H&amp;S (head &amp; shoulders) top. They then want a strong break below the 6-month trading range and a measured move down to around 3600 based on the height of the 6-month trading range.<li>However, a H&amp;S top is often a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>leg down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>push down in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>Slightly less likely, the pullback (bounce) will turn into a V-Bottom testing the trend extreme like the one in October 2021. However, if the bulls get a series of consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in a tight bull channel, it can change the odds in the bull’s favor.<li>The Emini has the shape of an expanding triangle since September. The first of the legs are September 2, October 4, January 4, and January 24. If the bulls get a new high, it will be the 5<sup>th</sup>leg in the expanding triangle top.<li>Al said that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. By trading below October low, traders concluded that the bull trend has evolved into a trading range.<li>A trading range in a strong bull trend eventually turns into a bull flag instead of leading into a bear trend. The odds favor a continuation of the trend making a new high probably in the second half of the year or by next year.<li>For now, odds slightly favor at least a small leg sideways to up following the recent strong rally. Traders will then see whether the bulls can get another consecutive bull bars closing near their highs or the Emini stalls at some resistance above.<li>Should the second leg sideways to up be weak and stall at some resistance above, traders will then expect the second leg sideways to down following January’s selloff to begin soon.</ul><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-eurusd-monthly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>monthly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-Monthly-Jan-outside-Bear-Bar-Feb-Bull-Bar-TR.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-6-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Monthly Chart January Outside Bear Bar, February Bull Bar, Trading Range\"></a></figure><ul><li>January’s candlestick was an outside bear bar with tails above and below.

It closed slightly below the middle of the bar and is a sell signal bar for February. However, the long tail below makes it a weaker sell signal bar. The bar after an outside bar sometimes is an inside bar.<p>If February closes as an inside bar, there would be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern which is a breakout mode situation. The Emini is currently trading in the middle of the 7-month trading range and is an area of balance.

Lack of clarity is the hallmark of a trading range.<p>The&nbsp;<strong>EURUSD&nbsp;</strong>Forex was a Bull Surprise Bar after last week’s strong breakout below the tight trading range and below June 2020’s low. It is a failed breakout below a potential final bear flag. The bulls will need to create strong follow-through buying far above the January 14 high to convince traders that a reversal higher is underway. The bears hope that this is simply a buy vacuum test of the trading range high and want a re-test of the trading range lows and a continuation of the 700-pip measured move lower.<h2 id=\"1-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Monthly-Jan-OO-Bear-Bar-with-Tail-Below.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-6.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart January Outside Down Bear Bar with Tail Below\"></a></figure><ul><li>The January monthly Emini candlestick was an outside down bar with a long tail below after an outside up December. It closed above the December low but slightly below the middle of the bar. It is a slightly bearish bar.<li>However, the long tail below indicates that the bears are not as strong as they would have liked to be.<li>January is the second OO (outside-outside) pattern after the October OO and the market is in a Breakout Mode. Consecutive attempts at a top late in a trend have an increased chance of a reversal down. January is the sell signal bar for the OO. If February or March trades below the January low, it will trigger the OO sell signal.&nbsp;<li>February currently is a small inside doji bar. Sometimes the bar after an outside bar is an inside bar.<li>The bears want a breakout below January and a measured move based on the height of the OO which will take them to around 3600. However, while January closed slightly below the middle of the bar, it has a long tail below. That is not a strong sell signal bar. Selling below a moderate sell signal bar at the bottom of a 7-month trading range may be risky if more traders think the trading range is more important and would, therefore, BLSH (Buy Low Sell High).<li>The bears will need February to close as another bear follow-through bar below January’s low to convince traders that a deeper correction is underway.<li>The bulls see the January selloff as a long-overdue pullback. They want a reversal higher from a double bottom bull flag with the October low and a retest of the trend extreme and a subsequent breakout to a new high.<li>The Emini is currently in the middle of a 7-month trading range. This is an area of balance. Traders are still deciding whether February or March should trade above or below January’s range.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Even if it sells off for a 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart (even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart) and not continue straight down into a bear trend.&nbsp;<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months to around a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number<li>We have said that this rally is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming which makes it less likely that it will continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback. January was the pullback.<li>Most pullbacks since the pandemic crash only lasted 1 month (Jan 2021, Sept 2021, Nov 2021) except for Sept-Oct 2020 which lasted 2 months. (On a side note, there was a lot of uncertainty during Sept-Oct 2020 period leading into the election between Trump vs Biden.)<li>Will February be a consecutive bear bar? Or will January be another 1-month pullback on the chart?<li>Al has said that the issue of Russia invading Ukraine is already priced in. If there is a surprise either way, there will likely be a strong breakout in either direction.<li>Al has also been saying that the bull trend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from the pandemic crash</a>&nbsp;has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months.&nbsp;<li>The gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.</ul><h3 id=\"3-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Weekly-Bull-Bar-with-Tail-above-Closing-above-Dec.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-6-1.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Bull Bar with Tail Above Closing Above December.\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a bull bar with a long tail above. While the bulls got follow-through buying this week, the weekly candlestick closed slightly below the middle of the bar and has a long tail above which indicates that the bulls are not as strong as they could have been.&nbsp;<li>This week triggered the high 1 buy signal by trading above last week’s high.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce) from a lower high major trend reversal. It would then be a reversal lower from a head &amp; shoulders (H&amp;S) top where the lower high is the right shoulder.<li>The bears want the pullback (bounce) to have overlapping bars with bear bars closing near the lows and weak bull bars. If they get that, the odds of a strong second leg lower increases.<li>However, a H&amp;S top often is a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>push down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>The bulls see the selloff in January as a bear trap and a sell vacuum test of the bottom of the 7-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>Since this week closed slightly below the middle of the bar and has a long tail above, it is not a strong buy signal bar for next week. Because of the strong reversal up from the bottom of the 7-month trading range, traders expect at least a small second sideways to up leg next week.<li>The bulls want consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. If they get that in the next 1 to 3 weeks, it can lead to a retest of the trend extreme.<li>Can next week be a big bear bar closing near the low? The selloff in January was strong enough for traders to expect a second sideways to down leg lower after a pullback (bounce). For now, the bounce may still have another week or two to go.<li>Traders are still deciding if the rally in the last 2 weeks was a pullback from the January collapse or a resumption of the 2-year bull trend. The Emini is trading around the middle of the 7-month trading range and that is an area of balance. Lack of clarity is the hallmark of a trading range.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>Al has said that the best the bears probably can get this year is a 20% correction down to around the 4,000 Big Round Number. This remains true.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Daily-V-Bottom-or-Lower-High.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-6-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart V-Bottom or Lower High\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini broke above the tight trading range and tested the December low and the 100-day moving average. There was a pullback on Thursday, and Friday closed as an Almost Outside Up Day.<li>Friday’s candlestick has a bull body, but it has a prominent tail above. It is a high 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart, but because of the small bull body and prominent tail above, it is a lower probability buy signal bar. That increases the chance of another sideways day on Monday.<li>The rally from January 28 was strong enough for traders to expect at least a small second leg sideways to up next week.<li>Traders are still deciding if the rally is a pullback from the January collapse or a resumption of the 2-year bull trend. So far, this is a continuation of the 7-month trading range.<li>The Emini is trading around the middle of the 7-month trading range and that is an area of balance. Lack of clarity is the hallmark of a trading range.<li>The bulls see the recent selloff as a sell vacuum test of the trading range low which started in July 2021. As strong as the selling is, they want the selloff to simply be a bear leg in the developing 7-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>The selloff from the wedge top was stronger than all prior pullbacks since the pandemic crash. The move down from the high is in a tight bear channel which means strong selling.<li>Odds slightly favor a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce), probably from a double top bear flag with 2<sup>nd</sup>February high or January 12 high which was the start of the sell climax. The 50-day and 100-day moving average and the previous bull trend line are resistances above.<li>The bears want a reversal from a lower high which will be the right shoulder of a H&amp;S (head &amp; shoulders) top. They then want a strong break below the 6-month trading range and a measured move down to around 3600 based on the height of the 6-month trading range.<li>However, a H&amp;S top is often a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>leg down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>push down in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>Slightly less likely, the pullback (bounce) will turn into a V-Bottom testing the trend extreme like the one in October 2021. However, if the bulls get a series of consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in a tight bull channel, it can change the odds in the bull’s favor.<li>The Emini has the shape of an expanding triangle since September. The first of the legs are September 2, October 4, January 4, and January 24. If the bulls get a new high, it will be the 5<sup>th</sup>leg in the expanding triangle top.<li>Al said that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. By trading below October low, traders concluded that the bull trend has evolved into a trading range.<li>A trading range in a strong bull trend eventually turns into a bull flag instead of leading into a bear trend. The odds favor a continuation of the trend making a new high probably in the second half of the year or by next year.<li>For now, odds slightly favor at least a small leg sideways to up following the recent strong rally. Traders will then see whether the bulls can get another consecutive bull bars closing near their highs or the Emini stalls at some resistance above.<li>Should the second leg sideways to up be weak and stall at some resistance above, traders will then expect the second leg sideways to down following January’s selloff to begin soon.</ul><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-eurusd-monthly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>monthly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-Monthly-Jan-outside-Bear-Bar-Feb-Bull-Bar-TR.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-6-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Monthly Chart January Outside Bear Bar, February Bull Bar, Trading Range\"></a></figure><ul><li>January’s candlestick was an outside bear bar with tails above and below.

This would create a double top or a wedge top (January 26, February 2) and give the bears a reasonable chance at a short setup.<li>The market is very close to 50%-50% for both the bulls and the bears. The market is deciding between testing the January lows or the all-time high.<li>The Emini on the daily chart is clearly in a trading range, and the price is in the middle of the range from the October 2021 lows to the low of January 2022. The middle of any trading range is a bad area to initiate long or short positions, so it is better for most traders to wait for more clarity.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 12 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>The market will probably have a trading range open and test either the high or low of yesterday.<li>The market has already tested yesterday’s low during the early hours of the Globex session, so the market may have to test yesterday’s high as well.</ul><ul><li>Traders should expect limit order trading on the open and wait for either a strong breakout with follow-through or wait for a credible stop entry for a swing.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-top-and-bottom-then-double-top-with-sell-the-close-bear-trend-into-the-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-8.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and bottom then double top with sell the close bear trend into the close.

The bulls will buy every pullback expecting higher prices soon and a test of the October 2021 low, followed by the August 2021 low.<li>While the market is always in long, it still has not broken strongly above the January high. This means the market still may be in a trading range, and the bulls could have a much deeper pullback than they would like. Is the current pullback below yesterday likely to lead to a deep retracement of last week’s bull rally? Probably not, but if the bears can get a 2nd entry short, there would be a increased risk of a deeper retracement of last week’s rally.<li>At this moment, the odds are that the market will break above the January high. However, the bulls’ problem is that their risk is big, and their risk-reward is not great. This means that the bulls will be very quick to get out and will not let their stop hit below the January lows.<li>My point in bringing up the above is that if the market goes sideways around the January high, more and more bulls may think the probability of the upside breakout does not justify the large risk. Those bulls would exit and look to buy lower.

Since last week’s rally was a Bull Surprise, this week should test last week’s high.<li>They want a resumption of the V-bottom reversal up, and they want it to lead to a new all-time high.<li>The bears know that the Emini should trade up for at least a couple days. However, they are hoping that the 3-week rally is just a pullback from the January collapse. They want a lower high and a test of the January low.<li>The Emini is still in the middle of a 7-month trading range. It is therefore fairly neutral, despite the big selloff in January and the strong rally in February.<li>Traders need more information before being confident of a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down or a continuation of the V-bottom rally.<li>More information means more bars. If there is a series of strong bull bars, the Emini should make a new high soon.<li>If there is a series of bear bars, it should continue down to around 4,000.<li>On the monthly chart, there are now back-to-back OO patterns (consecutive outside bars).<li>This is coming late in the strong bull trend on the monthly chart. A 2<sup>nd</sup>attempt to reverse has a higher probability of success.<li>It is therefore still more likely that the rally from the January low will form a lower high on the daily chart, and it will lead to a test of the January low before making a new high.<li>In fact, because of the 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal attempt on the monthly chart, traders want to know what will happen if the OO sell signal triggers. Will there be more buyers or sellers below the January low?<li>The bulls hope the bear breakout below the January low will fail. Traders should understand that the selloff has a 50% chance of falling below the January low, a 40% chance of dipping below the 4,000 big round number, but only a 30% chance of reaching the pre-pandemic high.<li>They also should know that a bear trend on the monthly chart is rare. Therefore, the selloff should end in March or April.<li>February so far is a small inside bar on the monthly chart and it is in the middle of January’s huge range. I have said several times that February might remain in inside bar and it might even have a bull body.<li>However, it is still slightly more likely that the Emini will break below the January low before going above the January high. I also said that the breakout might wait until March.<li>When a selloff ends, either the bull trend resumes or the market enters a trading range.<li>Since the bull trend on the monthly chart is strong, there should be at least one more new high before the bears will have a reasonable chance of a bear trend on that chart.<li>Therefore, the bull trend should resume within a couple months, or after a trading range.<li>The bulls are hoping that the current rally is the resumption of the bull trend. If it is, there should be a new high within a month.<li>If the monthly chart enters a trading range, it could last as long as a year before there will be a new high, but a new high is likely before the bears can get much more than a 20% correction.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is 41 points in the overnight Globex session. Today should open with a big gap up. As I wrote above, the Emini should try to test last week’s high. Today is the start of that test. If today sells off, there will be a micro double top.<li>Whenever there is a big gap up, there is an increased chance of a trend day. If there is a trend, up is slightly more likely than down.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction early in the day, the odds of a trend go up.<li>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the average price (the EMA). Bulls only want to buy if the bars are very bullish.<li>Most of the time, a big gap up leads to a trading range open. The Emini goes sideways to down to near the EMA. At that point, the bulls look for a double bottom or wedge bottom, and then a trend up.<li>The bears know that the Emini typically gets near the EMA within the 1st hour or two. They look for a double top or a wedge top and then a swing down to the EMA.<li>Since a trading range open is likely, there tends to be some neutrality. That reduces the chance of a strong trend.<li>If there is a trend, it will probably be a weaker trend, like a trending trading range day or a broad channel.<li>If there is a strong trend up, there is an increased chance of exhaustion. The market tends to enter a trading range after a couple hours.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-outside-up-day-and-trend-resumption-up-day-with-higher-low-major-trend-reversal-and-failed-head-and-shoulders-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-9.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day and trend resumption up day with higher low major trend reversal and failed head and shoulders top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

I have been saying for a couple months that the trading range would be a Final Bear Flag and that a bear breakout would fail.<li>I have also been saying that the EURUSD should rally for at least a couple months. This is because the yearlong bear trend is still in an 8-year trading range.

Since the bear leg has lasted a long time and reached support at the June 26, 2020 higher low, last week’s rally will probably be the start of a leg up. A leg up should last at least a couple months.<li>The rally stalled at the January 14 high.

The bulls are trying again to break above the January 14 high. They should be successful within the next few days, but there is a 40% chance that the pullback will correct 50% of last week’s rally before the bulls get their breakout.<li>The bulls want a breakout above the double top and a measured move up to above 1.18. That is also around the October 28 high, which was the start of the strong leg down. This is more likely than a breakout below the January low.<li>But, what if Russia invades the Ukraine AND Europe messes up the response?

I have been saying for a couple months that the trading range would be a Final Bear Flag and that a bear breakout would fail.<li>I have also been saying that the EURUSD should rally for at least a couple months. This is because the yearlong bear trend is still in an 8-year trading range. It is therefore more likely a leg in the range than a resumption of the 15-year bear trend.<li>A bear leg in a trading range usually leads to a bull leg. Since the bear leg has lasted a long time and reached support at the June 26, 2020 higher low, last week’s rally will probably be the start of a leg up. A leg up should last at least a couple months.<li>The rally stalled at the January 14 high. It could go sideways to down for a few weeks as traders decide between a reversal down from a double top and a break above the January 14 high.<li>The bears want a reversal down from a double top and then a measured move down below the January low.<li>Today so far is a bull bar closing near its high. The bulls are trying again to break above the January 14 high. They should be successful within the next few days, but there is a 40% chance that the pullback will correct 50% of last week’s rally before the bulls get their breakout.<li>The bulls want a breakout above the double top and a measured move up to above 1.18. That is also around the October 28 high, which was the start of the strong leg down. This is more likely than a breakout below the January low.<li>But, what if Russia invades the Ukraine AND Europe messes up the response? The EURUSD will quickly go down to the bottom of the 8-year range.<li>At the moment, the chart is saying that if Russia invades, Europe will handle it well, and the crisis won’t be disastrous for the EURUSD.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-bull-flag-at-the-EMA-and-then-220-Gap-Bar-Buy-and-Broad-Bull-Channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bull flag at the EMA and then 220-Gap Bar Buy and Broad Bull Channel\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>The Emini had a big gap up, and then went sideways, as it usually does after a big gap.<li>The bulls had a weak rally for a couple hours to just below last week’s high. Remember, I said that last week’s rally was strong enough to expect a test of its high.<li>After consecutive wedges at a new high of the day, the Emini reversed down sharply, back into the earlier trading range (today, a triangle).<li>It then reversed up sharply to a new high and then sharply again. The Emini today was in a Broad Bull Channel.<li>Big legs and sharp reversals indicate uncertainty and usually results in a trading range. Traders are probably nervous ahead of tomorrow’s inflation report.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

As Al said yesterday, there is only a 40% chance the market will reach the 4,000 round number.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 60+ points in the overnight Globex session.<li>The bears got a strong breakout during the 5:30 report during the Globex session.<li>As I stated above, the daily chart is in a trading range, so the odds are the bulls will be disappointed over the next few days.<li>Today will be a gap down. Bulls will want a trend from the open, bears will want a bear trend day, and will look to sell any pullback to the moving average.<li>Today will likely open as a trading range day, and traders will either wait for a clear breakout with follow-through or a credible stop entry before taking any swing trades.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-bull-flag-at-the-EMA-and-then-220-Gap-Bar-Buy-and-Broad-Bull-Channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-10.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bull flag at the EMA and then 220-Gap Bar Buy and Broad Bull Channel\"></a></figure><p><em>Al created the SP500 Emini charts.</em><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The 2-month trading range ended up being a final flag reversal.<li>The bears have had a selloff on the daily chart since May 2021. Last week’s breakout is likely the start of a two-month rally. On the higher time frames, this selloff looks like a bear leg in what will become a trading range, which means the bulls should get at least a rally for a couple of months on the daily chart.<li>Last week broke slightly above the January 14<sup>th</sup>high.<li>The bulls want a breakout and measured move up (1.18) of the two-month trading range. (See measured move projection on the chart).<li>The bears see last week’s rally as a double top with the January highs and want a measured move down.<li>Right now, the odds are that the bulls will get their bull breakout; however, the market is still in a trading range. This means that the market might get a deeper pullback to around 50% of last week’s bull rally. At the moment maybe a 40% chance we get the deep pullback.<li>Even if the market has a 50% pullback of last week’s rally, the odds are bulls will get their breakout and measured move up.<li>Al mentioned yesterday that the EURUSD chart is likely telling us that if Russia invades, Europe will probably handle it well. I bring this up because it is a good reminder that most news is already baked into the chart. However, as Al said, if Europe does not handle the potential conflict well, it could result in a pain trade and lead to a sharp move back down to the January lows.<li>Update: As I am writing, the bears got a sharp reversal down to the lows of the past several days. The bears are trying for a bear breakout and measured move down and ultimately want to reverse the strong breakout of last week. The odds still favor the bulls getting their second leg up and that this bear breakout on the intraday chart is likely just a sell vacuum testing the bottom of the range from the past couple of days. &nbsp;</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-parabolic-wedge-and-bear-trend-reversal-below-Globex-high-and-reached-measured-move-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge and bear trend reversal below Globex high and reached measured move down\"></a></figure><p><em>Al created the SP500 Emini charts.</em><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Today was a trend from the open that formed a buy climax (parabolic wedge) that led to a bear breakout.<li>The opening rally tested yesterday’s close and went sideways for 20 bars forming a wedge lower high major trend reversal.<li>The bears got a surprise bear breakout on bar 40 that started a bear trend into the close.<li>Bar 46 formed a measuring gap from a measured move of the high of the day projecting down.<li>Today is a good reminder that strong trends constantly form wedge bottoms that fail.<li>To cool off the consecutive sell climaxes today, traders should expect a&nbsp; trading range on the open for a few hours.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday rallied on the open, but then sold off to a new low after again testing the February 2 high.<li>While it closed near its low, it is still within an 8-day tight trading range. That means it is in Breakout Mode.<li>The bulls need a strong breakout above that February 2 high before traders will be confident that the January 4 bottom will hold.<li>I said last week that the Emini would test the February 2 high, which it did Wednesday and again yesterday.<li>I also said that the January selloff was so strong that the rally should form a lower high and then test the January low.<li>If the Emini reverses down from here, there will be a double top with the February 2 high.<li>If it breaks above that high and then reverses down, there will be a wedge top where January 26 was the 1<sup>st</sup>top and February 2 was the 2<sup>nd</sup>top.<li>A reversal down would also be a lower high major trend reversal and the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top (the November 5 high as the left shoulder).<li>It is still more likely that the strong rally over the past 2 weeks will reverse down before breaking to a new high. The Emini has been in a trading range for 7 months and strong legs up and down are more likely to reverse than lead to a trend.<li>Also, there are back to back OO patterns on the monthly chart. They are consecutive attempts to reverse the strong bull trend from the pandemic low. A 2<sup>nd</sup>attempt has a higher probability of success.<li>At a minimum, traders should expect a break below the January low before a break above the January high. That would trigger the OO sell signal on the monthly chart. I have been saying that the selloff would probably last 2 to 3 months.<li>There is currently a 50% chance that the Emini will test the 4,000 Big Round Number before making a new high.<li>There is only a 30% chance that a selloff will reach the pre-pandemic high.<li>But even if it does, there will still likely be at least one more new high before the monthly chart could selloff for more than a few months.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 4 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a sell climax day. There is a 50% chance of some follow-through selling in the 1st hour.<li>There is also a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>The week closed near the open of the week. This week so far is a small doji bar on the weekly chart in the middle of last week’s range.<li>Other nearby magnets are the December low, the open of the month and the December 20 low.<li>If this week is a big bear bar on the weekly chart, next week will probably be lower.<li>If this week closes on the high of the week, next week will probably be higher.<li>If it closes around where it is, the week will be more neutral.

If February or March trades below the January low, it will trigger the OO sell signal.&nbsp;<li>Al has said that due to the back to back OO, traders should expect a break below the January low before a break above the January high. A 2nd attempt has a higher probability of success. That would trigger the OO sell signal on the monthly chart and the selloff would probably last 2 to 3 months.<li>The bears want a breakout below January and a measured move based on the height of the OO which will take them to around 3600. However, while January closed slightly below the middle of the bar, it has a long tail below. That is not a strong sell signal bar. Selling below a moderate sell signal bar at the bottom of a 7-month trading range may be risky if more traders think the trading range is more important and would, therefore, BLSH (Buy Low Sell High).<li>The bears will need February to close as another bear follow-through bar below January’s low to convince traders that a deeper correction is underway.<li>The bulls see the January selloff as a long-overdue pullback. They want a reversal higher from a double bottom bull flag with the October low and a retest of the trend extreme and a subsequent breakout to a new high.<li>The Emini is currently trading slightly below the middle of the 7-month trading range. If the bears get another 2 to 3 days of strong trend days, they may be able to test the January low soon after.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Even if it sells off for a 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart (even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart) and not continue straight down into a bear trend.&nbsp;<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months to around a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number<li>We have said that this rally is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming which makes it less likely that it will continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback.

The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months.&nbsp;<li>The gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.<li>However, if Russia invades Ukraine this weekend, and especially if Europe has a weak response, the Emini may drop to below 4000 quickly.</ul><h3 id=\"3-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Weekly-Micro-Double-Top-–-Lower-High-MTR.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-13-1.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Micro Double Top Lower High MTR - Bear Bar Closing Near Low\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a bear bar closing near the low with a long tail above, closing slightly above last week’s low.&nbsp;<li>The bulls tested the February 2 high twice on Wednesday and Thursday but failed to trade above it.

The bears will need to create another bear follow-through bar next week to convince traders that a move lower is underway.<li>We have been saying that the bears want a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce) from a lower high major trend reversal. It would then be a reversal lower from a head &amp; shoulders (H&amp;S) top where the lower high is the right shoulder. However, an H&amp;S top often is a minor reversal pattern. The 3rd push down from the right shoulder often is the 3rd leg in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>The bears want the pullback (bounce) to have overlapping bars with bear bars closing near the lows and weak bull bars. If they get that, the odds of a strong second leg lower increases.<li>The pullback (bounce) so far has overlapping bars (last week and this week). The bull bar last week closed below the middle of the bar with a long tail above, and this week was a bear bar closing near low.<li>The bears want the second leg lower from the January sell-off to begin soon followed by a test and a breakout below January’s low.&nbsp;<li>The bulls see the selloff in January as a sell vacuum test of the bottom of the 7-month trading range. However, they were not able to create strong consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in the last 2 weeks.<li>The bulls want next week to be a bull bar even if the Emini trades slightly lower first. If next week is a big bear bar closing near low, the odds of a test below January low increases.<li>We have said that the selloff in January was strong enough for traders to expect a second leg sideways to down after a pullback (bounce). This remains true.<li>This week traded below last week’s low, triggering the low 1 sell signal. Since this week is a strong sell signal bar closing near the low, next week should trade at least slightly lower.&nbsp;<li>Monday may gap down at the open.

The more consecutive bear bars closing near their lows, the higher the odds of a breakout below January’s low.<li>However, if the second leg lower is more sideways with overlapping bars, bull bars closing near their highs, long tails below and weak bear bars, traders will then conclude that the 2-legged pullback is ending soon.<li>The Emini is trading slightly below the middle of the 7-month trading range. Lack of clarity is the hallmark of a trading range.&nbsp;<li>The 50-week moving average and the bull trend line are supports below.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>Al has said that the best the bears probably can get this year is a 20% correction down to around the 4,000 Big Round Number. This remains true.<li>However, major global events like Russia invading Ukraine can cause the Emini to quickly drop to below 4000.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Daily-Lower-High-MTR-–-Double-Top-Bear-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-13-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart Lower High MTR Double Top Bear Flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>Last week, we said that odds slightly favor at least a small leg sideways to up following the recent strong rally. Traders will then see whether the bulls can get another consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. Or the Emini stalls at some resistance above and if the second leg sideways to up is weak and stall at some resistance above, traders will then expect the second leg sideways to down following January’s selloff to begin soon.<li>The Emini tested the February 2 high on Wednesday and Thursday but stalled and reversed lower by Friday from a double top bear flag and closed below the 200-day moving average.<li>We have said that odds slightly favor a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce), probably from a double top bear flag with 2<sup>nd</sup>February high or January 12 high which was the start of the sell climax. The 50-day and 100-day moving average and the previous bull trend line are resistances above. This remains true.<li>After 2 failed attempts to trade higher (last week and this week), the Emini may now go the opposite direction next.<li>The bears want a reversal from a lower high major trend reversal which will be the right shoulder of an H&amp;S (head &amp; shoulders) top. They then want a strong break below the 6-month trading range and a measured move down to around 3600 based on the height of the 6-month trading range. However, a H&amp;S top is often a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>leg down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>push down in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>Bears want this to be the start of the second leg lower to test January’s low. They want consecutive bear bars closing near their lows.<li>Friday broke below the 8-day trading range. If Monday is another bear bar, especially if it is big and closes near its low, traders will look for a measured move down below the 8-day trading range. That would be a test of the January 28 low and the January low.<li>The bulls see the January selloff as a sell vacuum test of the trading range low which started in July 2021. As strong as the selling is, they want the selloff to simply be a bear leg in the developing 7-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>The bulls want consecutive bull bars closing near their highs next week, even if the Emini trades slightly lower first. If they get that, traders will see that the second leg sideways to down attempt is weak. It would likely lead to some profit-taking from bears and a stronger reversal higher from a double bottom (either higher low or lower low) major trend reversal around the lower third of the 7-month trading range.<li>For now, next week should trade at least slightly lower. Since Friday closed near the low, Monday could gap down at the open. Small gaps usually close early.<li>Al said that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. By trading below October low, traders concluded that the bull trend has evolved into a trading range.<li>A trading range in a strong bull trend eventually turns into a bull flag instead of leading into a bear trend. The odds favor a continuation of the trend making a new high probably in the second half of the year or by next year.<li>If there is a Russian invasion of Ukraine and Europe has a weak response, it may cause a sharp selloff to below 4,000.</ul><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-Weekly-Failed-BO-above-Tight-Trading-Range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-13-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Weekly Chart Failed Breakout above Tight Trading Range\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a bear bar closing near low.

Selling below a moderate sell signal bar at the bottom of a 7-month trading range may be risky if more traders think the trading range is more important and would, therefore, BLSH (Buy Low Sell High).<li>The bears will need February to close as another bear follow-through bar below January’s low to convince traders that a deeper correction is underway.<li>The bulls see the January selloff as a long-overdue pullback. They want a reversal higher from a double bottom bull flag with the October low and a retest of the trend extreme and a subsequent breakout to a new high.<li>The Emini is currently trading slightly below the middle of the 7-month trading range. If the bears get another 2 to 3 days of strong trend days, they may be able to test the January low soon after.<li>Al has said that the bull trend on the monthly chart has been very strong. Even if it sells off for a 10 to 20% correction, that would still only be a pullback on the monthly chart (even though it could be a bear trend on the daily chart) and not continue straight down into a bear trend.&nbsp;<li>The best the bears will probably get on the monthly chart is a trading range for many months to around a 20% correction down to the gap on the monthly chart below April 2021 low and around the 4,000 Big Round Number<li>We have said that this rally is overextended and there is a likely micro wedge forming which makes it less likely that it will continue up throughout 2022 without a pullback. January was the pullback.<li>Most pullbacks since the pandemic crash only lasted 1 month (Jan 2021, Sept 2021, Nov 2021) except for Sept-Oct 2020 which lasted 2 months. (On a side note, there was a lot of uncertainty during Sept-Oct 2020 period leading into the election between Trump vs Biden.)<li>Will February be a consecutive bear bar? Or will January be another 1-month pullback on the chart?<li>Al has been saying that the bull trend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from the pandemic crash</a>&nbsp;has been in a very tight bull channel. The first reversal down will probably be minor even if it lasts a few months.&nbsp;<li>The gap up in April 2021 could lead to a measured move up to 5,801.5 before the bull trend finally ends.<li>However, if Russia invades Ukraine this weekend, and especially if Europe has a weak response, the Emini may drop to below 4000 quickly.</ul><h3 id=\"3-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Weekly-Micro-Double-Top-–-Lower-High-MTR.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-13-1.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Micro Double Top Lower High MTR - Bear Bar Closing Near Low\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini weekly candlestick was a bear bar closing near the low with a long tail above, closing slightly above last week’s low.&nbsp;<li>The bulls tested the February 2 high twice on Wednesday and Thursday but failed to trade above it. The Emini then reversed into a bear bar closing near the low by Friday.<li>This week’s bear bar closing near low is a good sell signal bar for next week. The bears will need to create another bear follow-through bar next week to convince traders that a move lower is underway.<li>We have been saying that the bears want a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce) from a lower high major trend reversal. It would then be a reversal lower from a head &amp; shoulders (H&amp;S) top where the lower high is the right shoulder. However, an H&amp;S top often is a minor reversal pattern. The 3rd push down from the right shoulder often is the 3rd leg in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>The bears want the pullback (bounce) to have overlapping bars with bear bars closing near the lows and weak bull bars. If they get that, the odds of a strong second leg lower increases.<li>The pullback (bounce) so far has overlapping bars (last week and this week). The bull bar last week closed below the middle of the bar with a long tail above, and this week was a bear bar closing near low.<li>The bears want the second leg lower from the January sell-off to begin soon followed by a test and a breakout below January’s low.&nbsp;<li>The bulls see the selloff in January as a sell vacuum test of the bottom of the 7-month trading range. However, they were not able to create strong consecutive bull bars closing near their highs in the last 2 weeks.<li>The bulls want next week to be a bull bar even if the Emini trades slightly lower first. If next week is a big bear bar closing near low, the odds of a test below January low increases.<li>We have said that the selloff in January was strong enough for traders to expect a second leg sideways to down after a pullback (bounce). This remains true.<li>This week traded below last week’s low, triggering the low 1 sell signal. Since this week is a strong sell signal bar closing near the low, next week should trade at least slightly lower.&nbsp;<li>Monday may gap down at the open. Small gaps usually close early.<li>Traders will be monitoring the strength of the second leg lower. The more consecutive bear bars closing near their lows, the higher the odds of a breakout below January’s low.<li>However, if the second leg lower is more sideways with overlapping bars, bull bars closing near their highs, long tails below and weak bear bars, traders will then conclude that the 2-legged pullback is ending soon.<li>The Emini is trading slightly below the middle of the 7-month trading range. Lack of clarity is the hallmark of a trading range.&nbsp;<li>The 50-week moving average and the bull trend line are supports below.<li>Al has said that the Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the pandemic crash. There have been a few times when the bears got the probability of a correction up to 50%, but never more. The probability of higher prices has been between 50 and 60% during this entire bull trend. It has never been below 50%. That continues to be true.<li>The strong selloffs, like in September 2020 and again in 2021, pushed the probability for the bears up to 50%. But every prior reversal has failed, and the bears never had better than a 50% chance of a trend reversal.<li>Al has said that the best the bears probably can get this year is a 20% correction down to around the 4,000 Big Round Number. This remains true.<li>However, major global events like Russia invading Ukraine can cause the Emini to quickly drop to below 4000.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-Daily-Lower-High-MTR-–-Double-Top-Bear-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-13-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart Lower High MTR Double Top Bear Flag\"></a></figure><ul><li>Last week, we said that odds slightly favor at least a small leg sideways to up following the recent strong rally. Traders will then see whether the bulls can get another consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. Or the Emini stalls at some resistance above and if the second leg sideways to up is weak and stall at some resistance above, traders will then expect the second leg sideways to down following January’s selloff to begin soon.<li>The Emini tested the February 2 high on Wednesday and Thursday but stalled and reversed lower by Friday from a double top bear flag and closed below the 200-day moving average.<li>We have said that odds slightly favor a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce), probably from a double top bear flag with 2<sup>nd</sup>February high or January 12 high which was the start of the sell climax. The 50-day and 100-day moving average and the previous bull trend line are resistances above. This remains true.<li>After 2 failed attempts to trade higher (last week and this week), the Emini may now go the opposite direction next.<li>The bears want a reversal from a lower high major trend reversal which will be the right shoulder of an H&amp;S (head &amp; shoulders) top. They then want a strong break below the 6-month trading range and a measured move down to around 3600 based on the height of the 6-month trading range. However, a H&amp;S top is often a minor reversal pattern. The 3<sup>rd</sup>leg down from the right shoulder often is the 3<sup>rd</sup>push down in what will become a wedge bull flag.<li>Bears want this to be the start of the second leg lower to test January’s low. They want consecutive bear bars closing near their lows.<li>Friday broke below the 8-day trading range. If Monday is another bear bar, especially if it is big and closes near its low, traders will look for a measured move down below the 8-day trading range. That would be a test of the January 28 low and the January low.<li>The bulls see the January selloff as a sell vacuum test of the trading range low which started in July 2021. As strong as the selling is, they want the selloff to simply be a bear leg in the developing 7-month trading range.&nbsp;<li>The bulls want consecutive bull bars closing near their highs next week, even if the Emini trades slightly lower first. If they get that, traders will see that the second leg sideways to down attempt is weak. It would likely lead to some profit-taking from bears and a stronger reversal higher from a double bottom (either higher low or lower low) major trend reversal around the lower third of the 7-month trading range.<li>For now, next week should trade at least slightly lower. Since Friday closed near the low, Monday could gap down at the open. Small gaps usually close early.<li>Al said that the entire rally from July looks like a bull leg in what will become a trading range. By trading below October low, traders concluded that the bull trend has evolved into a trading range.<li>A trading range in a strong bull trend eventually turns into a bull flag instead of leading into a bear trend. The odds favor a continuation of the trend making a new high probably in the second half of the year or by next year.<li>If there is a Russian invasion of Ukraine and Europe has a weak response, it may cause a sharp selloff to below 4,000.</ul><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-Weekly-Failed-BO-above-Tight-Trading-Range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-13-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Weekly Chart Failed Breakout above Tight Trading Range\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a bear bar closing near low.

The bears want follow-through after February 11 and are hopeful this is a double top lower high, major trend reversal setup that will break below the January lows.<li>The odds have favored a test of the January lows soon before a rally up to the January highs.<li>February 11 was a strong bear bar, and bears are hopeful this is a give-up bar that will lead to the January lows.

Since the market has been in a trading range for the past six months, the odds are the bears will be disappointed, and today will be a bull trend bar or a weak bear bar.<li>The bulls will be hopeful that February 11 is a second-leg trap that will trap eager bears into a bad short and be followed by a rally up to the all-time high.<li>Last Friday, the bears broke below the eight-day trading range and bears hope to achieve a measured move down projecting to around 4300. Next, the bears will want a break below the January lows followed by a measured move down from the February range.<li>The market probably only has a 40% chance getting a successful breakout below the January lows.<li>However, with the Winter Olympics coming to an end this week, it is possible Russia invades Ukraine, and if that were to happen, that would be enough of a major event to lead to a strong breakout below the January lows.<li>Traders should expect continued sideways and confusion on the daily chart.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 5 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Traders will expect trading range price action on the open.

This means bulls will look for a credible swing buy early in the day for a possible trend from the open. Bull will also look to buy any selloff, especially a test falling below today’s lows.<li>Traders also need to be open to a strong bear trend day, which would be follow-through after last Friday’s bear bar.<li>Traders pay close attention to the open of the day, and if the market is not far from it late in the day, they will look to bet on a close around the open of the day.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-measured-move-down-with-many-bull-traps.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and measured move down with many bull traps.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-Feb-14-2022.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-14-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Daily Chart Bulls want High 2 Buy Setup\"></a></figure><ul><li>The market sold off last Friday and today reached a 50% retracement of the strong bull breakout ending on February 4.<li>Today, the bears want another strong bear bar to raise the probability of lower prices.<li>Even if the bears get a second strong bear trend bar today, that would increase the odds of a trading range. This does not mean a high probability of selling off to the January lows. It just means the odds would favor more sideways.<li>More likely, today will be disappointing for the bears, confirming that this selloff is likely a pullback from the 5 bar bull breakout and the odds still favor a bull breakout and second leg up that test the October lows.<li>Traders can argue that February 10 was the second leg for the bulls, and therefore, the requirement of a second leg has been met. However, bulls will likely need a more credible test before traders expect lower prices.<li>The bears have a credible double top with the January and February highs. While it is not likely the bears get a bear breakout below the neckline (January low), if Europe handles the possible Russian invasion of&nbsp;Ukraine poorly, that could be the catalyst for a successful bear breakout and measured move down.<li>Overall, today is important to see how convicted both sides are. The bulls have a possible second leg trap, and if they can get a strong bull signal bar today, it may set up a reasonable stop entry buy for tomorrow. That could lead to a test of the February highs.<li>The bears have a surprise bar with last Friday’s bear breakout and are hopeful it leads to a small second leg down. More likely, we are in a trading range, which means today will likely be disappointing for both the bulls and the bears. &nbsp;</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-double-bottom-higher-low-major-trend-reversal-in-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and double bottom higher low major trend reversal in trading range day\"></a></figure><p><em>Al created the SP500 Emini charts.</em><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>The market had a trading range open that led to a 2nd entry short at bar 6.<li>Bar 7 was a strong enough surprise to lead to a couple of legs down and a wedge bottom.<li>The wedge bottom down to bar 14 was tight, so most traders would wait for a strong bull breakout or a pullback from the breakout, which the bulls got on bar 16 &amp; 20 (double bottom higher low major trend reversal).<li>Next, the bulls were able to rally to the high of the day in the form of consecutive wedge tops and a failed breakout above the prior high at bar 5.<li>Around bar 47, the bears got a bear breakout that led to a new low of the day.<li>The bears were hopeful the bar 47 would lead to a double top and measured move down of the initial range; however, bears bought back shorts below the low of bar 14, &nbsp;and bulls started buying aggressively.<li>Overall, trading range day is important to pay attention to the lack of consecutive big trend bars. While bar 53 was a big bear bar breaking below support, it followed consecutive sell climaxes. Also, the follow-through after bar 53 bear breakout was not that impressive and had a lot of overlap.<li>On a trading range day, traders will pay attention to the open of the day and look to fade the market and bet on a retracement back to the open of the day.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This does not mean a high probability of selling off to the January lows. It just means the odds would favor more sideways.<li>More likely, today will be disappointing for the bears, confirming that this selloff is likely a pullback from the 5 bar bull breakout and the odds still favor a bull breakout and second leg up that test the October lows.<li>Traders can argue that February 10 was the second leg for the bulls, and therefore, the requirement of a second leg has been met. However, bulls will likely need a more credible test before traders expect lower prices.<li>The bears have a credible double top with the January and February highs. While it is not likely the bears get a bear breakout below the neckline (January low), if Europe handles the possible Russian invasion of&nbsp;Ukraine poorly, that could be the catalyst for a successful bear breakout and measured move down.<li>Overall, today is important to see how convicted both sides are. The bulls have a possible second leg trap, and if they can get a strong bull signal bar today, it may set up a reasonable stop entry buy for tomorrow. That could lead to a test of the February highs.<li>The bears have a surprise bar with last Friday’s bear breakout and are hopeful it leads to a small second leg down. More likely, we are in a trading range, which means today will likely be disappointing for both the bulls and the bears. &nbsp;</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-double-bottom-higher-low-major-trend-reversal-in-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and double bottom higher low major trend reversal in trading range day\"></a></figure><p><em>Al created the SP500 Emini charts.</em><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>The market had a trading range open that led to a 2nd entry short at bar 6.<li>Bar 7 was a strong enough surprise to lead to a couple of legs down and a wedge bottom.<li>The wedge bottom down to bar 14 was tight, so most traders would wait for a strong bull breakout or a pullback from the breakout, which the bulls got on bar 16 &amp; 20 (double bottom higher low major trend reversal).<li>Next, the bulls were able to rally to the high of the day in the form of consecutive wedge tops and a failed breakout above the prior high at bar 5.<li>Around bar 47, the bears got a bear breakout that led to a new low of the day.<li>The bears were hopeful the bar 47 would lead to a double top and measured move down of the initial range; however, bears bought back shorts below the low of bar 14, &nbsp;and bulls started buying aggressively.<li>Overall, trading range day is important to pay attention to the lack of consecutive big trend bars.

The bulls are hopeful that February 11 is a 50% pullback of the rally from the January low, setting up a higher low major trend reversal and rally up to the January high.<li>The market had a doji close yesterday, which is a bad follow-through for the bears.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-February-18-2022.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-18-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Daily Chart Bulls May Need a Double Bottom Higher Low MTR\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD is deciding if the selloff from the February bull rally is a pullback in what will become a bull trend or the start of a trading range and a possible bear breakout testing the January low.<li>At this moment, the odds favor a test of the February high and a breakout above the double top (January and February highs); however, every added bar lowers the probability of the bulls and increases the odds of more sideways.<li>While the probability does favor the bulls, traders may wait for consecutive bull bars before committing to longs.<li>The bull sees a higher low major trend reversal with February 14 and are currently wondering if the market will have to get down to the February 14 low and form a double bottom higher low major trend reversal.<li>The bears are hopeful that the market has a selloff to the January low and breakout below, followed by a measured move down.

Bar 19 was the biggest looking bear bar late in a selloff, so traders expected exhaustion and a likely test of bar 19.<li>The market formed a credible wedge bottom at the low of the day. It was also a nested wedge bottom with bars (38,44,46) being the third push and a smaller wedge within the large wedge.<li>While the bears were strong during bar 11-19, most of the day looked like a trading range day, so it was reasonable to expect a reversal around bar 41 and a bull rally. Yes, it was a bear trend from bars 6 – 46, but there was a lot of buying pressure from bars 19-46 and during bars, 4-5, increasing the odds of a trading range day forming.<li>The market broke above a wedge top during bar 55, and it led to a two-legged measured move up based on the wedge top that reached the open of the day.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

While the bears may get the market to fall below the January low soon, the odds of them getting a successful breakout below are small. The bears do not seem to have urgency to the downside, and traders will likely look to buy around the January lows, or even above the January lows, anticipating that the market will not fall below it.<p>The bulls understand what the bears are thinking, and they will try and buy aggressively around the January low or slightly above it to prevent a successful bear breakout below the January low. It is important to remember that the market is in a bull trend on the higher time frame, and bull trends constantly look like they are reversing.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is deciding if the rally in early February is strong enough to lead to an upside breakout that will test the October highs. The bears see the February rally as a failed breakout of a trading range and expect a selloff to the January low and possibly a measured move down. If the bears get the measured move down, they would next want a test of the bottom of the 8-year range. The market is in breakout mode, and while the odds favor the bulls, the bears still have a credible case of the market going lower back down to the January lows.<h2 id=\"1-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SP500-Emini-Monthly-Chart-Back-to-back-Consecutive-Outside-Bars.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-20.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Monthly Chart Back-to-back Consecutive Outside Bars\"></a></figure><p><em>Andrew A. created the SP500 Emini and EURUSD charts.</em><ul><li>The candlestick on the monthly Emini chart is a bear inside bar closing on its low. The market has two consecutive OO (Outside – Outside) patterns, the first one back in October.<li>An OO pattern is a breakout mode pattern, which means, in general, the odds are close to 50% for both sides. However, currently, the monthly chart has two topping patterns late in a trend following a buy climax which is why Al has been saying the odds favor the market falling below the January low before going above the January high.<li>Just because the odds favor the market falling below the January low does not mean that the probability is greater than 60%. As stated above, an OO pattern is a breakout mode, so the odds here are slightly greater than 50%, which means the odds are around 55% to maybe 58%. If the market falls below the January low, the selloff would probably last for 2 to 3 months.<li>While the bears are hopeful the market will get a measured move down from the OO pattern or the 7-month trading range, the odds are that any selloff will be brief and will not last much longer than 3 bear bars. Just look at that monthly chart and count the last time the market had 3 consecutive bear bars in a row.<li>November 2011 had 5 bear bars in a row and only led to a 24% correction. Even if the market gets 4 or 5 consecutive bear bars, the odds are it will only lead to a pullback in an overall bull trend, even if the pullback is 20% (it would be a bear trend on the daily chart).<li>If the bears are lucky, they will get a trading range down to the 4000 round number, which would be a little more than a 15% correction.<li>Since the monthly chart is in a small pullback bull trend, the market may pullback 1.5 times more than the largest pullback. September 2020 was the largest pullback, so 1.5 times that would be around 4080, close to a 15% correction.<li>Overall, the odds are that any reversal down will lead to a rally back to the all-time high, and the market will begin to go sideways and form a trading range on the monthly chart.</ul><h3 id=\"3-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SP500-Emini-Weekly-Chart-Lower-High-MTR-Bear-2nd-Leg.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-20-1.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Weekly Chart Lower High MTR Bear 2nd Leg. Emini bears want selloff below January low.\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini candlestick was the entry bar for the stop entry short below last week’s bear bar. However, there is a tail below the bar, and it is within a 7-month trading range and although this is a trend bar, it is a sign of weakness.<li>The bears are hopeful that this selloff over the past two weeks will lead to a lower high major trend reversal (head and shoulders top). The bears want next week to be another strong bear bar. If next week is another bear bar, that would be 3 consecutive bear bars which has not happened since September 2020 and would be another sign of strength.<li>While this may be the start of a 15-20% correction down to the 4000 big round number, it is important to remember that most major trend reversals are minor reversals and should be thought of as continuation patterns.<li>If the market sells off to the January low, it will be a sell vacuum test of the January low and will likely not go far below it.<li>While last week may be a lower high major trend reversal, it is likely not enough bars or a retest of the bull highs to become major. That means that any selloff we get here, even if it is a 15% correction, will likely be a part of the trendline break of the bull trend, and after that, the bulls will need a credible test of the bull highs.<li>Just ask yourself if you are an investor trading the weekly chart, are you all that worried about the January selloff? Of course not, because you would expect the first correction down to lead to a trading range and have a retest of the highs. It is more likely that the rally over the past 2 weeks is theoretically bulls who bought the high close of the weekly chart, bought more above a bull bar like January 28, and got out breakeven on the entire trade, which usually corresponds to a 50% pullback.<li>The point is that even if the market sells off to the 4000 big round number, the bulls will still expect the market to evolve into a trading range, and traders would expect a leg up testing the highs.<li>Overall, traders will pay close attention to the bears’ conviction. If the bears are strong, they will get a third consecutive bear bar, which would increase the probability of the bear selloff below the January lows. More likely, the market will remind traders next week of all the trading range price action over the past 6 months, disappoint the bears, and make the market confusing.<li>As Al has stated several times if Russia invades Ukraine, that could be the catalyst that leads to a 15% correction down to the 4000 big round number.</ul><h3 id=\"4-the-daily-sampp500-emini-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SP500-Emini-Daily-Chart-Lower-High-MTR-Weaker-2nd-Leg.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-20-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart Lower High MTR Weaker 2nd Leg\"></a></figure><ul><li>Friday’s candlestick on the daily Emini chart was a bear bar with a tail below closing slightly below February 14’s low.<li>The tail on Friday’s close is disappointing, and the market may lead to a bounce on Tuesday.<li>Bears do not want to see Friday close below February 14 and the tail below represents hesitation by the bears, which means the bears are taking profits as the market is going lower instead of selling more below lows such as February 14.<li>The bears have sold off to the bottom 1/3 of the trading range (January low to current day).<li>While the bears are hopeful for a bear breakout of the January range, the current selloff looks like a bear leg in a trading range. It also appears to be forming a wedge bottom that is the second leg of a double bottom with the January low.<li>The bulls are hopeful they can get a strong stop entry buy setup for the wedge bottom early next week, leading to a possible breakout of the February highs and a measured move up to top of January – February trading range.<li>As stated above, the odds are the market will not fall far below the January lows due to higher time frames being in a strong bull trend.</ul><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-Weekly-Chart-Bear-Doji-Weak-Bear-Follow-through.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-20-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Weekly Chart Bear Doji Weak Bear Follow-through\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a weak entry bar for the bear reversal bar that formed two weeks ago.<li>The bulls had a strong bull bar following a final flag on February 4; however, they had terrible follow-through on the next bar.<li>The bulls are hopeful that the past two weeks have been a breakout pullback and that the market will lead to an upside breakout.<li>The bears are hopeful that February 11 is a stop entry short that leads to a measured move down and ultimately a test of the 2020 lows. Next, the bears would want a test of the 8-year bottom of the range.<li>If the bears can get a big bear bar closing on its low this week, that would increase the odds of the market reaching the January lows and possibly a measured move down.<li>A channel is a leg in a trading range, which means the market will likely test the October and September highs. The market reached the start of the channel from June 2020 (1.1168) and failed to break below it. The same is likely to happen with the channel’s September or October 2021 start. More likely, the market will continue to go sideways.<li>The above is one of the reasons Al has been saying he expected a rally for several months after the selloff last year. The odds of the rally up to the October lows are higher because of the possible final flag reversal setup from the January failed bear breakout. Most moves form a channel that eventually gets retested, forming a trading range.<li>Lastly, as Al has said, if Europe handles the Russia Ukraine conflict poorly, that could cause a strong bear breakout in the EURUSD.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-eurusd-daily-chart\">The EURUSD<em>daily</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EURUSD-Daily-Chart-Bear-2nd-Leg-50-percent-Pullback.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2022-2-20-4.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Daily Chart Bear 2nd Leg 50 percent Pullback\"></a></figure><ul><li>The candlestick on the daily EURUSD Forex chart was part of a 5-bar tight trading range.<li>The bulls tried for a higher low major trend reversal on February 15.

Traders should be open to a possible failed breakout below the February 14 lows. If the market went below February 14 and reversed up, that would trap weak bulls out who went long on February 15 with a stop below February 14 low. This would stop those bulls out, and also, bears would not be willing to hold short if the market reverses up after falling below February 14.<li>More likely, the market is in a trading range, so traders should expect something confusing and disappointing for both the bulls and the bears. &nbsp;</ul><h2 id=\"8-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
