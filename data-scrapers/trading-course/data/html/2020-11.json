It is therefore a buy signal bar for a double bottom. But because it had a bear body, it is a weak buy setup. There might be more sellers than buyers above its high. But the Emini is oversold and at the support of the bottom of a 3-month trading range. It could therefore bounce at any time. However, the bears will probably sell the 1st 2 to 3-day bounce.<p>On the monthly chart, October was a bear inside bar, and it followed an outside down bar in September. October is therefore a sell signal bar for an ioi breakout mode top.<p>The Emini is at the top of a 3-year trading range and it is now reversing down for the 2nd time in 3 months. The Emini will probably trade below the October low this month, which would trigger the monthly sell signal.<p>This could happen today but that is unlikely. If it does trigger the monthly sell signal this month, the Emini does not have to collapse. But it would increase the chance of a break below the September low, which is the neckline of the September/October double top.<p>The bears want a measured move down, which would be back to the middle of the 3-year trading range, just below 2900. However, when a monthly signal triggers, there is usually a pullback. Traders will decide if the Emini will continue down or reverse up.<p>With all of the trading range trading lately, traders will expect more today. But the location is important. When the market is at major support like the September low, there is always an increased chance of a big trend up or down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 36 points in the Globex session. It will gap far above Friday’s close and it might gap above Friday’s high. A gap above Friday’s high would create a 3-day island bottom, which is a minor buy signal.<p>Since there is a parabolic wedge sell climax on the daily chart, traders should expect at least a couple small legs sideways to up this week. The bears will look for a Low 2 bear flag just below the EMA and then a break below the September low. The bulls want the reversal up to continue to the October 12 lower high and then a new all-time high.<p>Since there is a good sell signal on the monthly chart, today’s buy signal should lead to a minor rally. Traders will then look for a break below the October low in a couple weeks.<p>With the daily chart oversold and at support, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day today. However, Friday had a bear body. That is therefore a weak buy signal bar. Also, there is uncertainty about tomorrow’s US election. That further reduces the chance of a strong rally today. Finally, even when there were big trend days during the 3-week selloff, the Emini spent several hours going sideways. These factors increase the chance of a lot of trading range trading today, even if there is a trend.<p>Can the trend be down? Of course, but if there is a trend today, up is more likely because Friday was a reversal up from a double bottom and a parabolic wedge selloff.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bear-trend-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

But the selloff has had 3 small legs in a tight bear channel. It is therefore a parabolic wedge.<p>Since the today’s reversal attempt is at the September low, there is a wedge bottom forming a double bottom. This is a common reversal pattern. A sell climax typically will lead to profit-taking. There should be at least a couple small legs sideways to up this week.<p>The bears will want them to form a Low 2 bear flag below the EMA. They then want the bear trend to resume and break below the September low. However, the bulls are hoping that the reversal will grow in to a swing up to the October 21 high and then above the September high.<p>Since the 2 week selloff is in an 8-bar bear micro channel and there is a wedge top on the weekly chart, traders ultimately expect a test down to the June 25 high at around 1.14. But the chart has been in a trading range for 3 months. This could continue much longer before there is a breakout in either direction.<p>I mentioned over the weekend that the monthly chart had an ioi pattern and that November would probably trade below the October low. Well, it did overnight, and this triggered a monthly sell signal.<p>When a signal triggers on a higher timeframe, there is an immediate pullback about half the time. This is an example. Then, traders decide if the sell signal will succeed or fail. The weekly chart makes traders believe that the EURUSD will likely work lower for a couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke below the October low, which triggered the monthly ioi sell signal. However, it has been sideways in a 35-pip range. Traders are deciding if the monthly sell signal will succeed or fail.<p>With the overnight range being so small, day traders are scalping reversals up and down for 10 pips. Since the location is very important on the daily chart, there is an increase chance of a trend, which can be up or down. But will so little energy, today will probably remain small.<p>The fight will be over how the day closes. The bulls want today to be a buy signal bar on the daily chart. They therefore want today to close near its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow.<p>The bears, however, want today to close on the low and below the October low. Traders would then expect lower prices tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-doji-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-2-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That made a trading day likely. There was a wedge bottom at yesterday’s close and then a rally back to the open. Today was a doji bar on the daily chart.<p>The bears see today as a double top bear flag with Thursday high. They want a selloff to below last week’s low, which was the October low. That would trigger the ioi sell signal on the monthly chart.<p>However, the Emini is at the bottom of a trading range of the daily chart.

Today will probably gap above yesterday’s high. This will create an island bottom with the gap down from 4 days ago.<p>A big gap up increases the chance of a trend day. Since the Emini is turning up from a sell climax at support on the daily chart, if there is a trend, up is more likely than down.<p>Also, there will be a higher low double bottom with the September low. When the 2nd leg down of a double bottom is a wedge, there is a better chance of at least a couple legs sideways to up.<p>The Emini has been sideways for 3 months. It has been oscillating around the February high of 3361.75. It should get there today or this week. That would close last week’s gap down.<p>Can today be a bear trend day? Yes, but there is currently a 60% chance that the gap up will stay open today, which means that today should be sideways to up. However, if there are several early big bear bars, the odds of a bear trend will go up.<h3>There is still an ioi sell signal on the monthly chart</h3><p>What about the ioi sell signal on the monthly chart? I mentioned that October was a big bar on the monthly chart, and a big bar in an ioi reduces the chance of a reversal down. Therefore, the monthly sell signal is not strong. Even if the sell signal triggers, it will probably only lead to a 1 to 2-month pullback.<p>However, October is also a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the monthly chart. A big bear bar in a buy climax is a weak buy setup. Therefore, if it triggers, it will likely only lead to a 1 – 2 month rally before there is another reversal down.<p>Since the Emini probably will not go up or down much over the next few months, the 3-year trading range should still be in control on the monthly chart. Traders will look for reversals.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap above yesterday’s high. When there is a big gap, there is only a 20% chance of a relentless trend day from the open.<p>The bulls are hesitant to buy too far above the average price (the EMA). But, the bears are usually not eager to sell a gap up opening after a sell climax at support on the daily chart.<p>Most of the time, the 1st leg up or down reverses within the first 30 – 60 minutes and then the Emini enters a trading range. The bulls want to buy a double bottom or wedge bull flag near the EMA. The bears want to sell a double top or a wedge top.<p>If there is a trading range open for the 1st hour or two and then a trend, the trend usually does not last all day. It typically evolves into a trading range late in the day.<p>What happens if there are several consecutive trend bars up or down on the open? That will increase the chance that today will be a relentless trend day. With the Emini oversold at support, traders expect a rally over the next week. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-doji-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-3.png\" alt=\"Emini doji day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That is a common bottom pattern. Traders expect at least a couple small legs sideways to up over the next week or two.<p>The bears hope that the rally will form a bear flag. For example, they would like it to go sideways for a few days and then resume down again from a test of the EMA. If the rally breaks above the EMA, they will then try for a double top with either the October 21 high or the September high.<p>Since the chart has been in a trading range for several months, the bulls will likely be disappointed within a week or so. For example, if the EURUSD goes sideways around the EMA and the October 9 high, there will be a head and shoulders top bear flag. That will give the bears hope again. Right now, traders expect at least slightly higher prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The URUSD Forex market has been rallying strongly overnight on the 5-minute chart. Day traders have been buying for the swing up. Since the range is about average, the bull trend will probably not continue much higher. The bulls will start taking profits. This will result in a 20 – 30-pip pullback.<p>Once the bears see that, they will begin to sell rallies for 10-pip scalps. Also, the bulls will start buying pullbacks instead of buying at the market. With traders buying low and selling high, the bull trend should begin to evolve into a trading range.<p>Can the EURUSD reverse down? It probably will not because the rally is strong. But if the rally stops and the chart begins to go sideways, the bears would have a 30% chance of a reversal down late in the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-to-February-high-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax to February high and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today will probably gap above yesterday’s high. This will create an island bottom with the gap down from 4 days ago.<p>A big gap up increases the chance of a trend day. Since the Emini is turning up from a sell climax at support on the daily chart, if there is a trend, up is more likely than down.<p>Also, there will be a higher low double bottom with the September low. When the 2nd leg down of a double bottom is a wedge, there is a better chance of at least a couple legs sideways to up.<p>The Emini has been sideways for 3 months. It has been oscillating around the February high of 3361.75. It should get there today or this week. That would close last week’s gap down.<p>Can today be a bear trend day? Yes, but there is currently a 60% chance that the gap up will stay open today, which means that today should be sideways to up. However, if there are several early big bear bars, the odds of a bear trend will go up.<h3>There is still an ioi sell signal on the monthly chart</h3><p>What about the ioi sell signal on the monthly chart? I mentioned that October was a big bar on the monthly chart, and a big bar in an ioi reduces the chance of a reversal down. Therefore, the monthly sell signal is not strong. Even if the sell signal triggers, it will probably only lead to a 1 to 2-month pullback.<p>However, October is also a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the monthly chart. A big bear bar in a buy climax is a weak buy setup. Therefore, if it triggers, it will likely only lead to a 1 – 2 month rally before there is another reversal down.<p>Since the Emini probably will not go up or down much over the next few months, the 3-year trading range should still be in control on the monthly chart. Traders will look for reversals.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap above yesterday’s high. When there is a big gap, there is only a 20% chance of a relentless trend day from the open.<p>The bulls are hesitant to buy too far above the average price (the EMA). But, the bears are usually not eager to sell a gap up opening after a sell climax at support on the daily chart.<p>Most of the time, the 1st leg up or down reverses within the first 30 – 60 minutes and then the Emini enters a trading range. The bulls want to buy a double bottom or wedge bull flag near the EMA. The bears want to sell a double top or a wedge top.<p>If there is a trading range open for the 1st hour or two and then a trend, the trend usually does not last all day. It typically evolves into a trading range late in the day.<p>What happens if there are several consecutive trend bars up or down on the open? That will increase the chance that today will be a relentless trend day. With the Emini oversold at support, traders expect a rally over the next week. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-doji-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-3.png\" alt=\"Emini doji day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That is a common bottom pattern. Traders expect at least a couple small legs sideways to up over the next week or two.<p>The bears hope that the rally will form a bear flag. For example, they would like it to go sideways for a few days and then resume down again from a test of the EMA. If the rally breaks above the EMA, they will then try for a double top with either the October 21 high or the September high.<p>Since the chart has been in a trading range for several months, the bulls will likely be disappointed within a week or so. For example, if the EURUSD goes sideways around the EMA and the October 9 high, there will be a head and shoulders top bear flag. That will give the bears hope again. Right now, traders expect at least slightly higher prices.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The URUSD Forex market has been rallying strongly overnight on the 5-minute chart. Day traders have been buying for the swing up. Since the range is about average, the bull trend will probably not continue much higher. The bulls will start taking profits. This will result in a 20 – 30-pip pullback.<p>Once the bears see that, they will begin to sell rallies for 10-pip scalps. Also, the bulls will start buying pullbacks instead of buying at the market. With traders buying low and selling high, the bull trend should begin to evolve into a trading range.<p>Can the EURUSD reverse down? It probably will not because the rally is strong. But if the rally stops and the chart begins to go sideways, the bears would have a 30% chance of a reversal down late in the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-to-February-high-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax to February high and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But the day closed in its middle, like the 3 prior days. This makes the reversal up a little less bullish. However, a reversal up from a sell climax typically has at least a couple legs of sideways to up trading. Traders therefore expect at least slightly higher prices over the next week. This is true regardless of the outcome of the election.<p>The Emini has been oscillating around the February high for 3 months. Yesterday broke above it but closed below it. Today will probably gap up above it.<p>The Emini was sideways for 5 days in late October at around 3450. That is therefore an area of agreement. The 3-day reversal up is probably strong enough to get there again within a few days.<p>Even though the Emini has been in a trading range for 3 months, there are also several factors that increase the chance of a surprisingly big move up or down at any time. The Emini is reversing up from a parabolic wedge sell climax at support on the daily chart. That is bullish. But there is an ioi sell signal on the monthly chart. Also, there is an FOMC meeting tomorrow. And then this is an unusual election, and there will be ugly lawsuits in many states. This will likely end up in the Supreme Court.<p>Traders need to be open to anything this week. But even if today has a lot of trading range trading, the range will probably be big enough for swing trading.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 53 points in the Globex session. There will probably be a big gap up today. When there is a big gap, the Emini is far above the EMA, which is the average price. Bulls do not want to pay far above average unless they are buying very strong bull bars. The bears will sell a strong reversal down. There is only a 20% chance of a strong trend up or down on the open that will last all day.<p>If today is a trend day, up is more likely. Also, it will probably be a weaker type of trend, which means it will probably have at least a couple hours of trading range trading at some point.<p>What is most likely on the open? A big gap usually leads to a trading range for the first couple hours. The bears want to sell a double top or a wedge rally. The bulls want to buy closer to the EMA. They will look for a double bottom or a wedge bottom near the EMA.<p>It is important to note that yesterday’s early rally on the 5-minute chart was a Major Bull Surprise Breakout. That usually leads to follow-through buying for at least a few days. Consequently, traders will look to buy selloffs today. The Emini should work higher.<p>Overnight trading was extremely volatile. There was a big rally, a selloff to a new low, and then a rally back up to the overnight high. That confusion is a sign of balance. It increases the chance of trading range trading. Since a big gap up usually leads to a couple hours of trading range trading, today will likely begin with a trading range.<p>With big bars and big legs overnight, even if today is a trading range day, day traders expect at least one swing trade.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-to-February-high-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-4.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax to February high and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today traded above and below yesterday’s range and is therefore an outside bar.<p>More importantly, it reversed up from below a 2-week parabolic wedge bottom and from below the September low. Traders see this as a potential failed bear breakout.<p>If today closes near the middle of the day’s range or near the high, traders will expect a couple legs sideways to up. If the EURUSD starts to break above the EMA, traders will expect a rally. The minimum goal would be a test of the October 21 lower high.<p>But if the EURUSD goes sideways and is unable to break above the EMA, the bears will try again to break below the September low. The sideways trading will be a bear flag.<p>At the moment, traders need more information. They therefore expect sideways trading at least through tomorrow.<p>Will the EURUSD form some bull days and get above the EMA? Traders would then look for higher prices.<p>Or, will the EURUSD stay sideways for several days and have several bear bodies? Then traders will expect another bear breakout attempt and a move down to the March high, just below 1.15.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has a big range today. It reversed down from above yesterday’s high and then up from below yesterday’s low. It is therefore an outside day on the daily chart.<p>It is now trading around the open of the day. That makes the day a doji bar on the daily chart, which is neutral.<p>Big, Up, Big Down, Big Up creates Big Confusion. Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range. Consequently, there is an increased chance of trading range trading for the remainder of the day. Traders will look for reversals up and buy for 10 to 20-pip scalps. They will also sell reversals down for scalps.<p>Can today enter a sustained trend up or down for the remainder of the session? It probably will not. With today now being a big outside doji bar on the daily chart, it is telling us that traders are exhausted. They will therefore not want to exert themselves again today. Today will probably go sideways around the open and close near the open.<p>But that can always change. If the chart begins to form a series of strong bull or bear bars, traders will switch to swing trading. Sideways is more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-Spike-and-Channel-bull-trend-and-ii-Final-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Spike and Channel bull trend and ii Final Flag\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then entered a tight bull channel. After 3 legs up, it reversed down in an Endless Pullback, which was a Small Pullback Bear Trend. Like the past 4 days, it closed in the middle of the range.<p>When there is a surprisingly big move up, like the past 2 days, many bears are trapped into a bad short, and the bulls who have not bought are trapped out of a great long. That means there are bears and bulls looking to buy the 1st pullback. Consequently, there should be at least a 2nd leg sideways to up after a 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>Will tomorrow continue the pullback? Many bulls have big profits over the past 2 days. They began to take some of those profits in the middle of the day today. That increases the chance of a sideways to down day tomorrow or Friday.<p>Last week was a big bear bar on the weekly chart. Today broke above its high. That should be a magnet tomorrow or Friday. The bulls want the week to close above last week’s high and the bears want it to close below. No matter. The odds favor at least slightly higher prices over the next week or so.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

A big gap usually leads to a trading range for the first couple hours. The bears want to sell a double top or a wedge rally. The bulls want to buy closer to the EMA. They will look for a double bottom or a wedge bottom near the EMA.<p>It is important to note that yesterday’s early rally on the 5-minute chart was a Major Bull Surprise Breakout. That usually leads to follow-through buying for at least a few days. Consequently, traders will look to buy selloffs today. The Emini should work higher.<p>Overnight trading was extremely volatile. There was a big rally, a selloff to a new low, and then a rally back up to the overnight high. That confusion is a sign of balance. It increases the chance of trading range trading. Since a big gap up usually leads to a couple hours of trading range trading, today will likely begin with a trading range.<p>With big bars and big legs overnight, even if today is a trading range day, day traders expect at least one swing trade.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-to-February-high-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-4.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax to February high and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today traded above and below yesterday’s range and is therefore an outside bar.<p>More importantly, it reversed up from below a 2-week parabolic wedge bottom and from below the September low. Traders see this as a potential failed bear breakout.<p>If today closes near the middle of the day’s range or near the high, traders will expect a couple legs sideways to up. If the EURUSD starts to break above the EMA, traders will expect a rally. The minimum goal would be a test of the October 21 lower high.<p>But if the EURUSD goes sideways and is unable to break above the EMA, the bears will try again to break below the September low. The sideways trading will be a bear flag.<p>At the moment, traders need more information. They therefore expect sideways trading at least through tomorrow.<p>Will the EURUSD form some bull days and get above the EMA? Traders would then look for higher prices.<p>Or, will the EURUSD stay sideways for several days and have several bear bodies? Then traders will expect another bear breakout attempt and a move down to the March high, just below 1.15.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has a big range today. It reversed down from above yesterday’s high and then up from below yesterday’s low. It is therefore an outside day on the daily chart.<p>It is now trading around the open of the day. That makes the day a doji bar on the daily chart, which is neutral.<p>Big, Up, Big Down, Big Up creates Big Confusion. Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range. Consequently, there is an increased chance of trading range trading for the remainder of the day. Traders will look for reversals up and buy for 10 to 20-pip scalps. They will also sell reversals down for scalps.<p>Can today enter a sustained trend up or down for the remainder of the session? It probably will not. With today now being a big outside doji bar on the daily chart, it is telling us that traders are exhausted. They will therefore not want to exert themselves again today. Today will probably go sideways around the open and close near the open.<p>But that can always change. If the chart begins to form a series of strong bull or bear bars, traders will switch to swing trading. Sideways is more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-Spike-and-Channel-bull-trend-and-ii-Final-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Spike and Channel bull trend and ii Final Flag\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then entered a tight bull channel. After 3 legs up, it reversed down in an Endless Pullback, which was a Small Pullback Bear Trend. Like the past 4 days, it closed in the middle of the range.<p>When there is a surprisingly big move up, like the past 2 days, many bears are trapped into a bad short, and the bulls who have not bought are trapped out of a great long. That means there are bears and bulls looking to buy the 1st pullback. Consequently, there should be at least a 2nd leg sideways to up after a 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>Will tomorrow continue the pullback? Many bulls have big profits over the past 2 days. They began to take some of those profits in the middle of the day today. That increases the chance of a sideways to down day tomorrow or Friday.<p>Last week was a big bear bar on the weekly chart. Today broke above its high. That should be a magnet tomorrow or Friday. The bulls want the week to close above last week’s high and the bears want it to close below. No matter. The odds favor at least slightly higher prices over the next week or so.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But, like each of the prior 4 days, it closed in the middle of the day’s range.<p>Many bulls are exhausted and have huge profits, and they started to lighten up midday yesterday. While the trend is strongly up, they might take more profits today or tomorrow. That increases the chance of a day or two of sideways to down trading.<p>However, traders will buy the pullback. I mentioned Tuesday morning in the chatroom that the early rally was exceptionally big, and it was therefore a Major Bull Surprise on the 5 minute chart. I said that a major surprise usually is the start of a move that could last at least a few more days. Yesterday was an example of strong follow-through buying.<p>Can today be a 3rd consecutive big bull day? Probably not. As I said, the bulls will start to take some profits. If today rallies early, it should either stall or reverse.<p>Can it be a big bear day? If the profit-taking is aggressive, yes. The rally has been extreme, and that increases the chance of a big down day. The bulls would love to see one! The will buy the 1st 1 to 2-day pullback, and they want to buy as low as possible.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 61 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap far above yesterday’s close and possibly above yesterday’s high. If there is a small gap up on the daily chart, it will probably close in the 1st hour.<p>Big gap openings usually result in trading range price action for the 1st couple hours. The bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bull flag near the EMA. The bears will look to sell a rally to a double top or a wedge rally. An early trading range reduces the chance of a trend that lasts all day.<p>Because of the extreme rally this week, the bulls have big profits. Furthermore, their protective stops are far below. That increases their risk. The easiest way to reduce risk is to take some profits. That reduces the chance of a relentless bull trend today, and it increases the chance of a swing down. The profit taking could last many hours or even all day.<p>Also, there is an FOMC announcement today at 11 am PST. It could lead to a surprisingly big move in either direction, or a strong move and then a reversal. There is usually a sharp move up and down within the 1st few minutes. Consequently, day traders should exit positions ahead of the report and wait about 10 minutes before resuming day trading.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-Spike-and-Channel-bull-trend-and-ii-Final-Flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-5.png\" alt=\"Emini Spike and Channel bull trend and ii Final Flag\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls see this as a double bottom bull flag. Remember, I keep saying that reversals in a trading range are more likely than a successful breakout. This is another example.<p>The 2-day rally has been very strong. It should attract profit-taking today or tomorrow. That could lead to a 50 to 100-pip pullback. However, because the rally has been exceptional, there are many traders who are eager to buy a selloff. This should result in at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>The bulls want a strong breakout above the October 21 lower high and especially above the September 1 top of the 4-month range. If they get 2 closes above the range, traders will look for a test of the next resistance. That is the February 2018 high, above 1.25.<p>Can the EURUSD abruptly reverse down to below yesterday’s low. Probably not. There should be at least a small 2nd leg up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied in a strong bull trend overnight. Because the rally has been parabolic and the day’s range is huge, many bulls will start to take profits. This should result in a 30 to 50-pip pullback within the next couple hours.<p>Once there is a 30 to 50-pip pullback, traders will expect the bull trend to transition into a trading range. At that point, some day traders will also sell rallies. But even after it evolves into a trading range, day traders will still prefer to buy pullbacks over selling rallies for the 1st couple hours.<p>There is an FOMC announcement at 11 am PST today. That can lead to a big move up or down in any financial market. Day traders should exit positions ahead of the report and wait at least 10 minutes before resuming trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day on FOMC day\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After reversing up from a double bottom above yesterday’s high, the Emini stalled again at the bear trend line.<p>Today was an FOMC day the the Emini barely reacted. Despite swings up and down, most of the day was spent in trading ranges.<p>The past 5 days all closed in the middle of their ranges. The 2nd half of the day was a Spike and Channel Bull Trend. At the end of the day, the Emini sold off to the middle of the day’s range and became the 6th consecutive day to close in the middle.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It stalled at the bear trend line from the September and October highs. If it turns down from here, there will be a triangle on the daily chart. However, since it is already in a trading range, it is already in Breakout Mode.<p>With the 5-day strong rally, the odds favor higher prices. But today was the 6th consecutive day that closed near the midpoint of the day’s range. That is a sign of some hesitation.<p>Also, after a strong rally on the daily chart, many bulls will take some profits soon. This could result in a bear day at any point. However, the rally is strong enough so that traders will buy the 1st 1 to 3-day selloff.<p>The rally should continue up to the October 12 lower high. It could even continue to above the September all-time high within a week or so.<p>Today is the last day of the week, so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The most important magnets are last month’s high, which about 20 points above yesterday’s high, and last week’s high of 3430, which might be too far below to reach today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 15 points in the Globex session. After an extreme rally this week, there is an increased chance of some profit-taking today. That could result in either a trading range or a bear trend day.<p>Yesterday was a trading range day. It had a clear double top and a clear double bottom. Because the daily chart is so overbought and at resistance, if there is a break above the double top, there would be an increased chance of a reversal back down.<p>But if there is a bear breakout of yesterday’s range, there is an increased chance that the profit-taking could last all day. That means if today is going to be a trend day, down is slightly more likely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-trading-range-day-on-FOMC-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-6.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day on FOMC day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-outside-up-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-6-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex outside up reversal\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart reversed up from below the bottom of the 7-week tight trading range this week and then above the top. This is a strong reversal. Traders will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback, confident that there will be at least a small 2nd leg up.<p>The momentum up this week has been enough to make a test of the September high likely within a couple weeks. That is the top of the wedge on the weekly chart and the top of the 4-month trading range. If the bulls can get a couple closes above that high, traders will expect the rally to continue to the next resistance. That is the February 2018 high at around 1.25.<p>Since the EURUSD is still in a 4-month trading range, there is still a 50% chance that this rally will fail around the September high. The odds will go up if the rally starts to stall next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly overnight to above last week’s high, and the high of the 7-week trading range. It barely broke above and then has been sideways for a couple hours. That is a sign that it might enter a trading range around last week’s high for the remainder of the day.<p>While day traders have only been buying, there was a 20-pip pullback about an hour ago. That is enough for some day traders to begin to sell reversals down for scalps, betting on a transition to a trading range for the remainder of the day.<p>Last week’s high will probably be a magnet for the rest of the day. The bulls want the week to close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>The bears want today to reverse down. But they would need the week to close at least 20 pips below last week’s high to significantly increase the chance that the EURUSD will stay in the 7-week range.<p>Day traders will continue to buy pullbacks today unless there is a strong reversal down. Since the EURUSD will probably enter a trading range around last week’s high, the bulls will switch to scalping.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-High-2-bottom-and-then-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 bottom and then trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

id=\"0-market-overview-weekend-market-analysis\">Market Overview: Weekend Market Analysis</h2><p>The<strong>SP500 Emini</strong>futures contract has rallied strongly to near the top of a 4-month trading range. Friday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the daily chart. There should be at least a small 2nd leg up, but there might be some profit-taking next week after such an extreme rally. A break to a new high is more likely than a reversal down from a triangle top.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>this week reversed up strongly from a wedge selloff to the bottom of an 8-month trading range. Bonds should work higher for at least a few weeks, even if there is a pullback next week.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex formed an outside bar after an ioi Breakout Mode pattern on the monthly chart. It therefore triggered both the monthly sell and buy signals. Since the rally on the daily chart has been strong this week, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 3-day pullback.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-the-bond-futures-weekly-chart-formed-an-outside-up-bar-at-the-bottom-of-an-8-month-trading-range\">The Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart formed an outside up bar at the bottom of an 8-month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-micro-wedge-and-double-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-7.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has micro wedge and double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures formed an outside up candlestick this week by going below last week’s low and reversing up to above its high. While bullish, the week did not close on its high and therefore was not as bullish as it might have been.<p>That is not a surprise since the bond futures market has been in a trading range for 8 months. Nothing is as bullish or bearish as in trends. Disappointing follow-through and reversals are more common than a leg leading to a successful breakout into a trend.<h3 id=\"3-bonds-should-be-sideways-to-up-for-a-few-weeks\">Bonds should be sideways to up for a few weeks</h3><p>The bond market has been trending down from a lower high for 4 months. However, this week reversed up strongly from just above the June 5 low, which is the bottom of the range. Because this week was a big reversal week, there will probably be some follow-through buying for at least a few weeks.<p>This is especially true since the 4-month selloff had several legs down in a channel. The selloff was therefore a type of wedge. A wedge is a sell climax. A reversal up from a sell climax typically has at least a couple legs sideways to up.<h3 id=\"4-bonds-might-pullback-next-week-before-going-higher\">Bonds might pullback next week before going higher</h3><p>While this week was an outside up week, it might have gone too far, too fast. Many bulls might take some profits next week. This reduces the chance that next week will form a 2nd consecutive bull trend bar on the weekly chart. In fact, if there is sustained profit-taking, next week might even be a bear bar. But at the moment, unless it is a big bear bar, most traders would see it as a pullback from this week’s rally.<p>If next week is an inside bar (high below this week’s high, low above this week’s low), there would then be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. It would then be both a buy and sell signal bar for the following week. But since the bonds are at the bottom of a trading range and this week was a big bull bar, a reversal up from an ioi would be more likely than a continuation down.<h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"6-the-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-an-outside-bar-after-an-ioi-pattern\">The EURUSD<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart has an outside bar after an ioi pattern</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-failed-ioi-sell-signal-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-7-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has failed ioi sell signal\"></a></figure><p>Last month was a bear inside bar after an outside bar. That is an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. This month traded below last month’s low, which triggered the monthly sell signal.<p>But, instead of selling off, the EURUSD reversed up. It then broke above last month’s high. It therefore also triggered the ioi buy signal. November is now an outside up bar.<p>But unless the rally continues to above the high of the ioi, which is the September high, many of the bears who sold below the October low will hold short.<p>Therefore, there is currently both a credible reason to be short or long on the monthly chart. The chart is back in Breakout Mode.<p>The bulls want the month to close above last month’s high. They would especially like November to break above the September high because then the ioi bears would give up. That would increase the chance that the summer rally is resuming.<p>If the bulls can get 2 closes above the September high, the rally will probably continue up to the next target. That is the February 2018 lower high of 1.2555.<h2 id=\"7-the-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-reversing-up-from-a-double-bottom-but-still-in-a-4-month-trading-range\">The EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart is reversing up from a double bottom, but still in a 4-month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-outside-up-bar-and-double-bottom-bull-flag-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-7-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has outside up bar and double bottom bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart has been reversing sharply every week or two for 2 months. After last week’s big bear trend bar, this week formed a big bull trend bar. For the bulls, there is a double bottom bull flag. The bears see the past 6 weeks as a pause after the 1st leg down from a wedge top.<p>Which is it, a bull flag or a bear flag? It’s both! Every trading range always has both a credible buy and sell signal. Trading ranges are neutral. The chart is in Breakout Mode. There is about a 50% chance that the eventual successful breakout will be up and a 50% chance it will be down.<p>The probabilities go up and down, depending on what the chart is currently doing. Since this week reversed up strongly from a double bottom, the odds are slightly higher for a bull breakout.<p>But not much. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will continue to bet on reversals, no matter how strong the legs up and down are. They need to see consecutive closes above or below the 4-month range before concluding that a successful breakout is underway. We don’t have that yet.<h3 id=\"8-eurusd-might-evolve-into-bigger-wedge-top\">EURUSD might evolve into bigger wedge top</h3><p>Even if the bulls get their new high, if the EURUSD then reverses down, there would be a bigger wedge. The EURUSD has been sideways for 4 months. Traders see the current price as fair. If there is a bull breakout that reverses, the 4-month trading range would be a magnet. It would become the final bull flag. The reversal down would probably have at least 2 legs and last about 10 bars. That would be 2 – 3 months on the weekly chart.<h3 id=\"9-strong-week-up-but-still-in-4-month-trading-range\">Strong week up, but still in 4-month trading range</h3><p>So what about next week? After a strong reversal up from a double bottom, traders expect some follow-through buying within a couple weeks. But since this week was big and the EURUSD is now at the top of a 7-week tight trading range, next week might pull back before there is follow-through buying.<p>And even if the bulls break above the 7-week tight trading range, the EURUSD would still be in its 4-month trading range. That means that traders will expect a reversal down from near the top of the range.<h2 id=\"10-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"11-the-monthly-emini-chart-has-an-ioi-breakout-mode-pattern-and-november-is-trying-to-get-a-bull-breakout\">The<strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has an ioi Breakout Mode pattern, and November is trying to get a bull breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-ii-bull-flag-and-expanding-triangle-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-7-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart has ii bull flag and expanding triangle top\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been sideways for 4 months. The past 2 months had big bear bodies.<p>Last month was an inside bar. That means its high was below the September high and its low was above the September low. That is a sign of neutrality. There is now an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. A Breakout Mode pattern is just about neutral. The inside bar is both a buy and sell signal bar for the next month.<p>If November goes below the October low, it will trigger a sell signal. The bears see the 5-month rally as a buy climax and a test of the top of the 3-year trading range. November would then be the 2nd reversal attempt in 3 months. Second signals are higher probability bets. Traders would look for a one- or two-month pullback to the middle of the 3-year trading range.<h3 id=\"12-october-is-a-weak-high-1-bull-flag\">October is a weak High 1 bull flag</h3><p>But what happens if November goes above the October high? That would trigger a High 1 buy signal.<p>However, a bear bar is a weak buy setup, especially when it is a 2nd consecutive bear bar. Also, the 5-month rally was climactic, which means the bulls might take profits soon. Finally, this pattern is at the top of a 3-year trading range. For 3 years, traders thought that the price was fair. If the Emini moves above that fair price range, it will tend to get pulled back into it.<p>Consequently, if November goes above October’s high, there might be more sellers than buyers up there. Unless November is a big bull bar closing near its high, traders will expect that the breakout will probably fail within a couple months. They will look to sell a reversal down.<h2 id=\"13-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-is-reversing-up-from-a-double-bottom-bull-flag\">The<strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is reversing up from a double bottom bull flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-double-bottom-bull-flag-but-possible-triangle-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-7-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart has double bottom bull flag but possible triangle top\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed up strongly this week after last week’s big bear bar. Traders see this as a reversal up from a double bottom with the September low.<p>A strong reversal like this typically has at least some follow-through buying. This is true even though the Emini is now at the resistance at the top of a 4-month trading range.<p>Will the bulls successfully break above the September high and get a 400 point measured move up to 4,000 based on the height of the 4-month trading range? The reversal up is strong enough to give the bulls at least a 50% chance of a new high.<p>However, the Emini is at the top of a 4-month trading range, which is at the top of a 3-year trading range. Trading ranges are magnets. That will tend to limit the extent of a bull breakout. The bulls have a 30% chance of the rally continuing up to 4,000 within the next several months.<h3 id=\"14-trading-ranges-resist-breaking-out\">Trading ranges resist breaking out</h3><p>What is most likely over the next few weeks? Markets have inertia. They tend to continue to do what they have been doing. The Emini is at the top of a 3-year trading range. It is more likely that it will reverse back down into the middle of the range than break far above the range.<p>But there is no top yet and the momentum up is strong. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices over the next few weeks. Also, since this week reversed up strongly from a strong selloff last week, there will probably be at least a small 2nd leg up after the 1st pullback. Consequently, the Emini should be sideways to up for a few weeks, even if it pulls back next week.<h2 id=\"15-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-a-climactic-rally-to-top-of-the-4-month-trading-range\">The<strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a climactic rally to top of the 4-month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-has-strong-rally-to-top-of-trading-range-and-triangle-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-7-5.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini High 1 bull flag on daily chart with strong rally to top of trading range and triangle top\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart rallied sharply from a higher low double bottom with the September 24 low. So far, the 6-day rally has not gone above the October 12 high, which was below the September 2 high.<p>A reversal down over the next few days would create a triangle. Traders would also view a leg down next week as a reversal down from a possible triple top. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. There is better than a 50% chance of a breakout to a new high before there is a breakout below the 4-month trading range.<h3 id=\"16-a-trading-range-is-a-breakout-mode-pattern\">A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern</h3><p>Since the Emini is already in a trading range, which is a Breakout Mode pattern, having it also be in a triangle does not change the math. It only becomes a triangle if there is a 2 to 3-day reversal down next week.<p>It would still be in a Breakout Mode pattern. There is generally about a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout. Also, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout will fail.<p>During the strong legs up and down, the probability is slightly greater for a breakout in the direction of the leg. But not much greater. Look at the strong rally up to the October 12 high. It reversed down. Then look at the collapse down to the October 30 low. It reversed up.<p>The legs in trading ranges always look like they will lead to a successful breakout. But reversals are always more likely, even though there will eventually be a successful breakout.<p>For traders to conclude that a breakout up or down is successful, they want to see a close far above or below the range. They then want a 2nd consecutive trend bar in the same direction also closing beyond the range. Only at that point does the probability go up for a continued breakout<h3 id=\"17-high-1-bull-flag\">High 1 bull flag</h3><p>Friday pulled back below Thursday’s low. It is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for Monday.<p>However, the Emini is at the top of the triangle and failed to break above the bear trend line on Thursday. If it fails again on Monday, the Emini will probably pull back for at least a couple days. If the pullback is mostly sideways, traders will expect a break above the trend line and a test of the all-time high.<p>If instead the Emini triggers the buy by going above Friday’s high, but again fails to get above the bear trend line, Monday could become a sell signal bar for a micro double top and a 4-month triangle top. While that could lead to a week or two of selling, this week’s rally was strong enough to soon get above the bear trend line.<p>There is a 50% chance of a new all-time high in November. But how high can the Emini go? Since it is at the top of a 3-year trading range, it probably will not go more than a few percent higher before pulling back to the middle of the range.<h2 id=\"18-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini raced up 4% to a new high.<p>Will the rally reach 3884.00, the measured move up from the September 24/October 30 double bottom? It might. Traders want today to be a bull day closing near its high.<p>Tomorrow is the follow-through day. At a minimum, they want it to close above the open. That combination would increase the chance of higher prices over the next week. What happens at that point will determine if the rally continues.<p>Traders assume that any breakout, no matter how strong, has a 40 – 50% chance of failing. If today and tomorrow are big bear days, the odds would go up to 60%.<p>As a general rule, a big gap has an increased chance of leading to a trend day. If there is a trend, it will more likely be in the direction of the gap (up, in this case).<p>Huge gaps like this mean that the market has already gone a long way before the market opened. That reduces the chance of the day session becoming a huge bull day. If today is going to be a bull trend day, it will more likely be a smaller bull day. Many traders who are long will see this as a great opportunity to take some windfall profits. The bulls who are not long will want to buy a pullback and will be less willing to buy immediately after such a huge move up. Also, some bears will bet on at least a small pullback and they will begin to scale into shorts.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up more than 4% in the Globex session. Today will therefore gap far above Friday’s high and the all-time September high.<p>For daytraders, today will open far above the 20-bar EMA on the 5-minute chart. Many bulls do not like to buy too far above the average price. That reduces the chance of a strong bull trend day that begins on the open. More often, the Emini will go sideways or even down for a couple hours until it gets closer to the average price. At that point, the bulls will look to buy a double bottom or a wedge bottom.<p>If there is a trading range open, the bears will look to sell a double top or wedge rally. They then will expect to take profits around the EMA.<p>The bears would prefer a Bear Trend From The Open, and not just a selloff that leads to a trading range. If the Emini on the open forms a series of big bear bars closing near their lows, that will increase the chance of today being a bear trend day.<p>But as I said, an early trading range is what is most likely. Therefore, if there is an early selloff, it will probably be weak and soon evolve into a trading range.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-High-2-bottom-and-then-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-9.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 bottom and then trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars.

It has had many strong legs up and down. Trading ranges resist breaking out and therefore traders continue to bet on reversals until there are consecutive closes above or below the range.<p>The 5-day rally has been strong. Traders will probably buy the 1st 1 to 3-day pullback. So far, today is a doji day after Friday’s small break above the September 21 high. This is not a strong breakout. Today could be the start of a brief pullback. But, as I said, the bulls will probably buy it.<p>The bears want today to close near its low. They would then see the 5-day rally as the final leg of an expanding triangle. They want a reversal down. There would also be a double top with the September 21 high.<p>However, legs in trading ranges test nearby resistance. It is therefore more likely that the EURUSD will have to test the September 10 lower high before the bears can begin a 2 to 3-week swing down to the bottom of the range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways in a small trading range overnight. Traders are scalping reversals up or down. If there is a series of big trend bars up or down, day traders will switch to swing trading.<p>There is room to the September 10 lower high, which is a magnet above. Since it is only 10 pips above the overnight high, the EURUSD could easily break above it today. The bulls want today to close far above that resistance today and on the day’s high. That would increase the chance of a break above the September high.<p>However, with Friday stalling at the top of the 7-week range and with today so far being a small day, today will probably continue to be small.<p>The fight will be over the close. If today closes near its high, traders will expect higher prices tomorrow. If today closes near its low, traders will see today as a sell signal bar for at least a 1 – 3-day pullback.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-gap-up-then-selloff-and-bear-trend-resumption-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini gap up then selloff and bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid.

It them sold off. After a weak rally, the bears got trend resumption back down to below the September high, which was the all-time high until today.<p>When a gap is especially big like this, it will attract some profit-taking. This often results in a few sideways days before traders decide if the trend will continue or reverse.<p>Tomorrow will be important. If is it a 2nd big bear day, traders will expect lower prices. However, if tomorrow is a bull day, it will undo today’s damage. Traders will then look for at least slightly higher prices.<p>A gap down on any day this week would create an island top. That would probably result in at least slightly lower prices. At a minimum, the bears want to close the gap above last week’s high.<h2>Vaccine math</h2><p>Pfizer today reported that it’s Covid vaccine is “90% effective.” But what does that mean? They have a phase 3 trial going on with about 44,000 participants. Half received 2 doses of placebo and half got the vaccine. Of the total patients, 94 so far came down with Covid. Their wording is unclear. They said that “fewer than 9” of the Covid cases were in the vaccine group. That means more than 85 were in the placebo group.<p>If the vaccine was totally useless, about 85 of the vaccinated patients should then have gotten Covid as well. Instead, fewer than 9 got infected. There were therefore about 75 fewer than expected, which means the vaccine then prevented 75 of the expected 85 infections. This is about 88% effective and not 90%. Maybe they just rounded up. Or, because the wording in the report is ambiguous and they are reporting 90%, it is probably actually 90%.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini raced up 4% to a new high.<p>Will the rally reach 3884.00, the measured move up from the September 24/October 30 double bottom? It might. Traders want today to be a bull day closing near its high.<p>Tomorrow is the follow-through day. At a minimum, they want it to close above the open. That combination would increase the chance of higher prices over the next week. What happens at that point will determine if the rally continues.<p>Traders assume that any breakout, no matter how strong, has a 40 – 50% chance of failing. If today and tomorrow are big bear days, the odds would go up to 60%.<p>As a general rule, a big gap has an increased chance of leading to a trend day. If there is a trend, it will more likely be in the direction of the gap (up, in this case).<p>Huge gaps like this mean that the market has already gone a long way before the market opened. That reduces the chance of the day session becoming a huge bull day. If today is going to be a bull trend day, it will more likely be a smaller bull day. Many traders who are long will see this as a great opportunity to take some windfall profits. The bulls who are not long will want to buy a pullback and will be less willing to buy immediately after such a huge move up. Also, some bears will bet on at least a small pullback and they will begin to scale into shorts.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up more than 4% in the Globex session. Today will therefore gap far above Friday’s high and the all-time September high.<p>For daytraders, today will open far above the 20-bar EMA on the 5-minute chart. Many bulls do not like to buy too far above the average price. That reduces the chance of a strong bull trend day that begins on the open. More often, the Emini will go sideways or even down for a couple hours until it gets closer to the average price. At that point, the bulls will look to buy a double bottom or a wedge bottom.<p>If there is a trading range open, the bears will look to sell a double top or wedge rally. They then will expect to take profits around the EMA.<p>The bears would prefer a Bear Trend From The Open, and not just a selloff that leads to a trading range. If the Emini on the open forms a series of big bear bars closing near their lows, that will increase the chance of today being a bear trend day.<p>But as I said, an early trading range is what is most likely. Therefore, if there is an early selloff, it will probably be weak and soon evolve into a trading range.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-High-2-bottom-and-then-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-9.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 bottom and then trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

This created a gap up on the daily and weekly charts. However, while the day was up about 1.4%, it was a big bear bar on the daily chart. Many bulls saw the big gap up as an opportunity to take surprisingly big profits. It closed back below the September high, which was the former all-time high.<p>The bears obviously want the breakout to fail. They need one more big bear bar on the daily chart to persuade traders that they can take control.<p>Whenever there is a gap up, traders watch for a gap down over the next week or so. The bears would see that as creating an island top with yesterday’s gap up. That would increase the chance of at least a minor reversal down.<p>The bulls do not want follow-through selling today. They would like today to reverse up early and erase all of yesterday’s selloff. However, yesterday’s late collapse was strong. The bulls will probably need to stop the selling and create a trading range before they can create a trend up.<p>What is most likely after a big gap up and a big reversal down? Big Up, Big Down creates Big Confusion. Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range. There is an increased chance of the Emini being mostly sideways for at least a day or two. Since the 7-day rally was extreme, it might have to go sideways for several days before traders decide whether it will resume up or reverse down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 14 points in the Globex session. It could therefore gap below yesterday’s low. Yesterday would then be a 1-day island top at the all-time high. It could also close the gap up on the weekly chart. But that is not particularly bearish. In this summer’s rally, there were 6 weekly gaps up and 4 quickly closed, yet the rally continued up all summer.<p>While that sounds good for the bears, small gaps usually close in the 1st hour. Also, as I said, the Emini will probably have to go sideways for at least a day before traders decide on the direction of the next move.<p>It has been in a small range overnight. The uncertainty makes a trading range day likely today. There should be at least one swing up and one swing down today.<p>A strong trend day is less likely. Trend traders want to see an early series of trend bars up or down. If they do not get that, traders will expect a trading range day, which is likely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-gap-up-then-selloff-and-bear-trend-resumption-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-10.png\" alt=\"Emini gap up then selloff and bear trend resumption\"></a><figcaption>Emini gap up then selloff and bear trend resumption</figcaption></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday reversed down in an outside down day. The bears see yesterday as a failed breakout above the September 10 high. They want this to be a double top and an Expanding Triangle top. The odds of a reversal down will go up if today is a 2nd consecutive big bear day closing near its low.<p>But the 4-day rally was strong. The bulls should get at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up this week. They want today to have a bull body. It would then be a better High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Everyone knows that there will eventually be a successful breakout of the 4-month trading range. In a trading range, reversals are always more likely. There have been many strong legs up and down for 4 months and each has reversed.<p>There is currently no reason to believe that the current rally will lead to a breakout above the September 1 high, or a reversal down will successfully break below the November 4 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small range overnight. Since yesterday was an outside-down day at resistance, it is a sell signal bar for today. Today traded below yesterday’s low, which triggered the sell signal.<p>However, it only dipped slightly below that low before reversing up. This so far is a weak sell signal on the daily chart.<p>But the reversal up was weak as well. Traders are deciding if the EURUSD will reverse down from resistance or have at least a small 2nd leg up after a 4-day rally.<p>Today will help them to decide. If today collapses, then traders will conclude that the EURUSD will head down. But if it does not, traders will expect at least a small bounce up this week to again test the September 10 high.<p>With the small overnight range, day traders have been scalping up and down. The fight today will be over today’s open and yesterday’s low. The bulls want today to have a bull body. That will increase the number of traders who will buy tomorrow. But if today has a bear body and closes below yesterday’s low, traders will look for at least slightly lower prices tomorrow.<p>Can today break into a trend? Yes, but since it triggered a sell signal and did not collapse or reverse up strongly, today will probably remain small and sideways.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-parabolic-wedges-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedges and trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini then reversed up from a wedge bottom and a 2nd test of last week’s high. After a Low 4 rally to a new high, the Emini entered a trading range.<p>Today is a buy signal bar on the daily chart for a pullback below the September high. But because it was not a big bull bar closing on its high and yesterday was a big bear day, this is a minor buy setup. The Emini might have to go sideways for at least one more day before the bulls will be eager to buy again. They might want a micro double bottom.<p>The bears hope that yesterday was a failed breakout of the 4-month trading range and the start of a bear trend. It is important to note that yesterday made a new all-time high but closed below the old high. With the strong 7-day rally, this is probably a minor reversal down. The bears will need at least another big bear day before traders start to look at this as a reversal instead of a pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There have been many strong legs up and down for 4 months and each has reversed.<p>There is currently no reason to believe that the current rally will lead to a breakout above the September 1 high, or a reversal down will successfully break below the November 4 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small range overnight. Since yesterday was an outside-down day at resistance, it is a sell signal bar for today. Today traded below yesterday’s low, which triggered the sell signal.<p>However, it only dipped slightly below that low before reversing up. This so far is a weak sell signal on the daily chart.<p>But the reversal up was weak as well. Traders are deciding if the EURUSD will reverse down from resistance or have at least a small 2nd leg up after a 4-day rally.<p>Today will help them to decide. If today collapses, then traders will conclude that the EURUSD will head down. But if it does not, traders will expect at least a small bounce up this week to again test the September 10 high.<p>With the small overnight range, day traders have been scalping up and down. The fight today will be over today’s open and yesterday’s low. The bulls want today to have a bull body. That will increase the number of traders who will buy tomorrow. But if today has a bear body and closes below yesterday’s low, traders will look for at least slightly lower prices tomorrow.<p>Can today break into a trend? Yes, but since it triggered a sell signal and did not collapse or reverse up strongly, today will probably remain small and sideways.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-parabolic-wedges-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedges and trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>Today sold off on the open from a double top, and closed the gap on the weekly chart. The Emini then reversed up from a wedge bottom and a 2nd test of last week’s high. After a Low 4 rally to a new high, the Emini entered a trading range.<p>Today is a buy signal bar on the daily chart for a pullback below the September high. But because it was not a big bull bar closing on its high and yesterday was a big bear day, this is a minor buy setup. The Emini might have to go sideways for at least one more day before the bulls will be eager to buy again. They might want a micro double bottom.<p>The bears hope that yesterday was a failed breakout of the 4-month trading range and the start of a bear trend. It is important to note that yesterday made a new all-time high but closed below the old high. With the strong 7-day rally, this is probably a minor reversal down. The bears will need at least another big bear day before traders start to look at this as a reversal instead of a pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It did not close at a new all-time high.<p>The selloff fell to below last week’s high. That closed the gap on the weekly chart. But gaps are minor patterns. A closed gap in a bull trend is not important. Look at the weekly chart this summer. There was a strong rally, even though there were 3 gaps up that closed before the week ended.<p>Traders are deciding if Monday was a failed breakout of the 4-month trading range or just the start of a brief pullback. Unless the bears get more big bear bars, traders expect higher prices.<p>The 7-day rally was extreme, as was Monday’s reversal down. Big Up, Big Down creates Big Confusion, and confusion usually results in at least a small trading range. Therefore, the Emini might have to go sideways for another day or two, and possibly longer, before the bulls will buy for another leg up.<p>Yesterday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. But it was not a big bull bar closing on its high, and it followed a big bear bar. This is therefore a weak high 1 buy signal. The Emini might go more sideways than up for a few days. Also, with the bond market closed today, there will be less financial information. This will take away one force that could lead to a trend.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap above yesterday’s high. That would trigger a buy signal on the daily chart.<p>But with yesterday being only a small bull day and Monday being a big bear day, this is not a strong buy setup. That reduces the chance of today being a big bull day. Also, yesterday had a lot of trading range trading, and the bond market is closed today. These factors increase the chance of more trading range trading today.<p>I mentioned that Monday broke to a new all-time high, but closed below the September high. Today will open around the September high. That high could be a magnet today. The bulls want the 2-week rally to close at a new high today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-parabolic-wedges-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-11.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedges and trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There have been many strong legs up and down, but each has led to a reversal instead of a trend.<p>It is now turning down from a double top lower high and expanding triangle with the September 10 high. The bears want a test of the bottom of the range and then a breakout below the range. The bulls believe that last week’s rally was strong enough to have at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. But they need this selloff to stop today or tomorrow and reverse back up.<p>This is the decision that traders repeatedly make in a trading range. Is a reversal simply a pullback from a strong leg that will lead to at least a small 2nd leg? Or, will the pullback grow into a reversal that will test the opposite side of the range?<p>If the bears get one more bear day tomorrow, the odds will shift in favor of a reversal down to the November low. But if today or tomorrow reverses back up, traders will continue to expect a test of Monday’s high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off strongly overnight. But the selloff has been in a parabolic wedge and it is climactic. That typically will attract profit takers, which usually will end the bear trend and begin a trading range or a reversal.<p>So far, day traders have only been selling for swing trades. But the selling should soon attract profit-taking.<p>If there is one more new low and then another reversal, the sell climax will have 3 legs. Traders will then look to buy a reversal up. If there is a reversal up from a strong bear trend, it usually will lead to a trading range for 20 or more bars. At that point, the bulls will have a better chance of a reversal up into a trend.<p>At the moment, traders expect a minor new low and then profit-taking. That should lead to a trading range, possibly for the remainder of the day. If so, day traders will switch to scalping longs and shorts.<p>Can the collapse continue all day? When the selloff looks like this, it usually attracts profit-taking and converts into a trading range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-double-bottom-and-new-all-time-highest-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and new all time highest close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini gapped up, which triggered the weak High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. It sold off briefly to below yesterday’s high and then rallied for the 1st half of the day. It then reversed down from exactly at the September 2 high, which was the all-time high until Monday.<p>After selling off to a new low, Emini bounced back to close near the high, just below the September 2 high. However, the Emini made a new all-time highest close by closing just above the September 2 close.<p>Traders are still deciding if Monday’s reversal down from above the September high will be the high of the year, or if this week is just a pullback in a bull trend. The odds favor a resumption of the bull trend, but traders need more information. They should get it over the next several days.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls want the 2-week rally to close at a new high today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-parabolic-wedges-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-11.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedges and trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There have been many strong legs up and down, but each has led to a reversal instead of a trend.<p>It is now turning down from a double top lower high and expanding triangle with the September 10 high. The bears want a test of the bottom of the range and then a breakout below the range. The bulls believe that last week’s rally was strong enough to have at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. But they need this selloff to stop today or tomorrow and reverse back up.<p>This is the decision that traders repeatedly make in a trading range. Is a reversal simply a pullback from a strong leg that will lead to at least a small 2nd leg? Or, will the pullback grow into a reversal that will test the opposite side of the range?<p>If the bears get one more bear day tomorrow, the odds will shift in favor of a reversal down to the November low. But if today or tomorrow reverses back up, traders will continue to expect a test of Monday’s high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off strongly overnight. But the selloff has been in a parabolic wedge and it is climactic. That typically will attract profit takers, which usually will end the bear trend and begin a trading range or a reversal.<p>So far, day traders have only been selling for swing trades. But the selling should soon attract profit-taking.<p>If there is one more new low and then another reversal, the sell climax will have 3 legs. Traders will then look to buy a reversal up. If there is a reversal up from a strong bear trend, it usually will lead to a trading range for 20 or more bars. At that point, the bulls will have a better chance of a reversal up into a trend.<p>At the moment, traders expect a minor new low and then profit-taking. That should lead to a trading range, possibly for the remainder of the day. If so, day traders will switch to scalping longs and shorts.<p>Can the collapse continue all day? When the selloff looks like this, it usually attracts profit-taking and converts into a trading range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-double-bottom-and-new-all-time-highest-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and new all time highest close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini gapped up, which triggered the weak High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. It sold off briefly to below yesterday’s high and then rallied for the 1st half of the day. It then reversed down from exactly at the September 2 high, which was the all-time high until Monday.<p>After selling off to a new low, Emini bounced back to close near the high, just below the September 2 high. However, the Emini made a new all-time highest close by closing just above the September 2 close.<p>Traders are still deciding if Monday’s reversal down from above the September high will be the high of the year, or if this week is just a pullback in a bull trend. The odds favor a resumption of the bull trend, but traders need more information. They should get it over the next several days.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday’s close was just above the September 2 close, and therefore it was a new all-time highest close. The bulls need follow-through buying over the next few days, or the bears will get a lower high and a 2nd leg down.<p>The bears want Monday to remain the high for the rest of the year. But they need several big bear bars before traders will believe that the high is in.<p>When the market is deciding between a bull flag and a bear trend reversal, it sometimes will go sideways for several days. The trading range can even last several weeks before either the bull trend resumes or the bear trend has another leg down.<p>The past 2 days were small. That means traders lack conviction. They want to see more and bigger bull bars, or more and bigger bear bars before they will bet on the direction of the next move. In the meantime, day traders will expect mostly sideways trading, like the past 2 days. However, with a strong 2-week rally to a new high, the odds favor higher prices soon.<h3>Bullish time of the year</h3><p>This is a bullish time of the year and the bulls had a very strong rally last week. The odds favor sideways to up trading over the next week or two, and possibly into the end of the year.<p>But if the bears can prevent the rally for a couple weeks, traders will begin to wonder if the high is in for the year. This could result in bulls exiting their longs, which would result in a move back to the middle of the 4-month trading range.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 10 points in the Globex session. Today is Thursday and the Emini is in the middle of the weekly range and at the September 2 prior all-time high. After Monday’s strong reversal down and now 2 sideways days, today will probably not be a big bull day. But the bulls would like the week to close above its midpoint and above the September 2 high. They can achieve both with trading range days and therefore do not need a big bull day.<p>The bears want the opposite. While they would like the week to close on its low, they would be satisfied with today, and tomorrow closing below the September 2 high and near the low of the day. That would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices next week.<p>After Monday’s big reversal down from a buy climax and 2 small sideways days, today will probably be a trading range day. But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, day traders will hold onto early positions as long as the trend lasts.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-double-bottom-and-new-all-time-highest-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-12.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and new all time highest close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The rally barely broke above the September 10 lower high. It was strong enough for traders to expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>The bulls want a breakout above the September 1 high, which is the top of the range. Since most breakout attempts fail, the odds are that this rally will fail to get much above that high, if it gets above that high.<p>This 3-day selloff looks more like a bull flag than a bear trend reversal. It lacks consecutive big bear bars; yesterday closed in its middle; last week’s rally was strong and, today tested yesterday’s low and reversed up. These factors make traders expect a 2nd test of this week’s high within a week.<p>It is still possible that this is the start of a reversal down from a double top with the September 10 lower high. If the selloff continues for a few more days and has bear bars closing on their lows, then it will probably continue down to the November 4 low. Without that, traders will continue to expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reverse up from a test down to just above yesterday’s low. But the rally failed to get above yesterday’s high.<p>Today so far is a bull inside day. If it closes above its midpoint, traders will see it as a buy signal bar for tomorrow. If not, traders will expect a 4th sideways day tomorrow.<p>As strong as the overnight rally was, the EURUSD retraced about half and it fell more than 30 pips from the overnight high. That increases the chance of a trading range. Day traders will look to buy selloffs, sell rallies, and take quick profits.<p>The bulls would like a strong bull trend day. But they do not need it. All they really need is for today to be a good buy signal bar for tomorrow. The more today closes near its high, the higher the probability will be that last week’s rally is resuming. If today reverses back down to the low of the day, traders will expect more sideways to down trading tomorrow.<p>With the past 4 days all having prominent tails on the daily chart and the past 3 days being sideways, traders see the EURUSD as fairly neutral. That reduces the chance of today closing on the high or low of the day. The fight will be over the size and direction of the body.<p>The reversal up overnight makes today likely to have a bull body. If the bulls are strong enough to get today to close near the high of the day, traders will be more willing to buy tomorrow, looking for a resumption of last week’s rally.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini then broke strongly to the downside. It then entered a lower trading range and formed a bear Trending Trading Range Day.<p>There is a 60-minute tight trading range just below 3500 from last week. That is a good candidate for a Final Bull Flag. It is therefore a magnet below. The Emini might have to test the bottom of that range, which was last Friday’s low, before the bulls will consider buying aggressively again.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important.

Yesterday’s close was just above the September 2 close, and therefore it was a new all-time highest close. The bulls need follow-through buying over the next few days, or the bears will get a lower high and a 2nd leg down.<p>The bears want Monday to remain the high for the rest of the year. But they need several big bear bars before traders will believe that the high is in.<p>When the market is deciding between a bull flag and a bear trend reversal, it sometimes will go sideways for several days. The trading range can even last several weeks before either the bull trend resumes or the bear trend has another leg down.<p>The past 2 days were small. That means traders lack conviction. They want to see more and bigger bull bars, or more and bigger bear bars before they will bet on the direction of the next move. In the meantime, day traders will expect mostly sideways trading, like the past 2 days. However, with a strong 2-week rally to a new high, the odds favor higher prices soon.<h3>Bullish time of the year</h3><p>This is a bullish time of the year and the bulls had a very strong rally last week. The odds favor sideways to up trading over the next week or two, and possibly into the end of the year.<p>But if the bears can prevent the rally for a couple weeks, traders will begin to wonder if the high is in for the year. This could result in bulls exiting their longs, which would result in a move back to the middle of the 4-month trading range.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 10 points in the Globex session. Today is Thursday and the Emini is in the middle of the weekly range and at the September 2 prior all-time high. After Monday’s strong reversal down and now 2 sideways days, today will probably not be a big bull day. But the bulls would like the week to close above its midpoint and above the September 2 high. They can achieve both with trading range days and therefore do not need a big bull day.<p>The bears want the opposite. While they would like the week to close on its low, they would be satisfied with today, and tomorrow closing below the September 2 high and near the low of the day. That would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices next week.<p>After Monday’s big reversal down from a buy climax and 2 small sideways days, today will probably be a trading range day. But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, day traders will hold onto early positions as long as the trend lasts.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-double-bottom-and-new-all-time-highest-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-12.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and new all time highest close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-pullback-from-rally-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-12-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex pullback from rally in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart pulled back for 3 days after a strong 4-day rally. The rally barely broke above the September 10 lower high. It was strong enough for traders to expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>The bulls want a breakout above the September 1 high, which is the top of the range. Since most breakout attempts fail, the odds are that this rally will fail to get much above that high, if it gets above that high.<p>This 3-day selloff looks more like a bull flag than a bear trend reversal. It lacks consecutive big bear bars; yesterday closed in its middle; last week’s rally was strong and, today tested yesterday’s low and reversed up. These factors make traders expect a 2nd test of this week’s high within a week.<p>It is still possible that this is the start of a reversal down from a double top with the September 10 lower high. If the selloff continues for a few more days and has bear bars closing on their lows, then it will probably continue down to the November 4 low. Without that, traders will continue to expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reverse up from a test down to just above yesterday’s low. But the rally failed to get above yesterday’s high.<p>Today so far is a bull inside day. If it closes above its midpoint, traders will see it as a buy signal bar for tomorrow. If not, traders will expect a 4th sideways day tomorrow.<p>As strong as the overnight rally was, the EURUSD retraced about half and it fell more than 30 pips from the overnight high. That increases the chance of a trading range. Day traders will look to buy selloffs, sell rallies, and take quick profits.<p>The bulls would like a strong bull trend day. But they do not need it. All they really need is for today to be a good buy signal bar for tomorrow. The more today closes near its high, the higher the probability will be that last week’s rally is resuming. If today reverses back down to the low of the day, traders will expect more sideways to down trading tomorrow.<p>With the past 4 days all having prominent tails on the daily chart and the past 3 days being sideways, traders see the EURUSD as fairly neutral. That reduces the chance of today closing on the high or low of the day. The fight will be over the size and direction of the body.<p>The reversal up overnight makes today likely to have a bull body. If the bulls are strong enough to get today to close near the high of the day, traders will be more willing to buy tomorrow, looking for a resumption of last week’s rally.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini then broke strongly to the downside. It then entered a lower trading range and formed a bear Trending Trading Range Day.<p>There is a 60-minute tight trading range just below 3500 from last week. That is a good candidate for a Final Bull Flag. It is therefore a magnet below. The Emini might have to test the bottom of that range, which was last Friday’s low, before the bulls will consider buying aggressively again.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. That includes last week’s high, the October 12 high, and last Friday’s low.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bears want follow-through selling today, while the bulls want a reversal up.<p>The Emini might have to reach the November 6 low within the next few days. On the 60-minute chart, that is the bottom of a 2-day tight trading range. It is therefore a reasonable candidate for a Final Bull Flag on the 60-minute chart. That makes it an important magnet below. If the Emini gets there, traders will look for at least a day or two bounce.<p>The bulls want today to reverse up from a micro double bottom with Tuesday’s low. Despite the bear body yesterday, there was a big tail below the bar, representing late buying. This was a 2nd reversal up from a test of the October 12 high. That was the breakout point for last week’s rally. The bulls hope that the bull trend will resume today after yesterday’s test. However, the bear body and Monday’s selloff make more sideways to down likely before the bulls get a new high.<p>Traders are deciding if this week will be the high of the year or just a pullback in a strong bull trend. At the moment, the bull case is slightly more likely. However, a couple big bear days could shift the probability in favor of the bears.<h3>Weekly support and resistance</h3><p>Today is the final day of the week. Therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<p>The bears want the week to close on the low of the week. That would be below last week’s high and the September all-time high. It would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices next week.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the October 12 high, which was the breakout point for last week’s rally. They want this selloff to be simply a pullback to test that breakout point.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open near the top of its 3-day trading range and back above the 20-bar EMA on the 60-minute chart.<p>Markets tend to continue to do what they have been doing. Most of the trading has been sideways for 3 days. Day traders expect more today, especially since yesterday is a weak buy signal bar on the daily chart. Also, 9 of the past 11 days closed either in the middle of the day’s range or near the open of the day. It is reasonable to assume that today will follow that pattern.<p>A trend day can come at any time. If there is a series of strong trend bars early in the day in either direction, traders will look for a trend. Without that, they will continue to look for reversals.<p>However, even if today is again mostly sideways, the average daily range has been big. Day traders have had swing trades every day, despite lots of sideways trading.<p>Remember, today is Friday so weekly magnets can be important, especially in the final hour. The most important ones are last week’s high, the October 12 high, and the midpoint of the week’s range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-13.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls see this as a High 1 bull flag. After last week’s strong rally, they expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>While they would like the rally to continue to far above the September 1 high, they know that most strong legs in a trading range reverse. They therefore need a strong rally soon and consecutive closes above the September high. Otherwise, they will give up and the EURUSD will reverse down from the top of the range, as it has many times before.<p>The bears know that there will probably be a test of Monday’s high before there is a swing down to the middle or low of the trading range. But, they hope that the reversal down began on Monday. However, in the absence of consecutive bear bars closing near their lows, it is more likely that there will have to be at least a micro double top before there is a test of the bottom of the range.<p>The probability favors at least a test up to around the November 9 high. However, until there are a couple closes above or below the 4-month trading range, traders will continue to look for reversals every week or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high overnight. This triggered a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. However, it reversed back down below yesterday’s high and the top of the 4-day tight trading range. It has been mostly sideways with a slightly bullish bias all night.<p>Day traders see today as a trading range day. They have been scalping up and down for 10 pips. Because today triggered a buy signal on the daily chart and the reversal down so far has formed a higher low, the day is slightly more bullish than bearish. The bulls want today to accelerate up and become a big bull trend day. That is unlikely at the moment. Alternatively, they want today to close above yesterday’s high. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices on Monday.<p>The bears want the reversal down from above yesterday’s high to continue to below yesterday’s low. Today would then be an outside down day. That would increase the chance of lower prices on Monday. Alternatively, they want today to close below the open. Today would then have a bear body. At a minimum, they want today to close below yesterday’s high.

The bears want follow-through selling today, while the bulls want a reversal up.<p>The Emini might have to reach the November 6 low within the next few days. On the 60-minute chart, that is the bottom of a 2-day tight trading range. It is therefore a reasonable candidate for a Final Bull Flag on the 60-minute chart. That makes it an important magnet below. If the Emini gets there, traders will look for at least a day or two bounce.<p>The bulls want today to reverse up from a micro double bottom with Tuesday’s low. Despite the bear body yesterday, there was a big tail below the bar, representing late buying. This was a 2nd reversal up from a test of the October 12 high. That was the breakout point for last week’s rally. The bulls hope that the bull trend will resume today after yesterday’s test. However, the bear body and Monday’s selloff make more sideways to down likely before the bulls get a new high.<p>Traders are deciding if this week will be the high of the year or just a pullback in a strong bull trend. At the moment, the bull case is slightly more likely. However, a couple big bear days could shift the probability in favor of the bears.<h3>Weekly support and resistance</h3><p>Today is the final day of the week. Therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<p>The bears want the week to close on the low of the week. That would be below last week’s high and the September all-time high. It would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices next week.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the October 12 high, which was the breakout point for last week’s rally. They want this selloff to be simply a pullback to test that breakout point.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open near the top of its 3-day trading range and back above the 20-bar EMA on the 60-minute chart.<p>Markets tend to continue to do what they have been doing. Most of the trading has been sideways for 3 days. Day traders expect more today, especially since yesterday is a weak buy signal bar on the daily chart. Also, 9 of the past 11 days closed either in the middle of the day’s range or near the open of the day. It is reasonable to assume that today will follow that pattern.<p>A trend day can come at any time. If there is a series of strong trend bars early in the day in either direction, traders will look for a trend. Without that, they will continue to look for reversals.<p>However, even if today is again mostly sideways, the average daily range has been big. Day traders have had swing trades every day, despite lots of sideways trading.<p>Remember, today is Friday so weekly magnets can be important, especially in the final hour. The most important ones are last week’s high, the October 12 high, and the midpoint of the week’s range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-13.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-High-1-bull-flag-but-expanding-triangle-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-13-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex High 1 bull flag but expanding triangle top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been sideways for 4 days after pulling back from a small breakout above the September 10 high. The bulls see this as a High 1 bull flag. After last week’s strong rally, they expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>While they would like the rally to continue to far above the September 1 high, they know that most strong legs in a trading range reverse. They therefore need a strong rally soon and consecutive closes above the September high. Otherwise, they will give up and the EURUSD will reverse down from the top of the range, as it has many times before.<p>The bears know that there will probably be a test of Monday’s high before there is a swing down to the middle or low of the trading range. But, they hope that the reversal down began on Monday. However, in the absence of consecutive bear bars closing near their lows, it is more likely that there will have to be at least a micro double top before there is a test of the bottom of the range.<p>The probability favors at least a test up to around the November 9 high. However, until there are a couple closes above or below the 4-month trading range, traders will continue to look for reversals every week or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high overnight. This triggered a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. However, it reversed back down below yesterday’s high and the top of the 4-day tight trading range. It has been mostly sideways with a slightly bullish bias all night.<p>Day traders see today as a trading range day. They have been scalping up and down for 10 pips. Because today triggered a buy signal on the daily chart and the reversal down so far has formed a higher low, the day is slightly more bullish than bearish. The bulls want today to accelerate up and become a big bull trend day. That is unlikely at the moment. Alternatively, they want today to close above yesterday’s high. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices on Monday.<p>The bears want the reversal down from above yesterday’s high to continue to below yesterday’s low. Today would then be an outside down day. That would increase the chance of lower prices on Monday. Alternatively, they want today to close below the open. Today would then have a bear body. At a minimum, they want today to close below yesterday’s high. That would reduce the chances of a strong rally on Monday.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, it has been in a tight trading range for 8 months after the most extreme buy climax in history. I have been saying since the March climactic reversal down that the bond market would be sideways for a long time, and possibly a year or more. So far, this has been correct.<p>This week reversed up from the bottom of the 8-month trading range. There is now a double bottom with the June low. The location is good for the bulls, but the buy signal bar and the tight bear channel are not.<p>This week was not a big bull bar closing on its high. Traders do not see it as a strong buy signal bar for next week.<p>Additionally, the 4-month bear channel has been tight. A breakout above a tight bear channel usually leads to a trading range and not a bull trend. Therefore, if the bond market works higher over the next few weeks, it will probably stall around the September lower high, which is in the middle of the 8-month trading range.<h3 id=\"3-rates-will-go-much-higher-but-when\">Rates will go much higher, but when?</h3><p>Everyone knows that there will eventually be a breakout of the trading range. I have been saying that the bond market will be lower 5 years from now, which means interest rates will be higher. But it could still test the August high or even the March high in the meantime.<p>If it was clearly on the way down to the November 2019 low at the bottom of the final buy climax, it would not still be in the 8-month range. Until there are a couple closes below the June low or above the August high, traders will continue to bet on reversals. Since it is reversing up from the bottom of the range, traders expect at least slightly higher prices next week.<h2 id=\"4-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-weekly-chart-has-been-reversing-every-week-in-an-8-week-tight-trading-range\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart has been reversing every week in an 8-week tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-ihas-bear-bar-at-top-of-Tight-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-14-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart ihas bear bar at top of Tight trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the weekly chart has been sideways for 4 months. It rallied strongly this summer, but the bull channel had 3 legs. It was therefore a wedge buy climax. Traders then expected the rally to go sideways to down for a couple legs and 10 or more bars (weeks), and it has.<p>The wedge also formed a double top with the September 2018 high. That was the start of a 2-year bear channel. When there is a reversal up from a bear channel, a market typically stalls at around the start of the channel, and then the chart converts into a trading range. This is what has been happening on the weekly EURUSD chart. The 4 months of sideways trading has had a couple sideways legs and it lasted about 10 bars. That meets the minimum expectations.<h3 id=\"6-8-week-tight-trading-range-is-a-limit-order-market\">8-week tight trading range is a limit order market</h3><p>At this point, the bulls are looking to buy. But there is no clear buy setup yet. The past 8 weeks have been in a tight trading range and the bars have been big. The market has been reversing almost every week. That is bad for traders looking for a trend.<p>A tight trading range is a limit order market. That means there are typically more sellers than buyers above, and more buyers than sellers below. It is a low-probability environment for stop entry traders, who are hoping for a breakout into a trend. Also, the big bars mean the stop is going to be far away. That results in bad risk/reward for stop entry traders.<h3 id=\"7-4-month-trading-range-is-breakout-mode\">4-month trading range is Breakout Mode</h3><p>The strong summer rally broke above the March high and the June 10 high. Once a chart evolves into a trading range, there is usually a dip below the breakout points. Traders are wondering if the 4-month pullback will work down to the June 10 high, or if the bulls will get another leg up first.<p>Once a trading range has about 20 bars, the probability of a successful bear breakout is about the same as for a bull breakout. That is a Breakout Mode market.<p>If the bulls get a successful breakout, they would like it to reach the February 2018 high at around 1.25. If instead it reversed down before reaching that target, there would then be a bigger wedge rally. The 1st leg up would be to the March 9 high and the 2nd leg would have ended on September 1. A bigger wedge should lead to a bigger reversal. The target again would be the June 10 high.<h3 id=\"8-what-is-likely-over-the-next-few-weeks\">What is likely over the next few weeks?</h3><p>Markets have inertia. They tend to continue doing what they have been doing. Traders will therefore bet on reversals over the next few weeks until there are a couple consecutive big bull bars closing above the September high or a couple big bear bars closing below the November low.<p>Also, a trading range is an area of agreement. If the bulls get a breakout above the September high, it will more likely reverse back into the range before reaching the February 2018 high.<p>Additionally, if the bears get their breakout, the selloff will probably not continue down to the March low. Instead, the EURUSD would likely get pulled back up into the trading range within a month or two.<h2 id=\"9-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"10-monthly-emini-chart-is-breaking-above-a-weak-high-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart is breaking above a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SP500-Emini-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-is-breaking-above-weak-ioi-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-14-2.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini futures monthly candlestick chart is breaking above weak ioi bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had an inside bar last month in a bull trend. October was therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>But it had a big bear body and it followed a big bear bar in September. That is a weak buy signal. There will probably be sellers not too far above the October high.<p>While the rally might last another month or two, it is unlikely to continue up strongly from here. Traders should expect a deeper pullback to begin within the next few months. Because the rally has been climactic, there will probably be a couple legs sideways to down and lasting at least 4 – 6 months. That means that the Emini will probably be in a trading range for the 1st half of next year, and it is now likely near the top of the range. It could last longer, but that is a reasonable expectation at this point.<p>What happens if November and December are both big bull bars closing on their highs? That would be a bull surprise, and a surprise usually has at least a small 2nd leg up. The bulls currently have a 40% chance of several more months of higher prices before there is a pullback.<h2 id=\"11-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-weak-breakout-above-the-september-high\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has weak breakout above the September high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SP500-Emini-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-breakout-but-measured-move-target-above.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-14-3.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini futures weekly candlestick chart has weak breakout but measured move target above\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart gapped up this week to a new all-time high, but sold off and closed the gap.

They then would want a resumption of the bull trend and a new all-time high.<h3 id=\"12-reversal-down-or-a-pullback-in-bull-trend\">Reversal down or a pullback in bull trend?</h3><p>What is more likely, a reversal down, or a pullback and then a resumption up? This is the most common and most important question that traders face. There are many variables.<p>There was a big gap up and a big reversal down this week. Big Up, Big Down creates Big Confusion. Traders need more information. They will get that over the next couple weeks. If there are 2 or 3 big bear bars closing near their lows, traders will conclude that this week will remain the high for the year.<p>But if there is a good buy signal bar next week or the following week, traders will bet that the rally will make a new high before the end of the year.<p>Therefore, next week will be important. But it will probably disappoint the bulls and bears because the confusion should lead to a pause for at least a week or two. However, the trend is up and this is not a strong sell signal. The odds favor higher prices, even if there is a pause for a few weeks.<h2 id=\"13-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-is-stalling-at-the-september-high\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is stalling at the September high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SP500-Emini-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-weak-breakout-above-September-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-14-4.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini futures daily candlestick chart has weak breakout above September all time high\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke to a new all-time high on Monday, but sold off and closed below the September 2 high, which was the former high. This is disappointing for the bulls. When there is a breakout to a new high, they want the day to close above the old high.<p>On Wednesday, the bulls got a close that was barely above the September 2 all-time high close, but Thursday closed back below that high. This is not what typically happens when a breakout will go far above the old high. It increases the chance that the Emini might have to go sideways more before it can go higher.<p>There is another problem with the 2-week rally. While the rally covered a lot of points, look at the bars. Nine of the past 12 bars closed either in the middle of its range or around its open. Those are not strong bars.<p>Where are several consecutive bull bars closing near their highs? That is what typically happens when a rally is going to continue much higher. Therefore, while the rally has gone up far and fast, and traders expect higher prices, the bars are not strong. This is probably not the start of a strong move up.<p>And the failure to have a close far above the September high is another sign of hesitation on the part of the bulls. This reduces the chance of the rally racing up strongly next week. The Emini probably has to go sideways to down for at least a few more days, before the bulls will consider buying aggressively again.<p>Can Monday’s big selloff remain the high for 2020? The bulls have a 40% chance. But if the Emini begins to reverse down strongly for several days, traders will conclude that there will not be a new high until next year.<h2 id=\"14-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It triggered a weak High 2 bull flag buy signal. However, before the open today, Moderna announced that its vaccine is 94% effective. This resulted in a sharp rally, and the Emini will gap up today.<p>Last Monday, Pfizer made a similar announcement before the open. The Emini gapped up to a new all-time high, but then sold off all day. Will today do the same thing? If it does, today will be a sell signal bar for tomorrow. The bears will have a double top with last week’s high.<p>But today may do the opposite. The Emini could rally strongly to above last week’s high. Day traders should be ready for anything. If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down on the open, there will be an increased chance of a trend from the open.<p>More often when there is a big gap up, the Emini goes sideways for an hour or two until it gets closer to the EMA on the 5-minute chart. That is a trading range open. The bears want a wedge top or a double top. The bulls want a pullback to the EMA that forms a wedge bottom or a double bottom.<p>If there is a trading range open, which is likely, the trend that follows typically does not last all day. There is usually another trading range or a small reversal late in the day.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 31 points in the Globex session. But it was up 50 points an hour ago on the release of the Moderna vaccine news. This reversal down increases the chance of a trading range open, which is already likely because of the likely big gap up.<p>Day traders always have to be open to anything. Even with the overnight gap up and reversal down, today could still be a bull trend day.<p>Since day traders expect a trading range open, they will be quick to take profits on any sharp move up or down on the open. If there are 2 or 3 big trend bars on the open, but then a reversal, that would increase the chance of other reversals over the 1st couple hours, which would create a trading range open. But if a trend on the open continues to 5 or more bars, day traders will begin to consider that the opening trend could be the start of a trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-16.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-minor-lower-high-after-expanding-triangle-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex minor lower high after expanding triangle top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart reversed down last week from an Expanding Triangle top. The bears want today to reverse down from a lower high and continue down to the November 4 low.<p>However, the rally 2 weeks ago was strong. The bulls think that today’s high might not have adequately tested the high of that rally. They therefore should buy around last week’s low. If they do, there will be a small double bottom bull flag. They then would try to get a break above the November 9 high.<p>I continue to make the point that the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 4 months and that traders expect reversals. Everyone know that there will eventually be a breakout. Until there are consecutive closes above or below the range, traders will continue to take quick profits, and sell reversals down and buy reversals up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight broke above Friday’s high and then reversed down. The bears want a break below yesterday’s low so that today will be an outside down day on the daily chart. If today closes near its low, whether or not today is outside down, the odds will favor lower prices tomorrow.<p>The bulls know that and want to prevent that. Therefore, they will look for a buy setup around yesterday’s low. They will then try to get today to close back up in the middle of the day’s range. That would increase the chance that tomorrow will be sideways instead of down.<p>The overnight selloff has not been strong. While it is easier to make money selling in a reversal down, unless the selloff becomes bigger and more persistent, the bulls will expect a trading range to begin to develop. If one begins to form, they will buy reversals up from the low for scalps.<p>Because today is a lower high after an Expanding Triangle top on the daily chart, traders are expecting at least a 1 to 2-day second leg down. Consequently, the EURUSD will probably be sideways to down for at least a day or two. If so, it will be easier for day traders to make money on shorts than longs.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-triangle-trading-range-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle trading range with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls got a late breakout and today closed near the high.<p>After consecutive days closing near their highs, the Emini should trade higher tomorrow.

Therefore, they will look for a buy setup around yesterday’s low. They will then try to get today to close back up in the middle of the day’s range. That would increase the chance that tomorrow will be sideways instead of down.<p>The overnight selloff has not been strong. While it is easier to make money selling in a reversal down, unless the selloff becomes bigger and more persistent, the bulls will expect a trading range to begin to develop. If one begins to form, they will buy reversals up from the low for scalps.<p>Because today is a lower high after an Expanding Triangle top on the daily chart, traders are expecting at least a 1 to 2-day second leg down. Consequently, the EURUSD will probably be sideways to down for at least a day or two. If so, it will be easier for day traders to make money on shorts than longs.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-triangle-trading-range-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle trading range with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini gapped up on the Moderna’s news, but then formed a trading range day. There was a High 2 bottom near the EMA on the open, and then a parabolic wedge top at the high.<p>There were several more reversals, which formed a triangle. The bulls got a late breakout and today closed near the high.<p>After consecutive days closing near their highs, the Emini should trade higher tomorrow. The all-time high is less than 20 points above today’s high and therefore within reach tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This is uncommon in bull trends that go a long way. However, both Friday and yesterday closed on their highs. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices. The Emini will try to make a new all-time high this week.<p>The bears want a double top with last week’s high, but the momentum up has been strong. If there is a reversal down, traders will expect a trading range rather than a bear trend.<p>What about the Moderna’s news on vaccine? Everyone already knows that there will be a reasonably effective vaccine. The news yesterday just made it easier for the market to do what it wanted to do, which was to test last week’s high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 26 points in the Globex session. It will open around yesterday’s low. The bears would like it to gap down below yesterday’s low. That would create an island top and a lower high double top with last week’s high.<p>Remember, last week sold off strongly from around this level. The bears would then hope for a reversal down to below last week’s low and the October 12 high, which was the breakout point on the daily chart. The bears want a close back below that high. That would increase the chance that the 2-day breakout has failed.<p>However, if today gaps down, the gap will be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour and are trivial. The bulls will look to buy a test of last Wednesday’s high, which was the neckline of last week’s micro double bottom. They are hoping for a reversal up from below yesterday’s low to above yesterday’s high. Today would then be an outside up day on the daily chart, which would make higher prices likely tomorrow.<p>The Emini has been mostly sideways for 6 days. That increases the chance of more sideways trading today, both on the daily chart and on the 5-minute chart. But if the gap stays open and today sells off, traders will look for a test down to last week’s low by the end of the week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-triangle-trading-range-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-17.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle trading range with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls want a successful breakout above the September 1 high at the top of the 4-month trading range.<p>Everyone can see that there have been many strong legs up and down for 4 months. Several broke above or below the range, but each reversed. That is what typically happens when the market is in a trading range, and that is what traders will continue to expect until there are consecutive closes above or below the range. That breakout will eventually happen. And at that point, traders will look for a 400-pip measured move up or down.<p>There are now 4 consecutive bull bars with closes near the high of each bar. That typically leads to at least slightly higher prices. But, despite the strong 3-week rally, a reversal down from around the top of the range is more likely than a successful breakout above the range.<p>Traders are buying because there is no reversal yet and there is room to the top of the range. But will they keep buying if the EURUSD reaches the September 1 high? We will find out.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied from around yesterday’s close to above yesterday’s high. So far, today is a 4th consecutive bull trend day on the daily chart.<p>However, the overnight rally was small and brief. The EURUSD has been sideways for the past several hours. Traders are deciding if the EURUSD will successfully break above the September 16 lower high this week, or again reverse down, like it did last week.<p>With today’s small range, traders suspect that a breakout above, or a reversal down might have to wait for tomorrow. Also, with a 20-pip range over the past 4 hours, it is even difficult for scalpers to make any money. But with room to last week’s high and no 20-pip pullback in 6 hours, day traders are mostly buying, hoping for the rally to reach last week’s high.<p>The EURUSD is near a price where it has reversed down many times over the past 4 months. That increases the chance of either a breakout or a reversal this week. But there is room to last week’s high and the bears have not even been able to make a scalp overnight. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/market-update/emini-all-time-high-modernas-news/attachment/emini-trading-range-day-after-measured-move-up-from-sell-climax/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-17-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It rallied for a couple hours and then went sideways for several hours. Since it stalled around an measured move up from the low to the open, the open was important. That led to a test of the open late in the day. Today closed near the open, like most days for the past 3 weeks.<p>On the daily chart, today was a pullback from a 2-day rally. Today is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. If tomorrow goes above today’s high, it would trigger a buy signal. But with today not closing near its high, it is a weak buy signal bar.<p>The 2-week rally has been strong. The bulls want a breakout far above last week’s all-time high. If tomorrow continues up, the bulls will look for a close above last week’s all-time high at some point this week.<p>However, if the Emini tomorrow trades above today’s high but then reverses down within a couple days, there would be a micro wedge top. Furthermore, the wedge would be the 2nd leg up in a double top with last week’s high. That would increase the chance of at least a couple small legs down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That breakout will eventually happen. And at that point, traders will look for a 400-pip measured move up or down.<p>There are now 4 consecutive bull bars with closes near the high of each bar. That typically leads to at least slightly higher prices. But, despite the strong 3-week rally, a reversal down from around the top of the range is more likely than a successful breakout above the range.<p>Traders are buying because there is no reversal yet and there is room to the top of the range. But will they keep buying if the EURUSD reaches the September 1 high? We will find out.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied from around yesterday’s close to above yesterday’s high. So far, today is a 4th consecutive bull trend day on the daily chart.<p>However, the overnight rally was small and brief. The EURUSD has been sideways for the past several hours. Traders are deciding if the EURUSD will successfully break above the September 16 lower high this week, or again reverse down, like it did last week.<p>With today’s small range, traders suspect that a breakout above, or a reversal down might have to wait for tomorrow. Also, with a 20-pip range over the past 4 hours, it is even difficult for scalpers to make any money. But with room to last week’s high and no 20-pip pullback in 6 hours, day traders are mostly buying, hoping for the rally to reach last week’s high.<p>The EURUSD is near a price where it has reversed down many times over the past 4 months. That increases the chance of either a breakout or a reversal this week. But there is room to last week’s high and the bears have not even been able to make a scalp overnight. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/market-update/emini-all-time-high-modernas-news/attachment/emini-trading-range-day-after-measured-move-up-from-sell-climax/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-17-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It rallied for a couple hours and then went sideways for several hours. Since it stalled around an measured move up from the low to the open, the open was important. That led to a test of the open late in the day. Today closed near the open, like most days for the past 3 weeks.<p>On the daily chart, today was a pullback from a 2-day rally. Today is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. If tomorrow goes above today’s high, it would trigger a buy signal. But with today not closing near its high, it is a weak buy signal bar.<p>The 2-week rally has been strong. The bulls want a breakout far above last week’s all-time high. If tomorrow continues up, the bulls will look for a close above last week’s all-time high at some point this week.<p>However, if the Emini tomorrow trades above today’s high but then reverses down within a couple days, there would be a micro wedge top. Furthermore, the wedge would be the 2nd leg up in a double top with last week’s high. That would increase the chance of at least a couple small legs down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is therefore a buy signal bar for today. However, the bull body was small on the daily chart, and that is a weak buy signal bar. But if today becomes a strong bull day, traders will expect a break above last week’s all-time high within a few days.<p>It is important to note that a rally today would form the 3rd leg up from last week’s low. If the Emini went up today but reversed down within a couple days, there would be a micro wedge top on the daily chart. In addition, the rally would be the 2nd leg up in a double top with last week’s high. That would make traders look for at least a couple small legs down next week.<p>So far, this week is a small doji inside bar on the weekly chart. That increases the chance of more sideways trading for the rest of the week. But one big bull or bear day can dramatically change the appearance of this week’s candlestick.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. Since yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar and today should open relatively near yesterday’s high, day traders expect today to trade above yesterday’s high. That would trigger the daily buy signal.<p>Because the setup is not strong, traders are not expecting a big bull trend. But if a breakout above yesterday’s high comes from a series of strong bull trend bars on the 5-minute chart, there would be an increased chance of a big bull trend day today.<p>Can today be a big bear day, whether or not it triggers the buy signal? Yes, but after 3 bull days and with last week’s high being a magnet just above, the odds favor sideways to up.<p>I have made the point many times over the past few weeks, that most days have closed near the middle or open of the day. Since markets have inertia, day traders should expect that again today. But if there is a strong trend in either direction, day traders will bet on the trend continuing all day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-trading-range-day-after-measured-move-up-from-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-18.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day after measured move up from sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The chart is back to neutral after being bullish for a couple weeks. Traders are now deciding it the bulls will get a successful breakout above the September 10 high, or if the double top will lead to a reversal down. The shrinking bodies over the past 4 days is a sign of a loss of momentum as the rally tests the September 10 high a 2nd time. That increases the chance of at least a small test down over the next couple days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly early overnight but then reversed back down to open of the session. The reversal down has been strong enough so that traders do not expect a rally back up to the high of the day.<p>The bears want the day to close either around the open or the low of the day. With the strong reversal down on the 5-minute chart and the shrinking bodies on the daily chart, today will probably not be a bull trend day. That means it is likely to be either a bear trend day or a trading range day.<p>While the selloff of the past 5 hours has been good for the bears, the EURUSD fell only 40 pips. That is not a strong bear trend. Consequently, traders are not looking for a big bear day at the moment. That leaves a trading range day as the most likely outcome.<p>So far, today’s high is below yesterday’s high, today’s low is above yesterday’s low, and the EURUSD is trading around the open of the day. This behavior is consistent with a trading range day. However, the bounces over the past 5 hours have all been less than 15 pips. Therefore, day traders are currently only looking to sell. The bear swing has not yet ended.<p>But if the 5-minute chart starts to go sideways for an hour or has a 20-pip bounce, day traders will also look to buy again. This is likely since yesterday was a small, sideways day, and today so far is even a smaller day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-early-trading-range-and-late-baer-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini early trading range and late baer trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That is a Bear Trending Trading Range day.

Today is a good candidate for the start of that 2nd leg down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That increases the chance of at least a small test down over the next couple days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly early overnight but then reversed back down to open of the session. The reversal down has been strong enough so that traders do not expect a rally back up to the high of the day.<p>The bears want the day to close either around the open or the low of the day. With the strong reversal down on the 5-minute chart and the shrinking bodies on the daily chart, today will probably not be a bull trend day. That means it is likely to be either a bear trend day or a trading range day.<p>While the selloff of the past 5 hours has been good for the bears, the EURUSD fell only 40 pips. That is not a strong bear trend. Consequently, traders are not looking for a big bear day at the moment. That leaves a trading range day as the most likely outcome.<p>So far, today’s high is below yesterday’s high, today’s low is above yesterday’s low, and the EURUSD is trading around the open of the day. This behavior is consistent with a trading range day. However, the bounces over the past 5 hours have all been less than 15 pips. Therefore, day traders are currently only looking to sell. The bear swing has not yet ended.<p>But if the 5-minute chart starts to go sideways for an hour or has a 20-pip bounce, day traders will also look to buy again. This is likely since yesterday was a small, sideways day, and today so far is even a smaller day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-early-trading-range-and-late-baer-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini early trading range and late baer trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There was then a bear breakout and it continued down for the rest of the day to below the September high.<p>Most of the time when there is a breakout below a trading range, it is brief and it leads to a lower trading range. That is a Bear Trending Trading Range day. That happened to day for about an hour and a half, but then the Emini collapsed into the close.<p>In the chatroom, I have been saying that the 5 day rally was likely to be a bull leg in a trading range instead of a resumption of the bull trend, and that the big bear day from last week was likely to have a 2nd leg down. Today is a good candidate for the start of that 2nd leg down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bears expected at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down after last week’s big bear day. Yesterday might be the start of that 2nd leg down.<p>The bulls hope that yesterday was just a pullback in the 5-day rally. But the range was big, it formed an Emini double top with last week’s high, and it closed back below the September high. These factors increase the chance of some follow-through selling today, or at least sideways trading.<p>I have mentioned several times that the Emini has not been behaving well around the September high. Several days that traded above it closed below it. That is not typically how successful breakouts behave. The bulls might need a double bottom with last week’s low before they can try again to break strongly above the September high.<h3>Emini Monthly chart has a problem</h3><p>Can the Emini go far above the September high? If you have been reading my weekend blogs, you would know that I think the monthly chart is a problem for the bulls. Last month was a High 1 buy signal bar, but it had a bear body. In addition, it was a 2nd consecutive bear bar on the monthly chart. I said that the rally might last a month or two, but traders should expect sideways to down trading for many months, possibly for the entire 1st half of next year.<p>Also, the yearly chart is a problem as well. I will show it again at the end of the year. This year is a big outside bar on the yearly chart and it is coming late in a bull trend. That is a sign of exhaustion and balance, and it reduces the chance of much higher prices next year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 9 points in the Globex session. Since yesterday was a strong bear trend day, there should be exhausted bears today. There is a 50% chance of strong follow-through selling on the open, but a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour. Traders know that there is only a 25% chance of another strong bear trend day today.<p>Today might gap down, but if it does, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour and are not important.<p>Remember, traders will look for an early trading range today. If they get it, the bears will want trend resumption down later in the day to around 3500, and last week’s low. The bulls will want trend reversal to 3600, which is the top of the sell climax at the end of yesterday and at the EMA on the 60-minute chart.<p>Also, at a minimum, the bulls want to get back above the September high of 3576.75, which has been an important magnet. If today does not collapse on the open, the Emini should test that level at some point today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-early-trading-range-and-late-baer-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-19.png\" alt=\"Emini early trading range and late baer trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls see these 2 weeks as a bull flag and want a breakout above the September 1 high. The bears want a reversal down from a double top with the September 10 high or the September 1 top of the 4-month range.<p>Everyone knows that there will be a breakout above or below the 4-month range at some point, but look at the chart. There have been many strong legs up and down, and each has reversed. Traders look to sell reversals down from the top and buy reversals up from the low.<p>We do not know if the November 19 high is high enough up for the bears to sell aggressively. The past 2 sideways weeks mean that traders are deciding if the November 9 high will be the start of a swing down or if the EURUSD will go up to the top of the 4-month range.<p>Since yesterday was a small sell signal bar and it followed 4 bull days, this is not a strong top. That means it is still slightly more likely that the EURUSD will go sideways more, or test up to the September 1 high. But a couple big bear days will flip the odds in favor of a breakout below the November 11 low and a test of the bottom of the range.<p>The bars have been small and the tails have been prominent for several days. That means traders think the price is just about right, and it increases the chance of another small day today.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market broke below yesterday’s low overnight. This triggered a minor sell signal on the daily chart.<p>While the EURUSD has traded down on the 5-minute chart overnight, it has been mostly sideways. There was a trading range, a brief bear breakout, and then a lower range. This is a Bear Trending Trading Range Day, which is a weak type of bear trend.<p>The emphasis is on the words “Trading Range.” Day traders are looking for reversals and small profits. While it is possible for any day to suddenly become a strong trend day, traders are currently betting against it and taking scalps up and down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-after-trend-reversal-up-from-gap-down-and-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption after trend reversal up from gap down and sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

My minimum expectation was at least 2 hours, and this one lasted 3 hours. The bulls got late trend resumption up to the September high.<p>Because today reversed up from a test of the October 12 breakout point and today had a bull body, it is a buy signal bar for tomorrow. Tomorrow will probably trade above today’s high and trigger the buy signal. The target above is the start of yesterday’s sell climax, which is around 3600.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want the week to close above the September high and the open of the week. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>The bears want the week to close on the low of the week and below the October 12 high, which was the breakout point for the rally 2 weeks ago. However, with today’s reversal up from that support, tomorrow will probably not reverse back strongly down. Traders expect sideways to up tomorrow.<p>If the week remains an inside bar tomorrow, this week will be both a buy and sell signal bar for next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There is a 50% chance of strong follow-through selling on the open, but a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour. Traders know that there is only a 25% chance of another strong bear trend day today.<p>Today might gap down, but if it does, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour and are not important.<p>Remember, traders will look for an early trading range today. If they get it, the bears will want trend resumption down later in the day to around 3500, and last week’s low. The bulls will want trend reversal to 3600, which is the top of the sell climax at the end of yesterday and at the EMA on the 60-minute chart.<p>Also, at a minimum, the bulls want to get back above the September high of 3576.75, which has been an important magnet. If today does not collapse on the open, the Emini should test that level at some point today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-early-trading-range-and-late-baer-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-19.png\" alt=\"Emini early trading range and late baer trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls see these 2 weeks as a bull flag and want a breakout above the September 1 high. The bears want a reversal down from a double top with the September 10 high or the September 1 top of the 4-month range.<p>Everyone knows that there will be a breakout above or below the 4-month range at some point, but look at the chart. There have been many strong legs up and down, and each has reversed. Traders look to sell reversals down from the top and buy reversals up from the low.<p>We do not know if the November 19 high is high enough up for the bears to sell aggressively. The past 2 sideways weeks mean that traders are deciding if the November 9 high will be the start of a swing down or if the EURUSD will go up to the top of the 4-month range.<p>Since yesterday was a small sell signal bar and it followed 4 bull days, this is not a strong top. That means it is still slightly more likely that the EURUSD will go sideways more, or test up to the September 1 high. But a couple big bear days will flip the odds in favor of a breakout below the November 11 low and a test of the bottom of the range.<p>The bars have been small and the tails have been prominent for several days. That means traders think the price is just about right, and it increases the chance of another small day today.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market broke below yesterday’s low overnight. This triggered a minor sell signal on the daily chart.<p>While the EURUSD has traded down on the 5-minute chart overnight, it has been mostly sideways. There was a trading range, a brief bear breakout, and then a lower range. This is a Bear Trending Trading Range Day, which is a weak type of bear trend.<p>The emphasis is on the words “Trading Range.” Day traders are looking for reversals and small profits. While it is possible for any day to suddenly become a strong trend day, traders are currently betting against it and taking scalps up and down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-after-trend-reversal-up-from-gap-down-and-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption after trend reversal up from gap down and sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

My minimum expectation was at least 2 hours, and this one lasted 3 hours. The bulls got late trend resumption up to the September high.<p>Because today reversed up from a test of the October 12 breakout point and today had a bull body, it is a buy signal bar for tomorrow. Tomorrow will probably trade above today’s high and trigger the buy signal. The target above is the start of yesterday’s sell climax, which is around 3600.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want the week to close above the September high and the open of the week. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>The bears want the week to close on the low of the week and below the October 12 high, which was the breakout point for the rally 2 weeks ago. However, with today’s reversal up from that support, tomorrow will probably not reverse back strongly down. Traders expect sideways to up tomorrow.<p>If the week remains an inside bar tomorrow, this week will be both a buy and sell signal bar for next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is the breakout point for the rally 2 weeks ago. Yesterday is now a Breakout Test and a buy signal bar for today. The reversal up was strong enough so that today should trade above yesterday’s high, which would trigger the buy signal.<p>The bulls want today to close above the September high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>However, the week so far is a small, inside bar on the weekly chart. That could limit the size of any trend up or down today.<p>The bears want this week to close below the October 12 high. But with the Emini reversing up yesterday from that support, the odds are against a big bear day today.<p>Most likely, today will trade above yesterday’s high and be sideways to up. The obvious magnet is the September high. If the Emini is within 20 points of it in the final hour, it will probably get drawn to it. Traders would then decide if the week should close above or below it.<h3>Weekly support and resistance can be important on Fridays</h3><p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The week will probably remain an inside week.<p>The nearest magnets today are the midpoint of the week, the September high, and the current high and low of the week. With the midpoint of the week at the September high and yesterday’s close, and the EMA on the 60-minute chart, that is the strongest magnet. If the Emini is within 20 points of that area in the final hour, it will probably get drawn there.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini in the Globex session is trading around the close of yesterday’s day session. It will probably trade above yesterday’s high today, which would trigger a buy signal on the daily chart.<p>But it has been oscillating around the September high for 2 weeks and it is now at that high, and in the middle of the 2-week range. That increases the chance that today will try to end the week around the September high. It therefore reduces the chance of a strong trend day. If there is a trend up or down in the first half of the day, there is an increased chance of a reversal back to the September high in the middle of the day.<p>Yesterday reversed much of Wednesday’s selloff. That sell climax began at 3600. The top of a sell climax is a magnet when there is a reversal up. Therefore, there is an increased chance that the Emini will reach 3600 today.<p>Will it continue up to Wednesday’s high? It probably will not, given all of the magnets around the September high and how much trading range trading there has been this week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-after-trend-reversal-up-from-gap-down-and-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-20.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption after trend reversal up from gap down and sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is after an expanding triangle. A triangle after an expanding triangle is a Diamond pattern. Since the chart has been in a trading range for 4 months, it is already in Breakout Mode. A Diamond pattern therefore does not change anything. Until there are consecutive closes above or below the 4-month range, traders will continue to take quick profits and look for reversals.<p>Today is Friday and this week will probably remain a doji candlestick and an inside bar on the weekly chart. A doji is neutral and an inside bar is another Breakout Mode pattern.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the open so that the week will have a bull body. That would slightly increase the chance of higher prices next week. The bears want a bear body, which would slightly increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a trading range overnight. Furthermore, it has been in a trading range for 4 days. It is at the apex of a triangle on the daily chart. All of these factors increase the chance that today will remain a trading range day. Day traders are looking for reversals and scalping for 10 pips.<p>Any day can become a trend day, but given what is happening, the odds are that today will remain a trading range day. But if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, day traders will switch to swing trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with late bear breakout\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls made another attempt to get back to the September high and failed. The Emini then closed on its low.<p>Today is a bear inside bar on the daily chart. It is therefore a sell signal bar. This week is a bear inside bar on the weekly chart, and it is a weekly sell signal bar as well.<p>With the week closing on the low, next week might gap down. That would trigger the daily and weekly sell signals.

Traders would then decide if the week should close above or below it.<h3>Weekly support and resistance can be important on Fridays</h3><p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The week will probably remain an inside week.<p>The nearest magnets today are the midpoint of the week, the September high, and the current high and low of the week. With the midpoint of the week at the September high and yesterday’s close, and the EMA on the 60-minute chart, that is the strongest magnet. If the Emini is within 20 points of that area in the final hour, it will probably get drawn there.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini in the Globex session is trading around the close of yesterday’s day session. It will probably trade above yesterday’s high today, which would trigger a buy signal on the daily chart.<p>But it has been oscillating around the September high for 2 weeks and it is now at that high, and in the middle of the 2-week range. That increases the chance that today will try to end the week around the September high. It therefore reduces the chance of a strong trend day. If there is a trend up or down in the first half of the day, there is an increased chance of a reversal back to the September high in the middle of the day.<p>Yesterday reversed much of Wednesday’s selloff. That sell climax began at 3600. The top of a sell climax is a magnet when there is a reversal up. Therefore, there is an increased chance that the Emini will reach 3600 today.<p>Will it continue up to Wednesday’s high? It probably will not, given all of the magnets around the September high and how much trading range trading there has been this week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-after-trend-reversal-up-from-gap-down-and-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-20.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption after trend reversal up from gap down and sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is after an expanding triangle. A triangle after an expanding triangle is a Diamond pattern. Since the chart has been in a trading range for 4 months, it is already in Breakout Mode. A Diamond pattern therefore does not change anything. Until there are consecutive closes above or below the 4-month range, traders will continue to take quick profits and look for reversals.<p>Today is Friday and this week will probably remain a doji candlestick and an inside bar on the weekly chart. A doji is neutral and an inside bar is another Breakout Mode pattern.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the open so that the week will have a bull body. That would slightly increase the chance of higher prices next week. The bears want a bear body, which would slightly increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a trading range overnight. Furthermore, it has been in a trading range for 4 days. It is at the apex of a triangle on the daily chart. All of these factors increase the chance that today will remain a trading range day. Day traders are looking for reversals and scalping for 10 pips.<p>Any day can become a trend day, but given what is happening, the odds are that today will remain a trading range day. But if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, day traders will switch to swing trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with late bear breakout\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

They gave up in the final hour and the bears got trend resumption down.<p>However, the selloff began at noon, which is usually too early to last until the close when the day is a trading range day, like today. The bulls made another attempt to get back to the September high and failed. The Emini then closed on its low.<p>Today is a bear inside bar on the daily chart. It is therefore a sell signal bar. This week is a bear inside bar on the weekly chart, and it is a weekly sell signal bar as well.<p>With the week closing on the low, next week might gap down. That would trigger the daily and weekly sell signals. If there is early, strong selling on Monday, it could lead to several days down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Emini</strong>futures market is stalling at the September high. There are bear inside bar sell signals on the daily and weekly charts.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are trying to reverse up from a double bottom on the weekly chart. But because the bear channel has been tight, a trading range is more likely than a bull trend.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex weekly chart formed a bull inside bar this week. This is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar, but it is at the top of a 9-week tight trading range. Traders are deciding if the summer rally is resuming or if there will be a 2nd leg down from the 4-month wedge top.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30-year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-weekly-chart-reversing-up-from-bottom-of-8-month-trading-range\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart reversing up from bottom of 8-month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-reversing-up-from-parabolic-wedge-and-double-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-21.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart reversing up from parabolic wedge and double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures market reversed up last week from a lower low double bottom with the June 5 low, which is the bottom of the 8-month trading range. But because last week’s reversal bar had a bear body, it is not a strong buy signal bar. However, this week had a bull body and it closed near the high of the week.<p>There is now a 2-bar reversal with the 2nd week being a bull bar closing near its high. This is a higher probability buy setup. Traders expect the bond futures next week to go above this week’s high. That would trigger the buy signal.<p>Since it is taking place at the bottom of a trading range, the bond futures should rally for at least a week. Can the rally reach the top of the 8-month range? Probably not without one or more pullbacks along the way.<p>This week is also a Low 1 sell signal bar for the 4-month bear trend that began on August 6. But it is a bull bar and it is at the bottom of a trading range. That make this a low probability sell signal. There probably are more buyers than sellers below this week’s low.<h3 id=\"3-spike-and-channel-bear-trend\">Spike and Channel Bear Trend</h3><p>The selloff from the August high was a bear Spike and Channel pattern. The top of the 1st pullback after the August 13 spike down was the start of the channel. That is the September 3 or September 29 high, above 177. When a spike and channel pattern reverses up, the rally typically reaches around the start of the channel. The chart then usually evolves into a trading range.<p>At the moment, I think the bond futures might not get that high. A more important target is the November 5 high. That was the start of a sharp reversal down from a huge bull day on November 4.<h3 id=\"4-pullback-to-below-bottom-of-bull-trend\">Pullback to below bottom of bull trend</h3><p>While last week’s low fell below the low of that big bull bar, the selloff still can be viewed as a deep pullback from that big bull bar. Sometimes a pullback early in a bull trend will drop below the start of the bull trend, and then the market reverses up again.<p>If there is a 2nd reversal, like on November 11, technicians will say that the 1st reversal up failed and this is now a 2nd reversal up. While I think this is correct in a strict sense, it is not that simple. The forces at play are consistent with the new low being simply a deep pullback from the strong reversal up on November 4. It was so deep that it actually pulled back below the bottom of the big bull bar.<p>So, who is right, me or the rest of the world? I would not be bringing this up if I did not think I was right. The more open a trader is to different ideas, the more trades he will find and the more confident he will be when he manages his trades. Therefore, it is reasonable to view the November 11 new low as simply a pullback that was surprisingly big, so big that it dipped below the bottom of the bull trend.<h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"6-eurusd-weekly-chart-formed-an-bull-inside-bar-and-high-1-buy-signal-bar-but-at-top-of-9-week-tight-trading-range\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart formed an bull inside bar and High 1 buy signal bar, but at top of 9-week tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-with-inside-bar-and-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-but-in-tight-trading-range-after-wedge-buy-climax-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-21-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart with inside bar and High 1 bull flag buy signal but in tight trading range after wedge buy climax top.png\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart formed a small sideways week this week. Its low was above last week’s low and its high was below last week’s high. This week was therefore an inside bar, which is a sign of neutrality.<p>It is a type of Breakout Mode pattern. The bulls see it as a buy signal bar for a pullback from the strong rally 2 weeks ago. For the bears, it is a sell signal bar. They see the 2-week rally as a pullback from the September 25 1st leg down. The bears want a 2nd leg down from the 4-month wedge top.<p>Who is right? Both are! Which is more likely, a continuation up from the 2-week rally or a reversal down? A Breakout Mode pattern is usually very close to a 50-50 pattern. The bull body and the big bull bar 2 weeks ago, make a bull breakout slightly more likely. But whether there is a bull or bear breakout, next week will probably not be a big trend bar.<p>Also, with the weekly chart being in a tight trading range for 9 weeks, traders expect more reversals. Consequently, this Breakout Mode pattern will probably not immediately lead to a trend. There probably will be sellers not far above and buyers not far below. This should lead to at least another week or two of quiet trading, as traders continue to decide on the direction of the next move.<h3 id=\"7-all-breakout-mode-patterns-eventually-break-out\">All Breakout Mode patterns eventually break out</h3><p>There will eventually be a trend again. But betting that any one week will be the start is a low probability bet. If the bulls get a couple consecutive big bull bars, traders will conclude that the correction from the 4-month wedge buy climax has ended. They will look for a new high and a rally up to the February 2018 high at around 1.25.<p>If the bears instead get consecutive big bear bars, they will look for a deeper correction from the 4-month wedge top. Their 1st target is the March 9 high, which was the breakout point of the summer rally.<h2 id=\"8-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"9-a-stock-market-fairy-tale-about-a-lame-but-very-strong-duck\">A stock market fairy tale about a lame, but very strong duck</h2><p>This is complicated, but it makes sense. At the very least, I find it interesting, and some of you might as well. Also, it is important, even if it has a 10% chance of becoming reality.<p>I don’t like to write about politics because it invariably will be emotional for some readers, and that is a distraction. We need to focus on what the markets are doing.<p>Sometimes, however, the political situation can have a significant impact on the markets, and when it might, it is worth discussing. In this case, the politics could result in a fast 20% selloff in January, and it is therefore worth mentioning.<p>President Trump is the most powerful man on earth… until January 20. He is a man who enjoys using his power. Do you think he will only use it to pardon himself and his friends, and fire some people he does not like? Or, do you think he will look for other ways to use his remaining brief, extreme power?<p>I suspect he will use as much of it as he can, and there are many possible things he can do. Some are unimaginable. He is a lame, but very strong duck. He has spent 4 years doing whatever he could to improve the chance of getting re-elected and to punish his enemies. It is worth considering what he might do to continue this behavior right up until January 20.<h3 id=\"10-follow-the-money-or-see-who-benefits\">Follow the money, or see who benefits</h3><p>Who are enemies that can only be damaged by a president? Well, other countries and the incoming president are good candidates. Which country is the one that his base loves to hate the most? Iran!!<p>I believe he would like to hammer them, and as would many Americans, especially his base. He might see this as improving his chances of getting elected again in 4 years. Also, it would create a huge problem for Biden, who wants to make nice with the Ayatollah, and for Macron and Merkel, whom Trump can’t stand. President Trump would love to leave a mess for them as he exits.<p>Would Trump bomb Iran? Nope. He recently discussed this with the Pentagon, and they dissuaded him. Also, he said no more wars in the Middle East.<p>Well, Iran has threatened to wipe Israel off the map many times. And Israel said that it will stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Also, Israel knows that no president will ever be as supportive of it as President Trump. He is the best for them by a long shot. If they are going to do something, this is their best opportunity ever, and it is unlikely that they will ever have this kind of support from an American president again.<p>If Israel were to attack Iran, they would need US political and intelligence support. What if Trump fired the Pentagon brass earlier this month to put in people who would support a plan for Israel to attack Iran?<p>The pieces fit together. Follow the money, or at least think about whether enough people in power benefit sufficiently to try to make this happen. Israel just made friends with the UAE, which hates Iran. Saudi Arabia has to still be mad about Iran blowing up its oil fields. Both would love Israel to greatly damage Iran, and Israel and the U.S. would love to have the blessing of a couple Muslim nations to offset the certain worldwide condemnation.<h3 id=\"11-if-long-be-careful-starting-on-january-6\">If long, be careful starting on January 6</h3><p>Is all of this a coincidence or a plan? I bet there are political forces at play that are trying to line things up to offer Israel the best opportunity it ever will have to attack Iran.<p>Will they seize the moment and attack? It is a huge decision, and I think they will not. But this is their best chance, and they know it.<p>The reason they will probably not attack is a fear of reprisals. Iran will send rockets into cities in Israel, and there would be an unbearable number of civilian casualties. The back and forth over the course of a month or two would be horrific.<p>If Israel were to attack, it would have to do it as soon as possible to get as much help as possible from President Trump. They would need clearance from President Trump, but he does not want to lose the 2 Georgia Senate seats on January 5. So that is why January 6 or shortly thereafter makes sense, if this is going to happen.<p>In fact, if President Trump is thinking about doing<em>anything</em>big and disruptive, he will probably wait until after January 5. And I think there is a good chance that he will do something big. If he does anything that affects the stock market, it would probably result in a selloff and not a rally.<h3 id=\"12-if-israel-bombs-iran-the-stock-market-will-fall\">If Israel bombs Iran, the stock market will fall</h3><p>An attack on Iran would cause a quick 20% selloff in the stock market. Anyone long should consider buying puts on January 5, or at least be aware of an increased chance of a selloff.<p>What about the aftermath? If Israel were to attack, President Trump would deny any knowledge of the attack and condemn it in the mildest terms, while having the U.S. military intelligence secretly support it.<p>Absurdity can be reality in the right circumstances. Here is some more. An attack would provide the President with another laughable reason to stay in office after January 20. Even Mayor Bloomberg used a crisis to bypass term limits in NYC. President Trump would claim that the world’s new crisis needs stability, and his remaining in office would provide that stability. Obviously, he could not stay in office, but his base would love him to make that bold claim.<h3 id=\"13-good-chance-of-a-final-surprise\">Good chance of a final surprise</h3><p>We have had a very surprising 4 years. Traders should be wary of a final surprise. A surprise means something unthinkable or very unlikely… a low probability event.<p>I know many of you think this is conspiracy nonsense with no chance of it happening. I agree that it is conspiracy nonsense, but we have an unpredictable president, and Israel has an unusually good opportunity to do something they have been talking about doing for years. Also, many countries might see this as a rare opportunity to do something to ensure their survival. Therefore, it, or some other big surprise, has a 10% chance of happening.<p>I want to emphasize that Israel attacking Iran is a low probability bet. But I think there is at least a 30% chance of some big surprise after January 5. If there is one, it could put a lid on the stock market for many months. This is consistent with the monthly chart, which appears to have limited upside for many months after December (see below). That makes it worth mentioning, especially since I haven’t heard it elsewhere.<h2 id=\"14-monthly-emini-chart-has-big-bull-bar-in-november-but-rally-is-stalling-at-september-high\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has big bull bar in November, but rally is stalling at September high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Eminii-futures-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-weak-ioi-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-21-2.png\" alt=\"Eminii futures S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart breaking above weak ioi bull flag buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a bull trend for a decade and a trading range for 3 years. The summer rally broke above the top of the trading range and the bulls are hoping that it will continue up for an 1100-point measured move up. While that will happen someday, it probably will not happen for many years.<p>Near-term, the Emini in November broke above the October high, which triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal. While the Emini rallied to a new all-time high, it is now back at the breakout point of last month’s high.<p>I wrote last month that this was a weak buy setup. This is because October was a bear bar, and it was a 2nd consecutive bear bar. Also, the summer rally was climactic. Additionally, the break above the February high did not go very far before stalling. These factors all tend to limit the extend of the rally above last month’s high.<h3 id=\"15-at-top-of-likely-10-year-trading-range\">At top of likely 10-year trading range</h3><p>I said that the rally might last a month or two, but probably not much more. What typically happens with a weak bull flag in a buy climax at resistance, is that the Emini soon goes sideways to down for many bars. How many? Maybe 5 to 10. That means that while the rally might continue into December, traders should expect that the Emini will be sideways to down for the 1st half of next year.<p>At that point, traders will decide on the direction of the next move. When the rally into 2017 became the most extreme buy climax in history, I said that the Emini would probably be mostly sideways for a decade.<p>It has been sideways for 3 years. While it is now at the top of the range, the odds still favor a trading range for many more years.<p>When there is a range, the Emini will test the top and bottom. We are now testing the top. At some point in the next few years, it is more likely than not that the Emini will test the bottom, which is this year’s low below 2200.<h3 id=\"16-getting-near-the-end-of-the-year\">Getting near the end of the year</h3><p>I want to make one final point. I have occasionally posted a yearly chart, and I will again at the end of the year.<p>This year is a big outside year (it traded below the 2019 low and above the 2019 high). Also, this is coming 10 years into a bull trend. Therefore, there is an increased chance that this year will be an exhaustive end of that trend. If it is, 2020 will probably not close on its high and not close above 2019.<p>Furthermore, there is an increased chance of it forming a doji bar. That means a close near the open of the year. The year opened around 3200. That is 12% below the November all-time high. While no one is talking about a selloff into the end of the year, it is a real possibility when a big outside bar comes late in a bull trend.<h2 id=\"17-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-bear-inside-bar-after-last-weeks-breakout-above-a-3-month-trading-range\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has bear inside bar after last week’s breakout above a 3-month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-futures-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-bear-inside-bar-for-failed-breakout-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-21-3.png\" alt=\"Emini futures S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart has bear inside bar for failed breakout\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a bear body this week. The low of the week was above last week’s low and the high was below last week’s high. This week is therefore an inside bar. That is a Breakout Mode pattern, which is often neutral. But with this week closing on its low and it being a 2nd consecutive bear bar, next week will probably trade below this week’s low.<p>The bulls see this week as a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. It is a pullback from last week’s breakout to a new all-time high. However, consecutive bear bars make this a weak buy setup. There probably will be more sellers than buyers above last week’s high.<p>This week is also a sell signal. The bears see it as a sign that last week’s breakout is failing. They want a reversal back down to the bottom of the 3-month trading range. Ultimately, they want the reversal to continue down to the middle of the 3-year trading range.<p>With this week closing near its low after last week’s break above the 3-month range, there is an increased chance of a reversal down and possibly a gap down next week. If there is a big selloff next week, with or without a big gap down, traders will expect lower prices for at least another week after that.<h2 id=\"18-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-stalling-at-september-high\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart stalling at September high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-futures-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-small-double-top-at-September-high-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-21-4.png\" alt=\"Emini futures S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart small double top at September high\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been sideways for 2 weeks. It has been oscillating around the September high and bouncing off the October 12 high. That was the breakout point of the rally 2 weeks ago. It is the neckline of the September/October double bottom.<p>The bulls see the 2-week trading range as a bull flag. They expect a strong break above the November 9 all-time high and then a 150-point measured move up, based on the height of the trading range. They will probably need a bull bar early next week before the rally can resume up.<p>However, the bears see a small double top. They want a breakout below the November 10 low, which is the neck line of that double top. It is also below the October 12 high, which is the breakout point of the September/October double bottom.<p>With Friday’s close back at the October 12 high after 2 tests of that breakout point last week, there is an increased chance of a break back below that breakout point. That would likely lead to a deeper pullback, like to the middle or bottom of the November rally.<p>It is important to note that the Emini has been in a trading range for 4 months. It is now at the top of the range. As strong as the rally was 2 weeks ago, there were no consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. That is a weak rally. Furthermore, the Emini has had a hard time getting bars to close above the September high. This is a problem. It increases the chance of a reversal down.<h3 id=\"19-what-will-happen-next-week\">What will happen next week?</h3><p>What is more likely, a successful break above or below the 2-week trading range? They are about equally likely. But if there is a break above, it probably will reverse down before reaching the measured move target around 3800.<p>If there is a break down with consecutive closes below the November 10 low, the Emini should fall at least to the middle of its 3-month trading range and possible to the bottom.<p>Sounds unclear? It should, because confusion is a hallmark of a trading range, and the Emini has been in a small trading range for 2 weeks, and at the top of a 4-month trading range. Traders are looking for reversals every few days and they are taking quick profits. Traders will continue to trade that way until there are consecutive closes above or below the range. There is nothing compelling going on right now, which means traders expect reversals.<h3 id=\"20-might-get-2nd-leg-down-from-september-high\">Might get 2nd leg down from September high</h3><p>The last time that the Emini was clearly trending strongly was at the September 2 high. Everything since then has been disappointing for the bulls and the bears. Consequently, everything since then is probably still a sideways pullback from the September 2 high.<p>It is possible that the 3-month trading range is just a complex 2-legged correction. The 1st leg down ended with the September 24 low.<p>While it is possible that the October 30 low was a 2nd leg down and the end of the correction, it is equally possible that the 2nd leg down has not yet begun. Sometimes there is a trading range after a 1st leg down, and then there is a 2nd leg down.<p>Given how disappointing the rallies have been, there is at least a 50% chance that the November rally is simply a pullback from the 1st leg down. If so, the rally will probably not go much higher before the 2nd leg down begins. The objective would be a test of the bottom of the 1st leg down, which is the September 24 low and the bottom of the 4-month trading range.<h2 id=\"21-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is both a buy and sell signal bar for today. With the bear body, it is a stronger sell setup than buy setup. The bears want a reversal down from the November 9/November 16 double top and a failed breakout above the September high.<p>Last week was the 2nd consecutive bear bar on the weekly chart. It, too, was an inside bar, and it is therefore also both a buy and a sell signal bar for this week. Again, because it had a bear body, it is a weaker buy signal bar.<p>The Emini has been in a trading range for 2 weeks. Traders expect reversals both on the daily chart and on the 5-minute chart. Also, most of the days over the past 3 weeks had reversals and closed near the open or middle of the day’s range. Traders will expect that again today unless there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 14 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open around the top of Friday’s late sell climax, reversing that selloff. The bulls want a breakout above Thursday’s high, which is the neckline of a 2-day micro double bottom. They then hope for a trend day that begins a move back up to the top of the 3-week trading range.<p>The bears are beginning with a disadvantage. Friday was a bear day on the daily chart and a sell signal bar on the daily chart. But instead of today opening near Friday’s low, the Emini is going to open near Friday’s high. That significantly reduces the chance that today will be a big bear day.<p>But it does not necessarily mean that today will be a big bull day. As I said, most of the days over the past 3 weeks have had swings up and down. That is what traders will expect today. However, if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, day traders will look for a trend day instead of a trading range day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-trading-range-day-with-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-23.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Until there are consecutive closes above or below the range, traders will continue to look for reversals.<p>Today’s high is also above last week’s high. Today is therefore triggering a High 1 bull flag buy signal in the weekly chart (<a aria-label=\"I showed the chart over the weekend (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-bear-bars-weekly-chart-september-high/#6-eurusd-weekly-chart-formed-an-bull-inside-bar-and-high-1-buy-signal-bar-but-at-top-of-9-week-tight-trading-range\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">I showed the chart over the weekend</a>). But today’s breakout so far is small. Also, the EURUSD twice tried to break above the September 10 high last week, but both days reversed down.<h3>What does a successful breakout look like?</h3><p>Will the bulls succeed this time? There are 2 common ways that a bull breakout succeeds. First, there can be a big bull bar closing far above the resistance. There is still time for this today, but there is no sign that it is about to happen.<p>Next, there can be a series of small bull days, with 2 or more of the closes above the breakout point. Therefore, even though today’s range is not big, the breakout could still be this gradual type over the next few days.<p>The key for the bulls is to have today close above the open, and preferably near the high. Then, the bulls will try to get either a series of bull days that gradually close above the September 10/November 9 double top, or a big bull bar closing far above that resistance.<p>About half of triangle breakouts fail. Therefore, the bears will try to get a reversal down this week. They want either a day that rallies and then reverses down and closes on its low, or a very big bear bar closing far below the bull trend line at the bottom of the triangle.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied briefly overnight to slightly above Friday’s high and last week’s high, but it then has been sideways for 3 hours. The bulls are trying to continue the breakout to above the November 9 high, and then have the day close above that high. At a minimum, they want today to have a bull body and close above Friday’s high. That would increase the chance of a breakout above the November 9 high tomorrow.<p>Will the bulls get their breakout or will the bears get a reversal today? Right now, it looks like the bulls are simply trying to keep the day near the high. They have been buying pullbacks, but they have not been buying at the high. With the chart sideways for 3 hours, the bulls have switched to scalping, while hoping for the breakout.<p>The pullbacks have only been 15 pips overnight. That is not enough to make day traders short. If the 5-minute chart continues sideways and forms a double top, the bears will begin to short, hoping for a reversal day. But right now, day traders are only buying for scalps and hoping for a big bull breakout or a big reversal down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But Friday was a big bear day, which is a bad buy signal bar. There were likely to be sellers above Friday’s high, and there were. The Emini sold off on the open for 2 hours, but held above Friday’s Low. It reversed back up for the rest of the day.<p>Today closed near the September high, which has been the most important magnet for 3 weeks. Furthermore, it closed near the open. The majority of the days for the past 3 weeks closed either near the open or middle of the day’s range.<p>Today is the 3rd consecutive sideways day in the bottom half of a 3-week trading range. The market is in Breakout Mode. The bulls see a double bottom and the bears see a double top. There is generally a 50% chance of a successful breakout in either direction. But the trading range is following a strong rally. Therefore, the odds of a bull breakout are slightly higher than for a bear breakout.<p>With so many reversals over the past several weeks, traders will continue to look for reversals every 1 – 3 days on the daily chart, and on most days on the 5-minute chart.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It reversed back up for the rest of the day.<p>Today closed near the September high, which has been the most important magnet for 3 weeks. Furthermore, it closed near the open. The majority of the days for the past 3 weeks closed either near the open or middle of the day’s range.<p>Today is the 3rd consecutive sideways day in the bottom half of a 3-week trading range. The market is in Breakout Mode. The bulls see a double bottom and the bears see a double top. There is generally a 50% chance of a successful breakout in either direction. But the trading range is following a strong rally. Therefore, the odds of a bull breakout are slightly higher than for a bear breakout.<p>With so many reversals over the past several weeks, traders will continue to look for reversals every 1 – 3 days on the daily chart, and on most days on the 5-minute chart.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is both a buy and sell signal bar for today. With the bear body, it is a stronger sell setup than buy setup. The bears want a reversal down from the November 9/November 16 double top and a failed breakout above the September high.<p>Last week was the 2nd consecutive bear bar on the weekly chart. It, too, was an inside bar, and it is therefore also both a buy and a sell signal bar for this week. Again, because it had a bear body, it is a weaker buy signal bar.<p>The Emini has been in a trading range for 2 weeks. Traders expect reversals both on the daily chart and on the 5-minute chart. Also, most of the days over the past 3 weeks had reversals and closed near the open or middle of the day’s range. Traders will expect that again today unless there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 14 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open around the top of Friday’s late sell climax, reversing that selloff. The bulls want a breakout above Thursday’s high, which is the neckline of a 2-day micro double bottom. They then hope for a trend day that begins a move back up to the top of the 3-week trading range.<p>The bears are beginning with a disadvantage. Friday was a bear day on the daily chart and a sell signal bar on the daily chart. But instead of today opening near Friday’s low, the Emini is going to open near Friday’s high. That significantly reduces the chance that today will be a big bear day.<p>But it does not necessarily mean that today will be a big bull day. As I said, most of the days over the past 3 weeks have had swings up and down. That is what traders will expect today. However, if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, day traders will look for a trend day instead of a trading range day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-trading-range-day-with-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-23.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-above-triangle-but-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-23-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex breakout above triangle but in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is breaking above its 2-week triangle, but it is still below the September 10 lower high and the top of the 4-month trading range. Until there are consecutive closes above or below the range, traders will continue to look for reversals.<p>Today’s high is also above last week’s high. Today is therefore triggering a High 1 bull flag buy signal in the weekly chart (<a aria-label=\"I showed the chart over the weekend (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-bear-bars-weekly-chart-september-high/#6-eurusd-weekly-chart-formed-an-bull-inside-bar-and-high-1-buy-signal-bar-but-at-top-of-9-week-tight-trading-range\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">I showed the chart over the weekend</a>). But today’s breakout so far is small. Also, the EURUSD twice tried to break above the September 10 high last week, but both days reversed down.<h3>What does a successful breakout look like?</h3><p>Will the bulls succeed this time? There are 2 common ways that a bull breakout succeeds. First, there can be a big bull bar closing far above the resistance. There is still time for this today, but there is no sign that it is about to happen.<p>Next, there can be a series of small bull days, with 2 or more of the closes above the breakout point. Therefore, even though today’s range is not big, the breakout could still be this gradual type over the next few days.<p>The key for the bulls is to have today close above the open, and preferably near the high. Then, the bulls will try to get either a series of bull days that gradually close above the September 10/November 9 double top, or a big bull bar closing far above that resistance.<p>About half of triangle breakouts fail. Therefore, the bears will try to get a reversal down this week. They want either a day that rallies and then reverses down and closes on its low, or a very big bear bar closing far below the bull trend line at the bottom of the triangle.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied briefly overnight to slightly above Friday’s high and last week’s high, but it then has been sideways for 3 hours. The bulls are trying to continue the breakout to above the November 9 high, and then have the day close above that high. At a minimum, they want today to have a bull body and close above Friday’s high. That would increase the chance of a breakout above the November 9 high tomorrow.<p>Will the bulls get their breakout or will the bears get a reversal today? Right now, it looks like the bulls are simply trying to keep the day near the high. They have been buying pullbacks, but they have not been buying at the high. With the chart sideways for 3 hours, the bulls have switched to scalping, while hoping for the breakout.<p>The pullbacks have only been 15 pips overnight. That is not enough to make day traders short. If the 5-minute chart continues sideways and forms a double top, the bears will begin to short, hoping for a reversal day. But right now, day traders are only buying for scalps and hoping for a big bull breakout or a big reversal down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But since Friday was a big bear bar, there were likely to be more sellers than buyers above its high, and there were.<p>The Emini sold off yesterday, tested Friday’s low, and then reversed up to close near the open of the day. Most days for 3 weeks have closed near the open or in the middle of the day’s range, and both are signs of neutrality. The Emini also closed near the September high, which has been the most important magnet for 3 weeks.<p>The bulls are hoping that today will continue yesterday’s rally. The bulls see the 3-week trading range as a double bottom. The bears, however, see it as a double top, and want a break below the range.<p>The 3-week trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is a generally a 50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout, and there is no evidence that a breakout is imminent. But since the trading range came after a strong rally, the probability is slightly better than 50% for the bulls.<p>It is important to note that most days over the past 3 weeks have had at least one reversal on the 5-minute chart. Day traders will continue to look for intraday reversals until there are several strong consecutive bars up or down on the 5-minute chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 28 points in the Globex session. Today will probably gap above yesterday’s high, the September high, and the 3600 Big Round Number. The bulls want to break above last week’s high, which would trigger a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the weekly chart.<p>Today will also open with a big gap up from yesterday’s close on the 5-minute chart. The Emini will then be far above the EMA, which is a measure of the average price. When a market is far above the average price, traders will only buy if the bars look far more bullish than average.<p>Most of the time, the bars are not strong enough. The result is that the legs up and down do not get far. The Emini usually enters a trading range for the 1st hour or two until the EMA rises to the bars.<p>Because of the likely early trading range, day traders will look to sell a double top or wedge rally for a selloff down to the EMA. Once the Emini is near the EMA, they will look for a double bottom or wedge bottom for a swing up.<p>About 20% of the time, the Emini forms a trend bar right from the early bars, and the trend lasts all day. But an early trading range is more common.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-24.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Double top and double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart so far today has a high below yesterday’s high and a low above yesterday’s low. It is an inside day after an outside day, and there is now an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. It follows a small breakout above and below a 2-week triangle. Additionally, that followed a 4-week expanding triangle. All of it is within a 4-month trading range, and everything is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Traders know that there will eventually be a successful breakout in either direction, but they also know that reversals are more likely than breakouts when the market is sideways. Consequently, they are unwilling to hold onto positions for more than a few days. Once there are consecutive closes above or below the 4-month range, they then will hold part of their position for what they hope will be a 400-pip measured move, based on the height of the trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market opened in the middle of yesterday’s range, rallied slightly, and pulled back. The rally was a test of yesterday’s sell climax high on the 5-minute chart. Once it got there, it pulled back, which usually happens when a market tests a sell climax high.<p>Today’s range has been small, and today so far is an inside day. Traders might be betting that today will remain an inside day. There would then be an ioi pattern on the daily chart, and swing traders would try for a trend day up or down tomorrow. So far today, day traders have been scalping for 10 to 20 pips.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-buy-climax-and-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-24-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The rally was a Small Pullback Bull Trend, but it was climactic and profit-takers came in just above last week’s high. Remember, last week was a High 1 buy signal bar on the weekly chart, but I have been saying that it was a weak buy setup because last week and the week before were bear bars.<p>It is common for a Bull Trend From The Open to get exhausted after a couple hours and then enter a tight trading range. Today was an example. Then, tomorrow, traders decide whether to resume the trend or create a reversal down. The momentum up is strong enough to make a new high more likely.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But since Friday was a big bear bar, there were likely to be more sellers than buyers above its high, and there were.<p>The Emini sold off yesterday, tested Friday’s low, and then reversed up to close near the open of the day. Most days for 3 weeks have closed near the open or in the middle of the day’s range, and both are signs of neutrality. The Emini also closed near the September high, which has been the most important magnet for 3 weeks.<p>The bulls are hoping that today will continue yesterday’s rally. The bulls see the 3-week trading range as a double bottom. The bears, however, see it as a double top, and want a break below the range.<p>The 3-week trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is a generally a 50% chance of a successful bull or bear breakout, and there is no evidence that a breakout is imminent. But since the trading range came after a strong rally, the probability is slightly better than 50% for the bulls.<p>It is important to note that most days over the past 3 weeks have had at least one reversal on the 5-minute chart. Day traders will continue to look for intraday reversals until there are several strong consecutive bars up or down on the 5-minute chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 28 points in the Globex session. Today will probably gap above yesterday’s high, the September high, and the 3600 Big Round Number. The bulls want to break above last week’s high, which would trigger a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the weekly chart.<p>Today will also open with a big gap up from yesterday’s close on the 5-minute chart. The Emini will then be far above the EMA, which is a measure of the average price. When a market is far above the average price, traders will only buy if the bars look far more bullish than average.<p>Most of the time, the bars are not strong enough. The result is that the legs up and down do not get far. The Emini usually enters a trading range for the 1st hour or two until the EMA rises to the bars.<p>Because of the likely early trading range, day traders will look to sell a double top or wedge rally for a selloff down to the EMA. Once the Emini is near the EMA, they will look for a double bottom or wedge bottom for a swing up.<p>About 20% of the time, the Emini forms a trend bar right from the early bars, and the trend lasts all day. But an early trading range is more common.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-24.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Double top and double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart so far today has a high below yesterday’s high and a low above yesterday’s low. It is an inside day after an outside day, and there is now an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. It follows a small breakout above and below a 2-week triangle. Additionally, that followed a 4-week expanding triangle. All of it is within a 4-month trading range, and everything is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Traders know that there will eventually be a successful breakout in either direction, but they also know that reversals are more likely than breakouts when the market is sideways. Consequently, they are unwilling to hold onto positions for more than a few days. Once there are consecutive closes above or below the 4-month range, they then will hold part of their position for what they hope will be a 400-pip measured move, based on the height of the trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market opened in the middle of yesterday’s range, rallied slightly, and pulled back. The rally was a test of yesterday’s sell climax high on the 5-minute chart. Once it got there, it pulled back, which usually happens when a market tests a sell climax high.<p>Today’s range has been small, and today so far is an inside day. Traders might be betting that today will remain an inside day. There would then be an ioi pattern on the daily chart, and swing traders would try for a trend day up or down tomorrow. So far today, day traders have been scalping for 10 to 20 pips.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-buy-climax-and-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-24-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It was a bull bar that closed on its high. Because the all-time high is only 6.5 points above yesterday’s high and yesterday rallied strongly, traders expect another attempt at a new high today. This is especially true with the Emini breaking above the day session all-time high in today’s Globex session. It did not break above the November 9 all-time Globex high.<p>Can today break far above the old day session high? Why not? Will it? Probably not because there have been so many reversals over the past 3 weeks, and most days have had a lot of trading range price action. However, the Emini will probably break at least a little above the all-time high today or soon.<p>Remember that tomorrow is Thanksgiving and there might be less interest in trading today. When I started trading back in the 1980’s, there were no computer algorithms. All trading was done in the pits with traders flashing signals to one another. The day before a holiday was usually small because lots of traders left early for the holiday.<p>That is less an issue today because most of the volume is now being traded by computer algorithms. There is more potential for today to be a normal day.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini rallied strongly yesterday on the 5-minute chart and then went sideways. The bulls see the trading range as a bull flag. The all-time high and the Globex high are magnets above. Traders expect at least some trend resumption up today.<p>Because of yesterday’s strong bull trend and the magnets above, there is an increased chance of at least a 1 or 2 hour rally to above those magnets this morning. Also, there is euphoria over the election being settled, and markets sometimes break far above resistance. There is therefore an increased chance of a bull trend day.<p>Traders know that yesterday’s 4-hour trading range is a bull flag. But they also know that when a trading range has more than 20 bars in it, the market is getting close to neutral. The bears want a trend reversal down either from the tight trading range or from a bull breakout that fails. They want to see at least a couple big bear bars closing below the bottom of yesterday’s trading range to confirm the reversal down.<p>Because today is at a critical price on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of a trend day up or down. However, day traders know that most days in November have had a lot of trading range price action, and at least one swing up and one swing down. They are assuming that today will be like that unless there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction. If they get that, they will look for a trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-buy-climax-and-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-25.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then buy climax and trading range.

However, the breakout was small, and the EURUSD is currently trading back near the open of the session, and below the September 10 high.<p>So far, this is a weak breakout. While the bulls want today to close far above the September 10 high, their minimum goal is for today to close above the open. It would then have a bull body, and that would increase the chance that the bulls will try for the breakout again over the next few trading days.<p>The bears want the breakout to fail and for the EURUSD to reverse down to the bottom of the 4-month trading range. If today is a bear reversal bar closing on its low, traders will expect lower prices tomorrow. That would increase the chance of a reversal down.<h3>Daily chart continuing to form new Breakout Mode patterns</h3><p>The daily chart is repeatedly forming Breakout Mode patterns. Instead of the EURUSD breaking out of a pattern, the pattern evolves into another Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Since the daily chart is still in Breakout Mode, traders believe the chance of a bull breakout is about the same as for a bear breakout. They are unwilling to hold onto positions for more than a day or so as they wait for a breakout.<p>The bulls want to see a couple closes above the September 10 high and then above the September 1 high. The bears want to see a strong reversal down and then a couple closes below the November 11 low, and then the November 4 low. Until either of those breakouts forms, traders will continue to look for reversals.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke briefly above the November 9 high at the top of the 3-month trading range overnight and then reversed down. Both the breakout and the reversal were small. Today so far is a small trading range day.<p>Because of the breakout to a new 3-month high, there is an increased chance of a conversion to a trend day in either direction. However, so far, day traders are scalping for 10 pips up and down. There is no sign that this is about to change before the end of the day.<p>The key prices are the open of the day and the November 9 high. The bulls want the day to close above both and the bears want the day to close below both.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is both a buy and sell signal bar for Friday.<p>The Emini has been stuck for 2 days around last week’s high. Last week is a High 1 buy signal bar on the weekly chart. But it was a bear bar and therefore a weak setup. Yesterday went above last week’s high and triggered the buy signal. However, as I said was likely, there were a lot of traders looking to sell above a bad buy signal bar.<p>Friday has an early close. The day after Thanksgiving typically has a small range. If the bars on Friday are small and sideways for the 1st hour, the rest of the day will likely be quiet, and it will probably better to not trade.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That would increase the chance of a reversal down.<h3>Daily chart continuing to form new Breakout Mode patterns</h3><p>The daily chart is repeatedly forming Breakout Mode patterns. Instead of the EURUSD breaking out of a pattern, the pattern evolves into another Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Since the daily chart is still in Breakout Mode, traders believe the chance of a bull breakout is about the same as for a bear breakout. They are unwilling to hold onto positions for more than a day or so as they wait for a breakout.<p>The bulls want to see a couple closes above the September 10 high and then above the September 1 high. The bears want to see a strong reversal down and then a couple closes below the November 11 low, and then the November 4 low. Until either of those breakouts forms, traders will continue to look for reversals.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke briefly above the November 9 high at the top of the 3-month trading range overnight and then reversed down. Both the breakout and the reversal were small. Today so far is a small trading range day.<p>Because of the breakout to a new 3-month high, there is an increased chance of a conversion to a trend day in either direction. However, so far, day traders are scalping for 10 pips up and down. There is no sign that this is about to change before the end of the day.<p>The key prices are the open of the day and the November 9 high. The bulls want the day to close above both and the bears want the day to close below both.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It was a bull bar that closed on its high. Because the all-time high is only 6.5 points above yesterday’s high and yesterday rallied strongly, traders expect another attempt at a new high today. This is especially true with the Emini breaking above the day session all-time high in today’s Globex session. It did not break above the November 9 all-time Globex high.<p>Can today break far above the old day session high? Why not? Will it? Probably not because there have been so many reversals over the past 3 weeks, and most days have had a lot of trading range price action. However, the Emini will probably break at least a little above the all-time high today or soon.<p>Remember that tomorrow is Thanksgiving and there might be less interest in trading today. When I started trading back in the 1980’s, there were no computer algorithms. All trading was done in the pits with traders flashing signals to one another. The day before a holiday was usually small because lots of traders left early for the holiday.<p>That is less an issue today because most of the volume is now being traded by computer algorithms. There is more potential for today to be a normal day.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini rallied strongly yesterday on the 5-minute chart and then went sideways. The bulls see the trading range as a bull flag. The all-time high and the Globex high are magnets above. Traders expect at least some trend resumption up today.<p>Because of yesterday’s strong bull trend and the magnets above, there is an increased chance of at least a 1 or 2 hour rally to above those magnets this morning. Also, there is euphoria over the election being settled, and markets sometimes break far above resistance. There is therefore an increased chance of a bull trend day.<p>Traders know that yesterday’s 4-hour trading range is a bull flag. But they also know that when a trading range has more than 20 bars in it, the market is getting close to neutral. The bears want a trend reversal down either from the tight trading range or from a bull breakout that fails. They want to see at least a couple big bear bars closing below the bottom of yesterday’s trading range to confirm the reversal down.<p>Because today is at a critical price on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of a trend day up or down. However, day traders know that most days in November have had a lot of trading range price action, and at least one swing up and one swing down. They are assuming that today will be like that unless there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction. If they get that, they will look for a trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-buy-climax-and-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-25.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then buy climax and trading range.

However, the breakout was small, and the EURUSD is currently trading back near the open of the session, and below the September 10 high.<p>So far, this is a weak breakout. While the bulls want today to close far above the September 10 high, their minimum goal is for today to close above the open. It would then have a bull body, and that would increase the chance that the bulls will try for the breakout again over the next few trading days.<p>The bears want the breakout to fail and for the EURUSD to reverse down to the bottom of the 4-month trading range.

It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for today.<p>Some brokers show Thursday on their charts. Thursday was a bear day and it traded below Wednesday’s low. While the bears see it as the start of a reversal down, it is also a pullback from Monday’s rally. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. But because it has a bear body, it is a weak buy setup.<p>On the weekly chart, last week was a High 1 buy signal bar. The bulls will try to get this week to close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>It is important to note that today has an early close at 10:15 AM PST. If today has a lot of small, sideways bars for the 1st hour, it will probably be better to not trade and instead wait for Monday.<p>Can today be a big trend day? The day after Thanksgiving is usually small. Therefore, if there is a trend, it will probably not be big. But if there are a few consecutive trend bars up or down early in the day, day traders will look for a swing trade.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 23 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap above yesterday’s high. If so, the gap will be relatively small. The smaller a gap is, the more likely it will close.<p>Is this one so small that it should close? It’s borderline. The bulls will buy an early, brief selloff and try to keep the gap open. There is therefore an increased chance of an early low of the day, and then a bull trend day.<p>Yesterday’s range was small. Therefore, if today gaps up and has several consecutive bear bars, traders will look for a bear trend, and a possible break below yesterday’s low. Today would then be an outside down day at the top of a 3 week range. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want this week to close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>Today will probably have a small range. If there is going to be a trend, up is more likely. But, a small day with an early close does not offer a lot of profit potential. Day traders will look for early signs of a trend and then enter early, hoping for to capture as much profit as they can in what will probably be a small day.<p>While a big trend day is unlikely, if there are several big bars in one direction in the 1st hour, traders will be more aggressive. That could create a big trend day.<h2>Wednesday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-27.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day and inside day.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Wednesday.

The bulls want a breakout and then a test of the September 1 high. That is the top of a 4-month trading range and the highest price in 2 years.<p>Throughout November, the bulls have been trying to get a close above the September 10 high. At the moment, the EURUSD is just above that high. If today can close above that high, traders will expect higher prices next week. The next resistance is the September 1 high.<p>If a market repeatedly tries to do something but fails, it usually then tries to do the opposite. If there is suddenly a big bear bar closing on its low within the next week, traders will conclude that the bulls are selling out of their longs and giving up. That should probably lead to a test of support at the November 4 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 15-pip range for the past 8 hours. Day traders are having a difficult time making even a 10-pip scalp.<p>But what is important today is that the overnight trading range is just above the September 10 high. The bulls will be happy having the range last until the close. If it does, the EURUSD will have closed above that top of the 3-month trading range for the 1st time.<p>Also, on the weekly chart, this week will be an outside up bar closing on its high. Both of these charts will probably trade higher next week. Traders will expect a test of the September 1 high within a couple weeks.<p>Since today is at a critical price, there is an increased chance of a surprisingly big day in either direction. But with many US traders and institutions not trading today, the day will probably remain small. The focus will be the close. Can the bulls finally get a close above the September 10 high?<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-consecutive-wedge-bottoms-and-climactic-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini consecutive wedge bottoms and climactic reversal up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The Emini had a small wedge rally to a double top and that remained the high of the day. The selloff formed consecutive wedge bottoms and the bulls got a reversal back up to near the open. Today was a bear doji bar on the daily chart.<p>While the bears want a reversal down from a double top, the momentum up 3 weeks ago was strong enough for traders to expect a new all-time high next week. Monday might even gap to a new high. That gap would also be present on the weekly chart.<p>On the weekly chart, this week closed on its high and above last week’s high. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices and probably a new all-time high next week.<p>Monday is the final day of the month. The bulls want November to close at a new all-time high. Since November is a big bull bar, traders expect at least slightly higher prices in December.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls want a breakout and then a test of the September 1 high. That is the top of a 4-month trading range and the highest price in 2 years.<p>Throughout November, the bulls have been trying to get a close above the September 10 high. At the moment, the EURUSD is just above that high. If today can close above that high, traders will expect higher prices next week. The next resistance is the September 1 high.<p>If a market repeatedly tries to do something but fails, it usually then tries to do the opposite. If there is suddenly a big bear bar closing on its low within the next week, traders will conclude that the bulls are selling out of their longs and giving up. That should probably lead to a test of support at the November 4 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 15-pip range for the past 8 hours. Day traders are having a difficult time making even a 10-pip scalp.<p>But what is important today is that the overnight trading range is just above the September 10 high. The bulls will be happy having the range last until the close. If it does, the EURUSD will have closed above that top of the 3-month trading range for the 1st time.<p>Also, on the weekly chart, this week will be an outside up bar closing on its high. Both of these charts will probably trade higher next week. Traders will expect a test of the September 1 high within a couple weeks.<p>Since today is at a critical price, there is an increased chance of a surprisingly big day in either direction. But with many US traders and institutions not trading today, the day will probably remain small. The focus will be the close. Can the bulls finally get a close above the September 10 high?<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-consecutive-wedge-bottoms-and-climactic-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini consecutive wedge bottoms and climactic reversal up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for today.<p>Some brokers show Thursday on their charts. Thursday was a bear day and it traded below Wednesday’s low. While the bears see it as the start of a reversal down, it is also a pullback from Monday’s rally. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. But because it has a bear body, it is a weak buy setup.<p>On the weekly chart, last week was a High 1 buy signal bar. The bulls will try to get this week to close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>It is important to note that today has an early close at 10:15 AM PST. If today has a lot of small, sideways bars for the 1st hour, it will probably be better to not trade and instead wait for Monday.<p>Can today be a big trend day? The day after Thanksgiving is usually small. Therefore, if there is a trend, it will probably not be big. But if there are a few consecutive trend bars up or down early in the day, day traders will look for a swing trade.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 23 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap above yesterday’s high. If so, the gap will be relatively small. The smaller a gap is, the more likely it will close.<p>Is this one so small that it should close? It’s borderline. The bulls will buy an early, brief selloff and try to keep the gap open. There is therefore an increased chance of an early low of the day, and then a bull trend day.<p>Yesterday’s range was small. Therefore, if today gaps up and has several consecutive bear bars, traders will look for a bear trend, and a possible break below yesterday’s low. Today would then be an outside down day at the top of a 3 week range. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want this week to close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p>Today will probably have a small range. If there is going to be a trend, up is more likely. But, a small day with an early close does not offer a lot of profit potential. Day traders will look for early signs of a trend and then enter early, hoping for to capture as much profit as they can in what will probably be a small day.<p>While a big trend day is unlikely, if there are several big bars in one direction in the 1st hour, traders will be more aggressive. That could create a big trend day.<h2>Wednesday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-27.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day and inside day.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Wednesday.

strongly in November, but most of the bars on the daily chart have been weak. This makes the rally more likely to be a bull leg in a trading range that started in September, and the start of a measured move up. Emini futures down probably on next 10% move.<p><strong>Gold futures</strong>are turning down on the weekly chart. This is probably the start of a trading range that will last many months.<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong>is pulling back from a parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart. Traders should expect at least a few weeks of sideways trading.<h2 id=\"1-gold-futures-\"><strong>Gold futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-gold-futures-weekly-chart-turning-down-from-wedge-buy-climax-just-below-2011-all-time-high\">Gold futures<em><strong>weekly</strong></em>chart turning down from wedge buy climax just below 2011 all-time high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gold-weekly-candlestick-chart-reversing-down-from-double-top-and-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-28.png\" alt=\"Gold weekly candlestick chart reversing down from double top and parabolic wedge buy climax.png\"></a></figure><p>The weekly gold futures chart has sold off since the August high. The reasons I am showing it is to remind traders that TV experts are stupid, and to explain some things that are going on in the Emini and bond futures markets.<p>If you watched any financial show this summer, you repeatedly heard how gold was early in a bull trend and that it was going far above the 2011 all-time high. The soundbite was “interest rates to zero and gold to infinity!” All of the experts were linking the two.<p>Where have the experts gone now that gold is down almost 15% from the high? No one is talking about gold now, because they don’t want to remind everyone about how bullish they were in August when gold was testing the top of a buy climax and testing the 2011 all-time high.<h3 id=\"3-what-next\">What next?</h3><p>The bears are hoping that the gold market is forming a double top with the 2011 high. They want a bear trend reversal. The rally since the August 2019 high has had 3 legs up. The bears hope that this is a wedge rally to a double top with the 2011 high. They know that this is a reliable reversal pattern.<p>A reversal down from a buy climax typically has at least a couple legs sideways to down. The current selloff is now in its 3rd leg down. But since the 3-month selloff is in a tight bear channel, it is probably a complex 1st leg down. If so, traders will expect the 1st rally to fail. They then would look for a 2nd leg down.<p>At that point, if there is a reliable setup, they might buy for a resumption back up to the 2011 high. More likely, the weekly chart will enter a trading range. This process will take 20 or more bars, which means 6 months or more.<p>This selloff is now in search of an initial bottom. A reasonable target would be around the June low, which is a little more than a 50% retracement of the rally that began in March.<p>A wedge reversal often retraces to the start of the wedge bull channel. That is the March low. That is also at the July 2016 high, which is the top of the 2013 to 2019 trading range.<h3 id=\"4-the-news-is-always-extremely-bullish-just-before-a-reversal-down\">The news is always extremely bullish just before a reversal down</h3><p>It is important to understand that when a market is in a buy climax, the news is always extremely bullish. It has to be, otherwise the market would not be racing up.<p>But the mistake is to assume that the news is right. The experts on TV are constantly giving all of the reasons why the trend is early, and it will go much higher. They are very confident, and they arrogantly look down at the fools who are not already long. They wear nice suits and have impressive titles, but they are idiots.<h3 id=\"5-the-church-of-gold\">The church of gold</h3><p>This is especially true in the gold market, which is more of a religion than a commodity. When it is up, they say you must buy because it is going higher. When it is down, they tell you that you must buy because it will soon race back up to the high.<p>Ask them what would make them sell. They will tell you that there is never a reason to sell, and there is always a reason to buy.<p>Do you think that is useful advice? If you bought gold for $2,100 in 2011 and watched it lose 40% of its value in 6 years, do you think that was the best choice for your money? Gold is not always the best choice. In fact, it rarely is the best choice. Most of the time, some other market will make more money for you.<h3 id=\"6-buy-climaxes-lead-to-profit-taking\">Buy climaxes lead to profit-taking</h3><p>Now, why does a market reverse down from a strong bull trend? You cannot have a buy climax unless everyone is bullish. FOMO… Fear Of Missing Out. Smart traders buy early and look for an extreme buy climax to take profits. They buy low and sell high. Also, smart bears start to short when there is an extreme rally, and they sell more higher.<p>The last buyers are the momentum traders. And don’t forget the dumb money traders who missed the move. They believe all of the hype and are desperate to buy at any price.<p>The momentum traders are buying because the market is going up. Once it stops going up, they quickly exit. Their panic selling once they sense that the bulls are starting to take profits accelerates the reversal down.<p>They are not investors, who are willing to use wide stops or no stop at all. Investors will buy more during a collapse because they are in it for the long haul. They are confident that gold will be higher 10 or 20 years from now, and will use selloffs to buy until they have the desired amount in their portfolio.<h3 id=\"7-golden-lambs-to-the-slaughter-house\">Golden lambs to the slaughter house</h3><p>The dumb money traders, who follow the gold gurus on TV, buy at the top and hold until after the crash. They then exit with a big loss. They do not understand the risk of buying during a buy climax.<p>Very importantly, they do not have a plan to exit. They do not think about whether they are momentum buyers or investors. Remember, a momentum buyer exits quickly when the rally slows down. Investors buy more after a big selloff.<p>Dumb money does not have a plan. They expect the gold tree to grow to the sky, like the guy on TV says. When gold sells off, they are faced with a reality that is very different. They suddenly decide that they are not willing to sit through a 6-year bear trend that erases 40% if their money. And the TV guy is nowhere to be found to help them manage their bad trade.<h3 id=\"8-interest-rates-bottoming-after-30-year-bear-trend\">Interest rates bottoming after 30-year bear trend</h3><p>Because of that linkage between interest rates and gold, I want to summarize that I have been saying about the bond market since the March buy climax. I have talked about the bond market for years, saying that it is near the end of a 30-year bull trend and that it will fall for at least a decade. Remember, the bond market moves opposite to interest rates. As bonds fall, interest rates rise.<p>I said that interest rates could not hit zero in the U.S., and that they will work higher over the next decade. The bond futures market could briefly go above the March high, but at this point, it is more likely that it will not. If they rally over the next several months, the rally should fail around or below the old high. They could stay sideways for several more years, but they will be higher 5 years from now, and higher still 5 years after that.<p>So much for “interest rates to zero and gold to infinity.”<h2 id=\"9-bitcoin-market-\"><strong>Bitcoin market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"10-bitcoin-daily-chart-is-turning-down-from-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-test-of-all-time-high\">Bitcoin<strong><em>daily</em></strong>chart is turning down from parabolic wedge buy climax and test of all-time high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Bitcoin-daily-candlestick-chart-reversing-down-from-double-top-and-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-28-1.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin daily candlestick chart reversing down from double top and parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The Bitcoin cash index daily chart has rallied 5-fold since the March low. Pundits portray bitcoin as a replacement for gold as a storehouse of value. The news often describes it as “digital gold,” implying that people are selling gold and using the money to buy bitcoin. While this is true to some extent, it is impossible to know how significant it is. I suspect not very.<p>The 3-month selloff in gold happened as bitcoin went up 500%. Is this as cause and effect? No, because there are many reasons to own gold that are unrelated to bitcoin, and many reasons to own bitcoin that have nothing to do with gold. However, they have had a strong inverse correlation over the past several months, and the TV financial news often says that some of the money going into bitcoin is coming out of gold.<h3 id=\"11-bitcoin-has-reliable-chart-patterns\">Bitcoin has reliable chart patterns</h3><p>What next? When you look at the daily chart of bitcoin over the past 2 years, you can see that there are many traditional chart patterns. You should expect that with all markets that have lots of participants.<p>This is because a chart is simply a map of rational human behavior. That behavior is coded in our genes. Until we evolve into another species, the behavior will remain the same. It does not matter if you are trading stocks, baseball cards, or bitcoin. If you remove the labels, the charts would look the same.<h3 id=\"12-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax\">Parabolic wedge buy climax</h3><p>As strong as the 5-week rally has been, there are 3 legs up in a tight bull channel. The rally is therefore a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>Buy climaxes typically attract profit-takers. If a bull takes profits, he is not going to buy again 1 bar later. He is concerned that the profit-taking could be strong enough to lead to a deep selloff or even a bear trend.<p>The bulls still want to buy, but they like to wait until after they see the bears try and fail at least twice, to create a trend reversal down. Therefore, a buy climax usually leads to at least a couple legs sideways to down.<p>If the bears fail to create a trend reversal down, then the bulls will buy again. They expect the bears to fail and give up, and for other bulls to buy again as well. They are looking for a resumption of the bull trend.<p>But if the bears create an endless pullback down, traders will conclude that the pullback has evolved into a bear trend. There is no sign of that at the moment.<p>More often, a big move up and the reversal down is a Big Up, Big Down pattern. That generates Big Confusion, and confusion is a hallmark of a trading range. This selloff is likely the start of a trading range that should last at least a month. The bulls will see the range as a bull flag. The bears will look for some kind of double top, in addition to the 2017/November 2020 double top. Therefore, traders expect bitcoin to go sideways for at least the next month.<h2 id=\"13-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"14-monthly-emini-chart-has-huge-bull-bar-in-november-but-october-was-a-bear-bar-and-therefore-weak-buy-signal-bar\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has huge bull bar in November, but October was a bear bar and therefore weak buy signal bar</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-SP500-Futures-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 Futures candlestick chart breaking above High 1 bull flag buy signal bar at all time high\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a big bull bar so far in November. There is one trading day left in the month. The bulls want November to close above the September high at a new all-time monthly high. That would increase the chance of higher prices in December. However, the bears want November to close back below the October high. That would reduce the chance of a strong December.<p>October was a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. When the Emini rallied above the October high, it triggered the monthly buy signal. The bulls want a resumption of the 5-month bull trend.<p>But the October buy signal bar was a bear candlestick. That is an unreliable buy signal bar. With it being the 2nd consecutive bear bar, it is even more unreliable. There will more likely be more sellers than buyers above the October high, even though there is no sign of them yet. The rally could last a couple months, but traders should expect a reversal down within a month or two.<p>The reversal down in September led to a 2-month pause in the bull trend. Since November is a big bull bar after a 5-month buy climax, it probably will be an exhaustive buy climax. If so, traders will expect at least a couple legs sideways to down once this climactic breakout ends. It should end in December. Consequently, traders should expect the Emini to be mostly sideways for the 1st half of 2021. That would increase the number of bars in the trading range than began in August.<h3 id=\"15-possible-gap-up-on-monthly-chart-on-tuesday\">Possible gap up on Monthly chart on Tuesday</h3><p>Monday is the final day of November. The Emini has been in a strong bull trend since the March low. If Tuesday gaps up to a new all-time high, there will be a rare gap up to a new all-time high on the monthly chart.<p>While the gap could be big on the daily chart, it will probably be small on the monthly chart. Small gaps typically close before the bar closes. If it stayed open through December, it would likely close in January or February.<h3 id=\"16-everyone-on-tv-is-bullish\">Everyone on TV is bullish</h3><p>What about the uniformly bullish experts on TV? If you’ve been trading for a few years, you might have noticed a pattern. There is an annual ritual. In November and December, the financial networks trot out an endless series of experts predicting that the next year will be up 10 to 20%. You don’t get on TV unless you are eager to say bullish things about the coming year. If they did not put you on last year, you have to make an even more outrageously bullish prediction this year to make sure you will be on TV.<p>Since most years are up, it is a safe thing to predict an up year. However, not all years are up. I will show the yearly chart at the end of the year. It is currently a big outside up bar. But that is not bullish when it comes late in a bull trend. The current bull trend is now 10 years old. The rally is now late.<p>More often, a big bar late in a bull trend attracts profit-takers. Therefore, both the monthly and yearly charts look like they are predicting a lack of a rally for the next 6 – 12 months.<p>Could the charts or my reading of the charts be wrong and the TV experts right? Absolutely. But the monthly and yearly charts look like they will lead to a sideways market for many months.<h2 id=\"17-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-weak-breakout-above-high-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart weak breakout above High 1 bull flag buy signal bar</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-weekly-SP500-Futures-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-weak-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-28-3.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly S&amp;P500 Futures candlestick chart breaking above weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar at all time high.png\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a pattern that is similar to the one on the monthly chart. There is a High 1 buy signal bar, and it was the 2nd consecutive bear bar.<p>Traders typically expect more sellers than buyers above a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. The market can sometimes rally for a couple bars (weeks), but it then usually reverses down a 2nd time. The 2nd reversal is usually more complex and lasts longer. While the pullback in September led to 2 sideways bars, if there is a pullback within the next few weeks, traders will expect at least a couple small legs sideways to down. They will look for a trading range lasting at least a month.<p>Can the Emini explode to the upside and begin a strong rally to the end of the year? The bulls have a 30% chance. However, with this week closing on the high and strong momentum up 3 weeks ago, next week should go above this week’s high.<h2 id=\"18-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-in-strong-rally-but-next-10-move-will-probably-be-down\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart in strong rally, but next 10% move will probably be down</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-daily-SP500-Futures-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-weak-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar-but-possible-double-top-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-28-4.png\" alt=\"Emini daily S&amp;P500 Futures candlestick chart breaking above weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar but possible double top\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a quick move up to the November 9 high, but then went sideways. I have talked about the bars in that rally and in November a few times. In November, about 75% of the bars closed either around their open or in the middle of the bar. Those are weak bars. Yet, the month is forming a huge bull bar on the monthly chart. Something is wrong here.<p>Bull trends usually have lots of bull bars closing near their highs. Look back at the summer rally as an example. If the November rally is not consistent with a bull trend, it might be a big bull leg in a trading range. As a general rule, if something does not look the way you think it should, the chart is probably forming a trading range.<p>If I’m right and this rally to a new all-time high is simply a strong bull leg in a trading range that began after the September 3 top, where is the top of the range? It is probably not much higher. As I wrote above, December could be another bull bar on the monthly chart, but traders should expect a trading range on the monthly chart by early next year.<h3 id=\"19-the-next-10-move-in-the-emini-will-probably-be-down-not-up\">The next 10% move in the Emini will probably be down, not up</h3><p>The bottom of the range will probably be around the September low. That is about 12% down from the current November high. Let’s say about 10% down. Since I think the November rally is part of a trading range, and not part of a successful breakout of the 400-point tall, 4-month trading range, then I am saying that the next 10% move in the Emini will probably be down and not up. We just don’t know when the move down will begin. I believe it will start in December or early January, and that it will come before the Emini rallies 10%.<p>Also, if the Emini gets down to near the September low, it will probably fall below. This is because traders would conclude that the Emini had entered a trading range, and legs in trading ranges tend to break beyond support and resistance before reversing. Therefore, if there is a selloff, it will probably be more like 15 to 20% instead of just 10%.<p>What would cause the selloff? It will be technical. The daily chart looks like it is in a trading range. It is now at the top and therefore it should go back to the bottom.<h3 id=\"20-news-reporters-are-narcissists-and-incorrectly-assume-everything-is-caused-by-the-news\">News reporters are narcissists and incorrectly assume everything is caused by the news</h3><p>There is news every day. Whatever the news is on the day the selloff begins will be what TV reporters will definitively claim as the reason for the selloff. That is because they believe that they are the center of the world. To them, everything is related to the news, which means to them. They cannot imagine that something else unrelated to the news, like technical factors, might be the real cause.<p>The news could be the catalyst, but the price action is already telling us that a selloff is likely. There are bad bull flags on the weekly and monthly charts and too many bars on the daily chart with weak closes.<p>Also, remember what I wrote last week. There is an increased chance of a surprise after January 5. What is the surprise? Who, knows? That’s what makes it a surprise!<h3 id=\"21-what-about-next-week\">What about next week?</h3><p>The momentum up in the rally from 3 weeks ago was strong enough to make a new high likely this week. As I mentioned above, November has been a very strong bar on the monthly chart. Traders should not be surprised by a gap up to a new all-time high on Tuesday when December begins. That could lead to an acceleration up for several days and even a couple weeks.<p>But it would probably be an exhaustive buy climax and the end of the rally from the March low. There is currently only a 30% chance that the breakout above the September high will lead to a 400-point measured move up.<h2 id=\"22-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders expect a new all-time high this week. In fact, today might even gap to a new all-time high. Since today is Monday, there would also be a gap on the weekly chart.<p>Can today reverse down from a double top with the November 9 high? It is more likely that the Emini will go up at least a little above that high. But if today is a big bear day, the double top will become more credible.<p>Today is the final day of the month. November is a big bull bar on the monthly chart. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices in December. Today might even close at a new all-time high. If it does, tomorrow could gap up, which would create a rare gap on the monthly chart.<p>But because September and October were bear bars on the monthly chart, the rally will probably end some time in December. Traders should expect the Emini to be sideways to down for the first half of 2021, as I discussed over the weekend.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 6 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably open within Friday’s range. With the past 2 days being sideways and with the Emini in a trading range for 3 weeks, there is an increased chance of another trading range day today.<p>Today is the final day of the month, but the bulls do not need a big bull day today. November is going to be a big bull bar on the monthly chart no matter what happens today. There is therefore less incentive for a big bull trend day.<p>But with November being a big bull bar, traders expect at least slightly higher prices in December. That reduces the incentive for the bears to create a strong bear day.<p>Most likely, today will have a lot of trading range trading again today, like most days in November. Remember, most closed either around the open or middle of the day’s range. That is therefore what is most likely again today. But if there is a series of strong bars in either direction, traders will conclude that the day is probably becoming a trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups – Early close</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-consecutive-wedge-bottoms-and-climactic-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-30.png\" alt=\"Emini consecutive wedge bottoms and climactic reversal up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-rally-to-double-top-with-September-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-30-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is testing the September 1 high at the top of a 4-month trading range. If the bulls get consecutive closes above that high, traders will look for the rally to test the next resistance, which is the February 2018 high above 1.25.<p>It is important to remember that most breakout attempts fail. The rally from the November 4 low has the best chance since August.<p>Even though the summer rally is resuming, traders should expect a disappointment. Yes, it probably will break above the September high, but will it continue up to the 2018 high? If it does, it will probably not do it in a straight line. It might test the November 11 low first.<p>If the rally from the November 11 low contained many big bull bars closing on their highs, traders would expect a quick move up to 1.25. But that is not the rally that we have at the moment. It is more likely that there will be a 2 to 3-week swing down from around the September high.<p>The rally from the November low is in a wedge bull channel. The 1st leg up in the channel began before the final low in the selloff from the September high to the November low. Also, the shape is not good. It will therefore not attract a lot of aggressive sellers. But if there is another pullback or two in December, the wedge could have a better shape. That couple lead to a pullback to the November 11 low.<p>One final point. There is a tendency for currencies to either breakout or reverse around the 1st of the year. Therefore, the EURUSD might wait until then before making its next big move up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market opened 1 pip below Friday’s high and rallied. But the rally has only been 30 pips. Most of the session has been within trading ranges.<p>The bulls would like the rally to continue up to the September 1 high, which is only 19 pips above the current session high. But the day’s small range is a sign of a lack of energy. Therefore today will probably not break strongly above that resistance.<p>At a minimum, the bulls want today to close above the open. There would then be consecutive bull bars on the daily chart closing above the top of the 3-month trading range that began with the September 9 high. Traders would then expect at least a small break above the September 1 high this week, which is a 2-year high.<p>The bears want the opposite. They want today to be a reversal day and close on its low. Today would then be a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a failed breakout above the September 10 high.<p>At the moment, day traders have only been buying. But they have not been buying aggressively. If the EURUSD continues to go sideways, day traders will begin to look to short as well, looking for a possible reversal day.<p>Since the EURUSD is just below major resistance, there is an increased chance of a big move up or down before the end of the session. If there is a big move, up is more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then reversed up in a bull channel. While it spent the middle of the day going sideways, the bulls got trend resumption up to a new high by the end of the day.<p>The day closed just above the open. This is the 3rd consecutive bull reversal in 3 days. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p>Today was the final day in November. The bar on the monthly chart was a big bull bar and it closed near its high. That makes at least slightly higher prices likely in December.<p>The all-time high is only 17 points above today’s close. There is a small chance that tomorrow would gap up to a new all-time high. There would then be a gap up to a new all-time high on the monthly chart. I suspect that has never happened in the history of the stock market.<p>Because tomorrow is the 1st day of the final month of the year and the bulls have been strong in November and since March, there is an increased chance that the bulls will try to continue the rally through year-end. That increases the chance of a bull trend day tomorrow. Furthermore, it increases the chance of a break to a new high this week and follow-through buying for the 1st half of the month.<p>Whenever something is more likely, the opposite is also more likely. That means traders should not be surprised if tomorrow is a bear trend day. With all of the reversals over the past month, traders will be open to anything. But there is an increased chance of a bullish bias for at least the 1st half of December.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders expect a new all-time high this week. In fact, today might even gap to a new all-time high. Since today is Monday, there would also be a gap on the weekly chart.<p>Can today reverse down from a double top with the November 9 high? It is more likely that the Emini will go up at least a little above that high. But if today is a big bear day, the double top will become more credible.<p>Today is the final day of the month. November is a big bull bar on the monthly chart. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices in December. Today might even close at a new all-time high. If it does, tomorrow could gap up, which would create a rare gap on the monthly chart.<p>But because September and October were bear bars on the monthly chart, the rally will probably end some time in December. Traders should expect the Emini to be sideways to down for the first half of 2021, as I discussed over the weekend.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 6 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably open within Friday’s range. With the past 2 days being sideways and with the Emini in a trading range for 3 weeks, there is an increased chance of another trading range day today.<p>Today is the final day of the month, but the bulls do not need a big bull day today. November is going to be a big bull bar on the monthly chart no matter what happens today. There is therefore less incentive for a big bull trend day.<p>But with November being a big bull bar, traders expect at least slightly higher prices in December. That reduces the incentive for the bears to create a strong bear day.<p>Most likely, today will have a lot of trading range trading again today, like most days in November. Remember, most closed either around the open or middle of the day’s range. That is therefore what is most likely again today. But if there is a series of strong bars in either direction, traders will conclude that the day is probably becoming a trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups – Early close</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-consecutive-wedge-bottoms-and-climactic-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-30.png\" alt=\"Emini consecutive wedge bottoms and climactic reversal up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-rally-to-double-top-with-September-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-30-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is testing the September 1 high at the top of a 4-month trading range. If the bulls get consecutive closes above that high, traders will look for the rally to test the next resistance, which is the February 2018 high above 1.25.<p>It is important to remember that most breakout attempts fail. The rally from the November 4 low has the best chance since August.<p>Even though the summer rally is resuming, traders should expect a disappointment. Yes, it probably will break above the September high, but will it continue up to the 2018 high? If it does, it will probably not do it in a straight line. It might test the November 11 low first.<p>If the rally from the November 11 low contained many big bull bars closing on their highs, traders would expect a quick move up to 1.25. But that is not the rally that we have at the moment. It is more likely that there will be a 2 to 3-week swing down from around the September high.<p>The rally from the November low is in a wedge bull channel. The 1st leg up in the channel began before the final low in the selloff from the September high to the November low. Also, the shape is not good. It will therefore not attract a lot of aggressive sellers. But if there is another pullback or two in December, the wedge could have a better shape. That couple lead to a pullback to the November 11 low.<p>One final point. There is a tendency for currencies to either breakout or reverse around the 1st of the year. Therefore, the EURUSD might wait until then before making its next big move up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market opened 1 pip below Friday’s high and rallied. But the rally has only been 30 pips. Most of the session has been within trading ranges.<p>The bulls would like the rally to continue up to the September 1 high, which is only 19 pips above the current session high. But the day’s small range is a sign of a lack of energy. Therefore today will probably not break strongly above that resistance.<p>At a minimum, the bulls want today to close above the open. There would then be consecutive bull bars on the daily chart closing above the top of the 3-month trading range that began with the September 9 high. Traders would then expect at least a small break above the September 1 high this week, which is a 2-year high.<p>The bears want the opposite. They want today to be a reversal day and close on its low. Today would then be a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a failed breakout above the September 10 high.<p>At the moment, day traders have only been buying. But they have not been buying aggressively. If the EURUSD continues to go sideways, day traders will begin to look to short as well, looking for a possible reversal day.<p>Since the EURUSD is just below major resistance, there is an increased chance of a big move up or down before the end of the session. If there is a big move, up is more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Emini-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-11-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then reversed up in a bull channel. While it spent the middle of the day going sideways, the bulls got trend resumption up to a new high by the end of the day.<p>The day closed just above the open. This is the 3rd consecutive bull reversal in 3 days. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p>Today was the final day in November. The bar on the monthly chart was a big bull bar and it closed near its high. That makes at least slightly higher prices likely in December.<p>The all-time high is only 17 points above today’s close. There is a small chance that tomorrow would gap up to a new all-time high. There would then be a gap up to a new all-time high on the monthly chart. I suspect that has never happened in the history of the stock market.<p>Because tomorrow is the 1st day of the final month of the year and the bulls have been strong in November and since March, there is an increased chance that the bulls will try to continue the rally through year-end. That increases the chance of a bull trend day tomorrow. Furthermore, it increases the chance of a break to a new high this week and follow-through buying for the 1st half of the month.<p>Whenever something is more likely, the opposite is also more likely. That means traders should not be surprised if tomorrow is a bear trend day. With all of the reversals over the past month, traders will be open to anything. But there is an increased chance of a bullish bias for at least the 1st half of December.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
