The Emini in September formed an outside down month with a big bear body. That makes some sideways to down trading likely.<p>But September had a big tail below on the monthly chart and it followed 5 strong bull bars. Therefore, the best the bears can probably get is a pullback lasting a month or two. The bulls will buy the pullback, betting against a trend reversal down.<p>The bar after an outside bar is often an inside bar. If October is an inside bar, it will be both a buy and sell signal bar for November. October will open today in the middle of September’s range. It is therefore beginning as an inside bar.<p>I have been saying that the small wedge bull flag on the daily chart should have a couple legs up. In addition, the rally should reach around the start of the wedge. That was the September 16 high, just above 3400. Despite yesterday’s reversal down, the Emini should still get there.<h3>Weak sell setup</h3><p>Yesterday was a 2nd small leg up on the daily chart and it broke above the February high. The Emini the collapsed 50 points late in the day to a new low of the day after the cash index went just 4 cents above its February high.<p>Despite yesterday’s reversal to a new low, yesterday’s candlestick had a small bull body on the daily chart. Additionally, the Emini bulls probably want another test of the February high and 3400. Therefore, if the daily chart reverses down today, the bulls should buy a 1 – 3-day pullback for at least one more attempt to break about 3400.<p>If the bulls get a breakout far above the September 16 high, the rally will probably continue up to a new high. It is still more likely that the rally will form a double top with the September 16 lower high and then break below the low of 2 weeks ago.<p>For several weeks, I have been saying that the Emini should fall below the July/August streak of 9 consecutive bull bars. The low of the streak was July 30 low of 3184.75. If it does, the odds of a test of 3000 will increase.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 29 points in the Globex session. The test of the cash index’s February high was so brief yesterday that many traders do not believe it was adequate. That increases the chance of another test today.<p>Also, the September 16 Emini lower high of 3419.50 is an important magnet above. These factors increase the chance of the Emini going at least a little higher within a few days.<p>Since those prices are important resistance, there is an increased chance of a sharp reversal down soon. Yesterday was an example. However, the odds favor an attempt to go at least a little higher today.<p>Every day this week had a lot of trading range trading, even though the legs up and down were often big. Day traders will expect at least one leg up and one leg down today. But because the Emini is testing resistance, they will be ready for a possible trend up or down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-1.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-pullback-in-bear-trend-or-reversal-up-into-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-1-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex pullback in bear trend or reversal up into bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied for 4 days after breaking below an 8-week trading range. If today closes far above the EMA or if today and tomorrow both close above the EMA and September 17 low, traders will conclude that the bear breakout failed. They would then think that the trading range is continuing or that the bull trend is resuming.<p>Because the September 2018 high is major resistance and this reversal up has not been strong, it probably is too early to bet on the April to August bull trend resuming. However, a couple closes above the EMA will make traders think the rally will test the September 21 sell climax high.<h3>Will October be an inside bar?</h3><p>The open of the week is so far below that the bulls should get a bull body on the weekly chart (not shown). If the week closes on its high, this week will be a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. But since the weekly chart is at major resistance, this would be a weak buy setup. It would make a continuation of the 2-month trading range more likely than a resumption of the bull trend.<p>September was an outside down bar on the monthly chart. The bar after an outside bar is often an inside bar. So far, October is above the September low and below the September high. It is therefore an inside bar. If it remains an inside bar all month, there will be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern on the monthly chart. That is a Breakout Mode pattern. October would then be both a buy signal bar and a sell signal bar for November.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a weak bull channel for 4 days. It is now testing resistance on the daily chart. There is a slightly increased chance of an acceleration up through that resistance today. But it is still more likely that the chart is working sideways to up. Day traders are therefore scalping in both directions. Because of the series of higher highs and lows, it is easier to make money buying pullbacks than selling rallies.<p>Today’s close is important. If the bulls can get the day to close near its high, the bulls will increase their chance of the rally continuing up next week to the September 21 high. But if the bears can get today to close on its low, today will be a sell signal bar for tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-day-at-February-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day at February high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini reversed down from above yesterday’s high. The Emini had a sell climax down to the EMA and a 50% retracement and then entered a trading range around the 50-day simple moving average. The bears got a test down to the 60-minute EMA, but the bulls bought it and the Emini returned to the earlier trading range.<p>Traders still expect a test of the 3400 Big Round Number and maybe the September 16 lower high. However, whether or not the Emini bulls get there, traders also know that the odds still favor a break below the September low before there is a new high. If the bulls get a strong break above that September lower high, the odds will shift in favor of a new high in October.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is trying to hold above the February high and the 50-day MA.<p>It is more likely that the Emini will turn down from this area than break strongly above it. However, there is still room to those targets above so the Emini will probably go at least a little higher.<p>Today is Friday and this week is the entry bar for a High 2 bull flag on the weekly chart. The bulls want the week to close on its high. This week would then be a strong entry bar and it would make at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>President Trump tested positive for Covid-19 today. No one knows if he will get sick or how the market will respond if he does. However, the technical factors are still in control. The market already believes that Biden will probably win. Therefore, if the President has to stop campaigning, that would probably not affect the market.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 52 points in the Globex session on the news of Trump testing positive for Covid-19. It sold off on the news but then has been sideways for 7 hours.<p>The location on the daily chart is good for the bears. I have been saying that the Emini would test to around the September 16 high and 3400 and then work its way down to below the September low.<p>The uncertainty has been over when the reversal down will begin. The news about the President could be the catalyst. If the bears get a couple consecutive big bear days, traders will conclude that a 2nd leg down has begun. If today is sideways to up, traders will look for a test closer to the September 16 high.<p>The market has had many big, abrupt reversals over the past couple days. That increases the chance of a big move in either direction. With the overnight news, there is less chance of a big bull trend day. If there is going to be a strong trend day, down is more likely, both because of the news and the pattern on the daily chart.<h3>Big gap down increases the chance of a trading range open</h3><p>The Emini will open with a big gap down. That increases the chance of a trading range open. While it is bearish, traders do not like to sell too far below the average price. The 20-bar EMA on the 5-minute chart is one measure of average. Most of the time, the Emini goes sideways after a big gap until it gets closer to the EMA. Since I use a 20-bar EMA, it can take about 20 bars to get there.<p>In a trading range open, the bulls look to buy either a wedge bottom or double bottom. The bears want to sell a wedge top or double top near the EMA. After a big gap down, there is only a 20% chance of a strong trend up or down that starts on the open.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-day-at-February-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day at February high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is already a wedge bear channel that began with the small bull bar on September 24. But if this rally is just a bear flag and a test of resistance at the EMA and September 17 low, there might be one more small bull day left in the next couple days.<p>If today or Monday is a big bull day that closes near its high and far above the September 17 low, traders will conclude that last week’s bear breakout failed. The EURUSD would be back its 2-month trading range. For traders to conclude that the July bull trend is resuming, they will need a strong break above the September 1 high.<p>For 2 months, the bars have been small, the legs up and down have lasted only a week or so, and many bars have had prominent tails. This is trading range price action, which reduces the chance of a big breakout in either direction. Traders continue to look for reversals. They exit in a few days and then look for another another trade in either direction.<p>This week is a bull bar on the weekly chart. The bulls want the week to close near the high of the week, which is yesterday’s high. If it does, that will increase the chance that last week’s bear breakout failed, and it would increase the chance of higher prices next week. If this week has a big tail on top, which it currently has (not shown), traders will look for more sideways trading next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low, but reversed up. Yesterday was a Low 1 sell signal bar on the daily chart, but it had a bull body. Traders expected that there would be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>The reversal up was not particularly strong and the EURUSD has been in a 40-pip tall trading range for most of the session. The trading range is currently a triangle. Day traders are buying reversals up from the low and selling reversals down from the high, and they are scalping.<p>The 2 bull overnight legs were stronger than the bear legs.

It is trying to hold above the February high and the 50-day MA.<p>It is more likely that the Emini will turn down from this area than break strongly above it. However, there is still room to those targets above so the Emini will probably go at least a little higher.<p>Today is Friday and this week is the entry bar for a High 2 bull flag on the weekly chart. The bulls want the week to close on its high. This week would then be a strong entry bar and it would make at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>President Trump tested positive for Covid-19 today. No one knows if he will get sick or how the market will respond if he does. However, the technical factors are still in control. The market already believes that Biden will probably win. Therefore, if the President has to stop campaigning, that would probably not affect the market.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 52 points in the Globex session on the news of Trump testing positive for Covid-19. It sold off on the news but then has been sideways for 7 hours.<p>The location on the daily chart is good for the bears. I have been saying that the Emini would test to around the September 16 high and 3400 and then work its way down to below the September low.<p>The uncertainty has been over when the reversal down will begin. The news about the President could be the catalyst. If the bears get a couple consecutive big bear days, traders will conclude that a 2nd leg down has begun. If today is sideways to up, traders will look for a test closer to the September 16 high.<p>The market has had many big, abrupt reversals over the past couple days. That increases the chance of a big move in either direction. With the overnight news, there is less chance of a big bull trend day. If there is going to be a strong trend day, down is more likely, both because of the news and the pattern on the daily chart.<h3>Big gap down increases the chance of a trading range open</h3><p>The Emini will open with a big gap down. That increases the chance of a trading range open. While it is bearish, traders do not like to sell too far below the average price. The 20-bar EMA on the 5-minute chart is one measure of average. Most of the time, the Emini goes sideways after a big gap until it gets closer to the EMA. Since I use a 20-bar EMA, it can take about 20 bars to get there.<p>In a trading range open, the bulls look to buy either a wedge bottom or double bottom. The bears want to sell a wedge top or double top near the EMA. After a big gap down, there is only a 20% chance of a strong trend up or down that starts on the open.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-day-at-February-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day at February high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is already a wedge bear channel that began with the small bull bar on September 24. But if this rally is just a bear flag and a test of resistance at the EMA and September 17 low, there might be one more small bull day left in the next couple days.<p>If today or Monday is a big bull day that closes near its high and far above the September 17 low, traders will conclude that last week’s bear breakout failed. The EURUSD would be back its 2-month trading range. For traders to conclude that the July bull trend is resuming, they will need a strong break above the September 1 high.<p>For 2 months, the bars have been small, the legs up and down have lasted only a week or so, and many bars have had prominent tails. This is trading range price action, which reduces the chance of a big breakout in either direction. Traders continue to look for reversals. They exit in a few days and then look for another another trade in either direction.<p>This week is a bull bar on the weekly chart. The bulls want the week to close near the high of the week, which is yesterday’s high. If it does, that will increase the chance that last week’s bear breakout failed, and it would increase the chance of higher prices next week. If this week has a big tail on top, which it currently has (not shown), traders will look for more sideways trading next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low, but reversed up. Yesterday was a Low 1 sell signal bar on the daily chart, but it had a bull body. Traders expected that there would be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>The reversal up was not particularly strong and the EURUSD has been in a 40-pip tall trading range for most of the session. The trading range is currently a triangle. Day traders are buying reversals up from the low and selling reversals down from the high, and they are scalping.<p>The 2 bull overnight legs were stronger than the bear legs. That reduces the chance of a bear trend day.<p>The fight today will be over the close. The bears want today to close near its low and below yesterday’s low. That will increase the chance of lower prices next week. The bulls want the day and week to close near its high. That will increase the chance of higher prices next week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-gap-down-and-then-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini gap down and then bull trend from the open and trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

from a small wedge bottom 7 days ago. However, September was an outside down bar on the monthly chart. That increases the chance of sideways to down trading in October. Traders believe that the Emini might go a little higher to the September 16 lower high next week, but that it will then turn down from a double top bear flag.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>have been in a tight trading range for 7 months. There is no sign that this is about to change.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex weekly chart reversed back up this week after last week’s strong bear breakout. However, it is still on a wedge top sell signal, and traders expect it to continue sideways to down for at least a few more weeks, even if it bounces for a week or two.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-monthly-chart-is-in-7-month-tight-trading-range\">Bond futures<em><strong>monthly</strong></em><strong>chart</strong>is in 7-month tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-3.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart in tight trading range after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The monthly bond futures chart formed an inside bar in September. Its high was below the August high and its low was above the August low. Since August was an outside bar, there is now an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern. This is Breakout Mode. September is both a buy and sell signal bar.<p>The bulls see the 7-month tight trading range as a bull flag. They want October to resume the bull trend.<p>For the bears, the March reversal down was from the biggest buy climax in history. They see the 7 months since as a pause in the reversal down. They want the reversal to continue to the January 2020 buy climax low.<p>What is more likely? Since March, I said that the buy climax was so extreme that the bulls might not buy for 10 or more bars — about a year. I also said that the bull trend was so strong that the bears probably could not get a strong reversal down until they first stop the bulls for about 10 bars.<p>With neither the bulls nor the bears willing to be aggressive for a long time, I have been saying that the bond market was likely to stay sideways for about a year. There is no sign that this price action is about to end.<h2 id=\"3-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"4-eurusd-monthly-chart-had-an-outside-down-september-at-resistance\">EURUSD<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart had an outside down September at resistance</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-ioi-and-double-top-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-3-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart in ioi and double top after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex monthly chart formed an outside down bar in September. There is also a double top with the September 2018 high. But this follows 4 strong bull bars. Therefore, bulls will buy a 1 to 2-month pullback.<p>Since the monthly chart has been in a trading range for 5 years, traders expect a pullback after a breakout. Therefore, the EURUSD will probably test down to the March 2020 high. That was the breakout point, and a pullback from a rally in trading ranges typically falls to at least a little below breakout point.<p>Does there have to be a pullback? No, but the selloff from the February 2018 high was a Spike and Channel bear trend. The bear channel began with the September 2018 high.<p>Once there is a break above the bear channel and a test of the start of the channel, the rally usually stalls. The market then typically enters a trading range. The bulls want a strong breakout above the prior high, and the bears want a reversal down from a double top with that high.<p>The market usually needs to see many bars before deciding on the direction of the next move. Consequently, the monthly chart will probably not race up or down.<h3 id=\"5-september-was-an-outside-down-bar-at-resistance\">September was an outside down bar at resistance</h3><p>September was an outside down bar in a strong bull leg. That is not a strong sell setup. There are usually buyers around the low of the bar. If October falls below the September low, October will probably not form a big bear bar closing near its low. More likely, October would close back up at around the September low.<p>So far, October is within September’s range. An inside bar often follows an outside bar. That inside bar is a buy signal bar in a bull trend. It is also a sell signal bar for a double top with the September 2018 high. With both credible buy and sell setups, an ioi pattern (inside-outside-inside) is a Breakout Mode situation.<p>The March high is an important magnet below. Also, a rally after a Spike and Channel bear trend usually tests the start of the bear channel and then transitions into a trading range. Consequently, the EURUSD will probably be sideways to down for a month or two. But the bulls will buy the selloff.<h2 id=\"6-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-reversing-up-from-last-weeks-bear-breakout\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart is reversing up from last week’s bear breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-bad-follow-through-after-trend-reversal-down-from-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-3-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has bad follow through after trend reversal down from wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart had a bull inside bar this week. This is terrible follow-through for the bears after their big bear bar of the week before. It lowers the chances of a bear trend reversal after the wedge top.<p>However, traders still should expect at least a small 2nd leg down after a 4-month wedge top at resistance. Also, the breakout points of the March 9 and June 10 highs are magnets below. Therefore, while this week closed near its high and the bear breakout is failing, there will probably be sellers not too far above this week’s high.<p>What can the bulls do? If they get a break above this week’s high, they will trigger a weekly buy signal. However, that is not enough to convince traders that the bull trend is resuming. They need 2 or 3 consecutive bull bars closing near their highs or a strong break above the September high.<p>They have a 40% chance of success. There is a 60% chance that either the 2-month trading range continues for another month, or of a 1 to 2-week bounce to a lower high and then a 2nd leg down to the targets below.<h2 id=\"7-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"8-president-trump-tested-positive-for-covid-19\">President Trump tested positive for Covid-19</h2><p>Early on Friday, the White House announced that President Trump tested positive for Covid-19 and he is now having early symptoms. There is no way that this news helps the market. The question is whether it is a catalyst for a 2nd leg down from the September high. We will find out over the next few days.<p>Most people do not get symptoms for several days after getting infected. He might have contracted the virus on Saturday at an event for his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Barrett. At least 3 others from the event subsequently tested positive. These are Trump’s wife, the president of Notre Dame, and Senator Mike Lee, who at one point shook hands with Trump and neither were wearing masks.<p>Finally, 2 of Trump’s closest White House advisors, Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway, and his campaign manager, Bill Stepien, also tested positive this week.<p>It is interesting that Judge Barrett herself had Covid-19 this summer, but has since tested negative. She therefore was probably not the source of Trump’s infection. She presumably still has antibodies to the virus and therefore will probably not get sick from the event.<p>He probably was infected while on stage with Biden in the debate, and there is one report that he might have had early symptoms at that time. He gets tested every day, but it takes several days after exposure to have enough virus particles to cause a positive test. I want to believe that he tested negative on the day of the debate and not knowingly risked infecting others. Biden so far has tested negative.<h3 id=\"9-trump-will-get-the-worlds-best-treatment\">Trump will get the world’s best treatment</h3><p>If Trump is going to get very sick, we will know by early next week. It might take well into next week to know if this will interfere with his campaign and his re-election bid.<p>He is getting a high dose of Regeneron’s experimental drug, REGN-COV2. This is a monoclonal antibody cocktail containing antibodies from patients who recovered from Covid-19 and from mice that were given the viral spike protein. This drug is still in its clinical trials and it is unavailable to you and me. However, most agree that it is reasonable to let the president skip to the front of the line.<p>The early data from 275 of the 2,100 patients in the ongoing trial make the drug sound beneficial. The patients tended to have less severe symptoms and fewer virus particles, and they needed fewer office visits. Therefore, his risk of a severe infection is likely less than that for the average person.<p>But he is 74 years old and obese. That is never good with Covid-19. Also, he might have other medical problems, but we do not know since he hides his medical record.<h3 id=\"10-the-president-is-just-not-that-important-when-it-comes-to-the-stock-market\">The president is just not that important when it comes to the stock market</h3><p>The market already knows that Biden is likely to win. That has been priced in. If the President gets very sick, his lack of campaigning will increase Biden’s chances. That might be somewhat bearish for the market. I say “somewhat” because the market rallied much more strongly under Clinton and Obama than under Bush or Trump.<p>The president is just not that significant when it comes to the market. The market is much bigger than just one person. However, Fed Chair Powell is critical. He has promised to “print infinite money” to prevent a big selloff. No president can do that, and that is much more important than anything any president can say or do.<h3 id=\"11-the-market-is-reacting-to-technical-factors-more-than-to-the-presidential-election\">The market is reacting to technical factors more than to the presidential election</h3><p>Traders must understand that there are technical factors that are more important than this news. For over a month, I have been saying that the Emini will probably fall below the July 30 low. That was the bottom of a streak of 9 consecutive bull days. When there is an extreme buy climax like that, traders expect a reversal down to below its low.<p>Also, if the Emini gets there, it will have to break below the September 24 low. That is the neckline of the double top created by the September 16 high and this week’s high. A measured move down is around the 3000 Big Round Number, the June trading range low, and a 20% correction.<p>The market already has a bearish technical picture for the next month, but it has been waiting for an excuse to go down to the targets below. A sick president could be that excuse.<p>I keep reminding traders that the market always has a 40% chance of doing exactly the opposite of what you might believe. Therefore, if it rallies strongly next week to above the September 16 high, traders will buy, regardless of the news out of Washington. Price is truth.<h2 id=\"12-monthly-emini-chart-had-outside-down-bar-in-september\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart had outside down bar in September</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-ioi-after-expanding-triangle-top-and-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-3-3.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a big bear outside down bar in September. The September high was above the August high and its low was below the August low.<p>While it had a big bear body, the close was far above the August low. It is therefore not nearly as bearish as it could have been. Moreover, it followed 5 strong bull bars. This is bad context for traders looking for a bear trend reversal.<p>The 5 big bull bars reversed up from a dramatic sell climax in March. When there is a big reversal after a big selloff, traders expect at least a small 2nd leg up. Consequently, they are planning to buy the 1st reversal down. That pullback is often called the handle in a cup and handle bottom. The selloff and reversal up formed the cup.<h3 id=\"13-what-happens-after-an-outside-down-bar\">What happens after an outside down bar?</h3><p>When there is an outside down bar in a bull trend, traders expect the market to go sideways to down. So far October is within the September range. It is therefore an inside bar after an outside bar.<p>If October remains an inside bar, there will be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern on the monthly chart. That is a Breakout Mode situation. October would be both a buy and a sell signal bar.<p>For the Bulls, October would be a High 1 bull flag in a bull trend. The bears, however, see it as a pause after September’s reversal down. It would be both a Low 1 sell signal bar and an ioi top sell signal bar.<p>Breakout Mode patterns are often 50-50. In this particular case, if October remains an inside bar, the ioi would be coming in a buy climax at resistance. There would make the probability of a bear breakout slightly higher.<h3 id=\"14-what-happens-above-or-below-september\">What happens above or below September?</h3><p>If October goes above the September high, it will probably not get far. There will probably be sellers above a bear bar in a buy climax at resistance.<p>But what if October falls below the September low? That would trigger a minor monthly sell signal. Traders would expect at least slightly lower prices for a month or two.<p>If October was a big bear bar closing on its low and far below the September low, traders would expect at least a 50% selloff. That type of bar is unlikely, given how strong the bull trend is and how weak the outside down bar is.<p>Most likely, October will either remain an inside bar or it will go below the September low. If it goes below the September low, it will probably not close far below the September low. That would be bearish and therefore that is unlikely.<p>Instead it would probably close around the September low. If it closed a little below, traders would expect maybe slightly lower prices in November. But if it were to close above the September low, traders will expect more sideways trading in November. This is especially true if October closed far above the September low.<h3 id=\"15-minor-trend-reversal-likely\">Minor trend reversal likely</h3><p>If October goes below the September low, it will trigger a minor sell signal. There is a buy climax at the top of a 3-year trading range and at the top of a 16-year bull channel. The reason why I am calling this a minor reversal is that the bulls will buy the selloff. Therefore instead of a major trend reversal into a bear trend, the selloff should be a bull flag.<p>How far down can the reversal go? Every trader’s first reaction is 50%. In strong bull trends with weak tops, they look for less. With strong tops, they look for more. The Emini has stopped going up in September, but it has not yet begun to go down on the monthly chart. The 50% retracement level is 2926.50. There are other targets on the weekly and daily charts and I will discuss them below.<h2 id=\"16-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-a-weak-high-2-buy-signal\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a weak High 2 buy signal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-ihas-weak-entry-bar-after-weak-High-2-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-3-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has weak entry bar after weak High 2 bull flag buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart triggered a High 2 bull flag buy signal this week by going above last week’s high. The buy signal was not strong. Last week was a small bull bar that followed 3 bear bars and a buy climax. This buy signal will probably lead to a bounce and not a resumption of the bull trend. The sellers should return within a couple weeks.<p>What happens if next week is a 3rd consecutive bull bar? Then traders will expect more sideways to up trading during the following week.<p>What if next week is a big bull bar closing on its high and far above the minor lower high from 2 weeks ago? Then traders will expect a test of the September all-time high.<h2 id=\"17-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-market-has-rally-and-possible-double-top-with-september-16-high\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures market has rally and possible double top with September 16 high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-testing-February-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-3-5.png\" alt=\"Emini testing February high\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been sideways around the February high for 2 months. Remember, it collapsed from that price in February. Also, although August broke far above that high, the breakout failed. Traders are taking a long time deciding if it is unenterable resistance. If so, the Emini will sell off and then the bulls would try again in a month or two.<p>The Emini formed a small wedge bottom on September 24. At that time, I said that it should reverse up and test the start of the wedge selloff, which was the September 16 high.<p>The Emini is around that price now. Traders will decide over the next few days if the Emini will break strongly above that lower high and continue up to test the all-time high. The bulls currently have a 40% chance.<p>The bears should sell some time next week. For them, the rally from the September 21 low is a wedge bear flag and it is forming a double top with the September 16 high. They want a reversal down to below the September 24 neckline of the double top and a measured move down.<p>That would be around the June trading range, which is a possible Final Bull Flag and a magnet. It is also around the other magnets of the 3000 Big Round Number, a 20% correction, and a 50% retracement of the 5-month rally.<h3 id=\"18-the-correction-probably-has-more-to-go\">The correction probably has more to go</h3><p>What are the odds of a break below the September low before there is a new high? It this particular case, the probability is currently 60%.<p>Why so high? Because there was a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that started in late July. A streak like that is rare and therefore climactic. When there is a reversal down from an extreme buy climax, the selloff usually continues to at least a little below the start of the buy climax.<p>That is the July 30 low of 3184.75, which is below the September low of 3198.00. If it gets there, traders will look for a measured move down from the September trading range to the targets around 3000.<h3 id=\"19-trading-range-price-action-will-change-soon\">Trading range price action will change soon</h3><p>It is important to understand the price action over the past month. All through September in my trading room, I said that the selloff looks like a leg in a trading range and not the start of a bear trend. That is why I kept saying that it should bounce back to above 3400.<p>After the 1st 2 big bear days in early September, the bars were mostly small with prominent tails. Furthermore, there were reversals every few days and there were several bull days. That is a market that lacks conviction.<p>While the trading range from 3200 to 3400 could continue for another month or more, it probably will not. It will end with a breakout up or down. Down is more likely. The breakout will have 2 or more consecutive big bear bars or 3 or 4 consecutive smaller bear bars. Both represent a consensus that the market is headed lower. That is trending price action.<h2 id=\"20-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders are deciding between a new high and a test of 3000. I talked about the<a aria-label=\"President's Covid infection (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-futures-wedge-rally-double-top/#8-president-trump-tested-positive-for-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\">President’s Covid infection</a>over the weekend. I believe that technical factors are more important.<p>The bears want a reversal down from a double top with the September 16 lower high. The bulls hope that last week’s small wedge bottom will lead to a new high.<p>I keep talking about that streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that started in late July. While traders can argue that the market is neutral, that streak is important. When there is a reversal down after a bull streak, the market typically falls below the streak. Therefore, the odds still favor a test below the July 29 bottom of that streak. And that means a break below the September 24 wedge bottom.<p>The biggest problem that the bears have is that the Emini has not quite reached the September 16 lower high. Traders expect the Emini to get there. Therefore, the Emini will probably go at least a little above 3400 before the bears can get a 2nd leg down from the September high.<p>The bulls currently have a 40% chance that this rally will make a new high. Their odds will go up if the Emini breaks strongly above the September 16 lower high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 21 points in the Globex session. It has been sideways for 4 days after a strong reversal up from a wedge bottom on September 24. Traders are deciding if the rally will continue up to the September 16 lower high.<p>Because the overnight range has been small and the Emini has been sideways for 5 days, day traders will expect more trading range price action again today. That means at least one leg up and one leg down.<p>But since the Emini is in Breakout Mode on the daily chart, there can be a surprisingly strong trend day in either direction at any time. At the moment, it is likely that there will be a test above 3400 this week. But, it is also likely that there will be a reversal down from the top of the month-long trading range some time in October.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-gap-down-and-then-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-5.png\" alt=\"Emini gap down and then bull trend from the open and trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Traders are deciding if the breakout has failed and the bull trend is resuming.<p>The bears hope that this rally will be a wedge bear flag to the EMA or the September 21 sell climax high. Most likely, the bear breakout simply increased the height of the trading range and the EURUSD will go sideways more before successfully breaking out.<p>Trading ranges resist breaking out. Reversals are more common. There have been many reversals in the past 9 weeks and no successful breakouts. There is currently no reason to believe that the late September selloff or the 2-week reversal up will be different.<p>At some point, there will be a breakout up or down. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will continue to look for reversals and take profits every few days.<p>Since today is the 3rd small leg up from the September 25 low, there is an increased chance of a change this week. Either a bear leg will begin or the bulls will get a breakout above the wedge bear flag and the rally will continue up to the top of the trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a bull trend overnight. However, today’s high is a fraction of a pip below last week’s high. I wrote about<a aria-label=\"the weekly chart (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-futures-wedge-rally-double-top/#6-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-reversing-up-from-last-weeks-bear-breakout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">the weekly chart</a>over the weekend. Last week is a buy signal bar for this week. It is a weak setup, but today’s rally is close to triggering that signal. Since it us a weak setup, there is probably not much left to today’s rally.<p>Because the overnight bull trend has been strong, day traders have only been buying. They are hoping for a big breakout above last week’s high. Since that is unlikely, the rally will probably evolve into a trading range around last week’s high. Once there is a 20 – 30 pip pullback, day traders will also begin to sell for scalps.<p>Can today reverse back down? Probably not, at least not until the bull trend evolves into a trading range for an hour or two.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-5-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls got trend resumption up to 3400 later in the day, but could not get the close above that Big Round Number. The rally should continue up to test the September 16 lower high. But, I continue to say that the next 200 points will probably be down to 3000 instead of up to 3600.<p>Many traders do not want to short until they believe that the top of the month-long trading range has been adequately tested. They would like to see the rally reach at least to around the September 16 high.<p>If the Emini breaks strongly above that high, the odds will shift in favor of a new high. But if there is a reversal down from there, traders will conclude that a 2nd leg down from the all-time high might be beginning.<p>The Emini is at the top of a 5-day tight trading range, but there is room to the top of the 2 month trading range. It will probably go a little higher before reversing down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders are deciding if the breakout has failed and the bull trend is resuming.<p>The bears hope that this rally will be a wedge bear flag to the EMA or the September 21 sell climax high. Most likely, the bear breakout simply increased the height of the trading range and the EURUSD will go sideways more before successfully breaking out.<p>Trading ranges resist breaking out. Reversals are more common. There have been many reversals in the past 9 weeks and no successful breakouts. There is currently no reason to believe that the late September selloff or the 2-week reversal up will be different.<p>At some point, there will be a breakout up or down. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will continue to look for reversals and take profits every few days.<p>Since today is the 3rd small leg up from the September 25 low, there is an increased chance of a change this week. Either a bear leg will begin or the bulls will get a breakout above the wedge bear flag and the rally will continue up to the top of the trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a bull trend overnight. However, today’s high is a fraction of a pip below last week’s high. I wrote about<a aria-label=\"the weekly chart (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-futures-wedge-rally-double-top/#6-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-reversing-up-from-last-weeks-bear-breakout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">the weekly chart</a>over the weekend. Last week is a buy signal bar for this week. It is a weak setup, but today’s rally is close to triggering that signal. Since it us a weak setup, there is probably not much left to today’s rally.<p>Because the overnight bull trend has been strong, day traders have only been buying. They are hoping for a big breakout above last week’s high. Since that is unlikely, the rally will probably evolve into a trading range around last week’s high. Once there is a 20 – 30 pip pullback, day traders will also begin to sell for scalps.<p>Can today reverse back down? Probably not, at least not until the bull trend evolves into a trading range for an hour or two.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-5-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls got trend resumption up to 3400 later in the day, but could not get the close above that Big Round Number. The rally should continue up to test the September 16 lower high. But, I continue to say that the next 200 points will probably be down to 3000 instead of up to 3600.<p>Many traders do not want to short until they believe that the top of the month-long trading range has been adequately tested. They would like to see the rally reach at least to around the September 16 high.<p>If the Emini breaks strongly above that high, the odds will shift in favor of a new high. But if there is a reversal down from there, traders will conclude that a 2nd leg down from the all-time high might be beginning.<p>The Emini is at the top of a 5-day tight trading range, but there is room to the top of the 2 month trading range. It will probably go a little higher before reversing down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

While traders expect the 2-week wedge rally to test the September 16 lower high this week, they also expect a reversal down from between 3400 and 3500. The reversal can come at any time, but the bears want a good sell signal bar on the daily chart. It is possible that the September trading range continues up to the US presidential election before there is a breakout up or down.<p>The bulls obviously want a successful breakout above the 5-week trading range and a measured move up to a new high. They have a 40% chance of achieving their goal. A strong breakout above the September 16 lower high would shift the probability in favor of a new all-time high.<p>Most recent days have had a lot of trading range price action. That is what typically happens when the market is in a trading range on the daily chart, like over the past 5 weeks. Day traders will expect more of it today, despite yesterday’s rally. However, the September 16 lower high is a magnet above, so traders expect at least slightly higher prices.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex session. Since traders expect a test of the September 16 high of 3419.50 and the Emini has been rallying for 3 weeks, there is a bullish bias to the market this week.<p>That high is only 13 points above today’s current Globex high. The Emini could easily get there today.<p>On the 60 minute chart, there is another lower high at 3474. That is why I have been saying that the sell zone might be up to 3500. However, there were several lower highs below that and the Emini will probably begin to go sideways in this resistance zone. That will increase the chance of more trading range trading on the 5 minute chart.<p>Since there is a magnet at 3474 and the Emini has been rallying, there is an increased chance of a big bull trend day this week. Traders might conclude that the Emini is going to test 3474 – 3500. If enough do, the Emini could rally strongly for a couple days and get there. However, it is more likely that the Emini will start to go sideways today or tomorrow.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The 2-week rally has had 3 small legs up. It is therefore a wedge bear flag.<p>But the September 21 sell climax high is a magnet above, as is the September 2018 high. Consequently, the EURUSD should continue a little higher before the bears will try to resume their bear trend. If there is a sell signal bar this week, traders will look for a resumption of the test down to the June 10 high, which was the breakout point of the strong July rally.<p>The EURUSD is back in its 2-month trading range. That means that the bulls and bears are nearly balanced. At the moment, the probability slightly favors the bears. But the bulls see this 2-week rally as the early stage of a Small Pullback Bull Trend. They are hoping that the 2 legs down from the September 1 high is the end of the pullback from the 4-month buy climax.<p>But to convince traders that the July bull trend has resumed, the bulls need at least a couple closes above the September 10 high. Most traders want to see a strong break above the September 1 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways overnight. It is at a new high, but it might be forming an expanding triangle. That could limit the upside from here today.<p>The EURUSD overnight broke slightly above yesterday’s high and the 1.18 Big Round Number. However, the developing expanding triangle means that there has been a lot of trading range price action. The rally over the past few hours will probably evolve back to a trading range within the next hour or two.<p>The bulls hope that today continues up in a bull trend, but at the moment, the rally from the low is probably going to soon go sideways again. The day will then be both an expanding triangle and a trending trading range day.<p>Since many days over the past 2 month went above and below the September 2018 high of 1.1816, the EURUSUD will probably test above it this week. It might get there today since it is only 8 pips above today’s current high.<p>Because of that magnet and the magnet of the September 21 high of 1.1872, traders have been buying pullbacks for 2 weeks. It therefore has been easier to make money as a bull day trader.<p>But the EURUSD is getting near important resistance. The bulls will become less willing to buy and the bears will be more eager to sell reversals down. This increases the chance of a few sideways days between 1.18 and 1.1872.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-wedge-bull-flag-and-then-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bull flag and then bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The news was the excuse for the market to do what I have been saying it would do for a month. It just happened more quickly than was likely.<p>Today was an outside bar on the daily chart.

Yesterday briefly broke above that high and then collapsed.<p>There is a wedge rally over the past 2 weeks to a double top with the September 16 high on the daily chart. That is a common sell setup. Yesterday was an outside down bar and therefore a sell signal bar. Not only was yesterday outside down, it closed below Monday’s low. That increases the chance the resistance of the September 16 high will hold.<p>The bulls might try for another test of the September 16 high before the bears get their 2nd leg down from the September 3 all-time high, but traders will look to sell rallies.<h3>Trends need follow-through</h3><p>It is a mistake to assume that one day makes a trend. The Emini has been in a trading range for over a month and it might continue sideways until the US election. For example, if it drifts down 300 and then bounces, the bulls will see a head and shoulders bull flag on the daily chart. They will buy, hoping to break above the neck line, which is yesterday’s high.<p>Today is important. Trends panic traders. If today is a big bear day, then the bear trend from the September 3 high is likely resuming. But if today is a bull day, the bears will be disappointed. Disappointment is a hallmark of a trading range. That would increase the chance that the trading range will continue, maybe for a few more weeks.<p>That July/August streak of 9 consecutive bull bars was an important buy climax. Traders should expect the pullback to fall to at least a little below that July 26 bottom of the streak, which means below the September low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 27 points in the Globex session. The day after an outside day is often an inside day. If the bulls can keep today inside of yesterday’s range, today will be a buy signal bar for tomorrow. They will then try again to break above the September 16 lower high within a few days.<p>The bears want a 2nd consecutive big bear day. But since the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 months, the bears will probably be disappointed by a lack of strong follow-through selling today.<p>Most bear trend days make a high early in the day. The bears therefore will try to get a reversal down in the 1st couple hours. If they are unable, today would then probably be either a trading range day or a bull trend day.<p>Can today be a big bull trend day. That is unlikely after such a strong bear surprise. However, it could be a weak bull trend day and get back above last week’s high. That would undo a lot of yesterday’s bearishness and increase the chance that the 2-month trading range will continue.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-wedge-bull-flag-and-then-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-7.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bull flag and then bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday was a good sell signal bar. By going below yesterday’s low overnight, the sell signal on the daily chart triggered.<p>However, the EURUSD immediately reversed back up. Today so far is a bull bar and therefore a terrible entry bar for the bears.<p>The 2 week rally has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. The September 21 sell climax high is a magnet above. If the bulls can break above it and above the September 10 high, traders will look for a test of the September 1 high.<p>The EURUSD is back in its 2 month trading range. That means there is also always both a bull trend and a bear trend. If it continues down in a series of lower highs and lows, traders will say the bear trend began on September 1. If the 2 week rally continues up to above the September 1 high, traders will say that the 4 month bull trend resumed on September 25.<p>Because of the wedge top at resistance on the weekly chart (not shown), the odds are slightly better for the bears. But the EURUSD is back in its 2 month trading range. Consequently, the odds are only slightly better than 50%.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low overnight, which triggered a sell signal on the daily chart. However, the breakout was small and the EURUSD reversed back up. The bulls want today to break above yesterday’s high. Today would then be an outside up bar after yesterday’s sell signal bar. That would increase the chance of a test of the September 21 sell climax high.<p>If today closes near its high, traders will see today as a buy signal bar. They would wonder if the wedge bear flag on the daily chart failed and if the Small Pullback Bull Trend is continuing up.<p>The reversal up from below yesterday’s sell signal bar makes a bear trend unlikely today. While the EURUSUD has been in a bull trend for 8 hours, the trend has not been particularly strong.<p>It has been easier to make money as a bull, but there has been a lot of trading range price action for 5 hours. That means that day traders are also willing to sell reversals down for scalps.<p>With the lack of energy for several hours, today will probably not go much higher. The rally will probably stall around yesterday’s high.<p>The fight will then be over the close. The bulls will buy selloffs, trying to get today to close near its high. That would make higher prices likely tomorrow.<p>The bears will sell rallies. They know today will remain a bull day, but if they can get the day to close in the middle of the range, they will try to break again below yesterday’s low tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-7-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is not how a bear trend typically begins. It then rallied for the rest of the day and retraced most of yesterday’s selloff. There was late profit-taking, but the day still closed above its midpoint. Today was a bull trending trading range day.<p>Today was a bull inside day after an outside day on the daily chart. There is now an ioi Breakout Mode pattern. Today is both a buy and sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>With today erasing so much of yesterday’s collapse and closing in the upper half of the range, and with the September 16 high still a magnet above, the Emini will probably test that high again this week. Also, today increased the chance that the Emini will trade higher up in the 3400 – 3500 sell zone.<p>Traders still should expect a break below the September low before there is a new high. However, the trading range could continue for a long time before the Emini has a 2nd leg down from the all-time high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There is now an IOI (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode setup. Yesterday is now both a buy and sell signal bar.<p>Today will probably gap up and trigger the buy signal. Furthermore, the Emini is currently trading above the September 16 high, which is the top of the month-long trading range.<p>In general, a breakout has a 50% chance of failing. However, this is important resistance. The overnight breakout will probably lead to at least a couple days of sideways to up trading before traders decide if the breakout will fail.<p>The bulls want the 2 week rally to continue up to a new high this month. If they get consecutive closes above the September 16 lower high, the Emini will probably continue up to the September 3 all-time high. At that point, the bulls will want a strong breakout to a new high. But the bears will try to create a reversal down from a double top.<p>At the moment, the odds still are favor a lower high and a 2nd leg sideways to down on the daily chart. But that could chance in the next few days.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. If it opens here, it will gap above the September 10 high. That is the top of a month-long trading range.<p>The bears want the breakout to fail and for the Emini to reverse down strongly on the open. But I have been saying that the rally might continue up to 3500 before the bears will sell aggressively again.<p>Since the bears were unable to get follow-through selling after their big bear day on Tuesday, the odds are that the Emini will get some follow-through buying over the next few days.<p>If there is a trend today, up is slightly more likely. Because the Emini is at major resistance, there is an increased chance of a big breakout above that resistance. That means the bulls have an increased chance of a big bull trend.<p>Trend days usually being in the 1st hour or two. There is a 20% chance of a strong trend up or down that begins within the first few bars. Otherwise, traders will look for early sideways trading. The bulls will try to reverse up from a wedge bottom or double bottom near the EMA. However, the bears will look for a wedge rally or a double top and then a bear trend.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-8.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bears see the 2-week rally as a wedge bear flag at the EMA and the September 2018 high.<p>They triggered the sell signal yesterday, but yesterday was a bull day. The bears will try to get a 2nd reversal down within the next few days.<p>They need a couple bear days to convince traders that the month-long bear trend is intact. Their minimum goal is a test below the June 10 high, which was the breakout point of the July rally. They also want a measured move down from the 2-month trading range.<p>The rally from the September low is a Small Pullback Bull Trend. The bulls want it to break strongly above Tuesday’s high, which is the top of the wedge bear flag. They then want a break above the September 10 lower high.<p>Finally, the want a couple closes above the September 1 high. If they achieve those goals, traders will look for the rally to continue up to 1.25 at the February 2018 high.<p>Even though the EURUSD is still in a 3-month trading range after a 4-month rally, the weekly chart (not shown) has a wedge rally to resistance. Consequently, the odds are still in favor of a test down to the June 10 high before there is a break above the September high. However, a few consecutive bull days will reverse those odds.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a tight trading range for 7 days. This continued overnight. Day traders will continue to look for reversals and small profits.

There is now an IOI (inside-outside-inside) pattern, which is a Breakout Mode setup. Yesterday is now both a buy and sell signal bar.<p>Today will probably gap up and trigger the buy signal. Furthermore, the Emini is currently trading above the September 16 high, which is the top of the month-long trading range.<p>In general, a breakout has a 50% chance of failing. However, this is important resistance. The overnight breakout will probably lead to at least a couple days of sideways to up trading before traders decide if the breakout will fail.<p>The bulls want the 2 week rally to continue up to a new high this month. If they get consecutive closes above the September 16 lower high, the Emini will probably continue up to the September 3 all-time high. At that point, the bulls will want a strong breakout to a new high. But the bears will try to create a reversal down from a double top.<p>At the moment, the odds still are favor a lower high and a 2nd leg sideways to down on the daily chart. But that could chance in the next few days.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. If it opens here, it will gap above the September 10 high. That is the top of a month-long trading range.<p>The bears want the breakout to fail and for the Emini to reverse down strongly on the open. But I have been saying that the rally might continue up to 3500 before the bears will sell aggressively again.<p>Since the bears were unable to get follow-through selling after their big bear day on Tuesday, the odds are that the Emini will get some follow-through buying over the next few days.<p>If there is a trend today, up is slightly more likely. Because the Emini is at major resistance, there is an increased chance of a big breakout above that resistance. That means the bulls have an increased chance of a big bull trend.<p>Trend days usually being in the 1st hour or two. There is a 20% chance of a strong trend up or down that begins within the first few bars. Otherwise, traders will look for early sideways trading. The bulls will try to reverse up from a wedge bottom or double bottom near the EMA. However, the bears will look for a wedge rally or a double top and then a bear trend.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-8.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bears see the 2-week rally as a wedge bear flag at the EMA and the September 2018 high.<p>They triggered the sell signal yesterday, but yesterday was a bull day. The bears will try to get a 2nd reversal down within the next few days.<p>They need a couple bear days to convince traders that the month-long bear trend is intact. Their minimum goal is a test below the June 10 high, which was the breakout point of the July rally. They also want a measured move down from the 2-month trading range.<p>The rally from the September low is a Small Pullback Bull Trend. The bulls want it to break strongly above Tuesday’s high, which is the top of the wedge bear flag. They then want a break above the September 10 lower high.<p>Finally, the want a couple closes above the September 1 high. If they achieve those goals, traders will look for the rally to continue up to 1.25 at the February 2018 high.<p>Even though the EURUSD is still in a 3-month trading range after a 4-month rally, the weekly chart (not shown) has a wedge rally to resistance. Consequently, the odds are still in favor of a test down to the June 10 high before there is a break above the September high. However, a few consecutive bull days will reverse those odds.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a tight trading range for 7 days. This continued overnight. Day traders will continue to look for reversals and small profits. The overnight range has been so small that the scalps have only been 10 pips.<p>Today’s high is exactly at yesterday’s high. Yesterday was a High 1 buy signal bar in a 2-week Small Pullback Bull trend. However, the bulls so far have been unable to trigger the buy.<p>Can today reverse down strongly from a micro double top with Tuesday’s high? Can it break strongly above Tuesday’s high? There has been no energy for 7 days. The odds are against a strong trend today.

It also closed above that high. If the bulls can get a 2nd consecutive bull bar today, there will be a higher chance of the rally continuing to around the top of the 3400 – 3500 sell zone.<p>When the Emini breaks above an important price, it often does sideways for a few days. Yesterday might be the start. Then, after 2 – 3 days, traders decide if the rally will continue or if the breakout will fail. Therefore, there is an increased chance of today being another sideways day.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. This is particularly true in the final hour. So far, this week is a bull bar closing near its high.<p>If today closes near its high, this week will close near the high of the week. Also, it would close above last week’s high and above the top of the September trading range. That would increase the chances of at least slightly higher prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 16 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above yesterday’s high. Because there is an increased chance that yesterday’s break above the month-long trading range will lead to a couple sideways days, there is also an increased chance that the Emini will form a trading range day today. If there is an early selloff that closes the gap up, that could be a sign of a sideways to down day.<p>The Emini yesterday broke above an important price. The next significant resistance is 3480 – 3500. Therefore, the Emini might trend up today. Bull trend days usually form an early low of the day. If there is a reversal up from a failed selloff, or if there are several consecutive bull bars on the open, traders will look for a bull trend today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-channel-and-trading-range-breaakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-9.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel and trading range breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls want this to be a resumption of the 4-month bull trend. They need a breakout above the September 10 lower high to end the 2-month bear trend. The chart would then be back in trading range mode or in a bull trend.<p>The bears always want the opposite. They know that a reversal up from a sell climax usually tests the start of the sell climax. They therefore expect the rally to reach at least the September 21 high. However, they will try to get a reversal down from there, or from a double top with the September 10 or September 1 highs.<p>Right now, the bulls and the bears have about the same probability. A reversal down from a double top will return the chart to a bear trend. The bulls need a couple closes above the September 1 high to convince traders that the rally will continue up to 1.25 at the February 2018 high.<p>Today is Friday so it affects the appearance of the weekly chart. If the EURUSD closes the week right here, there would be a bull bar closing on its high on the weekly chart. That would make higher prices likely next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight. Day traders have only been buying.<p>While the EURUSD has been sideways for a few hours, the trading range is only 15 pips tall. That is not enough for most bears to begin selling yet.<p>The overnight high is exactly at Tuesday’s high, which was the top of a possible wedge bear flag. It is also just below the resistance of the September 2018 high.<p>The bears would like to get a reversal down from here. Today would then be a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a micro double top.<p>But with the pullbacks for 3 hours being less than 15 pips, it is more likely that today will break above Tuesday’s high. The September 2018 high is only 8 pips higher. If the EURUSD breaks above Tuesday’s high, it will probably continue to at least a little above the September 2018 high as well.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a brief, strong breakout to a new high and then another trading range. Today was a trending trading range day.<p>It is important to note that today was the 2nd consecutive daily close above the September 16 top of the month-long trading range. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices early next week.<p>Furthermore, this week closed on its high.

A reversal down from a double top will return the chart to a bear trend. The bulls need a couple closes above the September 1 high to convince traders that the rally will continue up to 1.25 at the February 2018 high.<p>Today is Friday so it affects the appearance of the weekly chart. If the EURUSD closes the week right here, there would be a bull bar closing on its high on the weekly chart. That would make higher prices likely next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight. Day traders have only been buying.<p>While the EURUSD has been sideways for a few hours, the trading range is only 15 pips tall. That is not enough for most bears to begin selling yet.<p>The overnight high is exactly at Tuesday’s high, which was the top of a possible wedge bear flag. It is also just below the resistance of the September 2018 high.<p>The bears would like to get a reversal down from here. Today would then be a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a micro double top.<p>But with the pullbacks for 3 hours being less than 15 pips, it is more likely that today will break above Tuesday’s high. The September 2018 high is only 8 pips higher. If the EURUSD breaks above Tuesday’s high, it will probably continue to at least a little above the September 2018 high as well.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini gapped up and rallied from a wedge bull flag near the EMA. There was a brief, strong breakout to a new high and then another trading range. Today was a trending trading range day.<p>It is important to note that today was the 2nd consecutive daily close above the September 16 top of the month-long trading range. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices early next week.<p>Furthermore, this week closed on its high. There were several gaps up on the weekly chart over the summer, even though most gaps closed. There is an increased chance of a gap up next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Analysis</h2><p>The<strong>SP500 Emini</strong>futures market broke above the September trading range this week. It might gap up on Monday. There is now a 60% chance that this rally will test the September 2 all-time high.<p>The<strong>Bond futures</strong>weekly chart has been in a trading range for 7 months. There is now a 4-month triangle. The chart is in Breakout Mode, but it will probably continue mostly sideways for many more weeks.<p>The weekly<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex chart reversed up over the past 2 weeks after a reversal down from a wedge top. However, the 4-week selloff was probably not enough of a correction after a 4-month rally. Traders expect a lower high and then a 2nd leg sideways to down.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-weekly-chart-has-a-triangle-within-7-month-tight-trading-range\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart has a triangle within 7-month tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-triangle-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-10.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart in triangle after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures sold off for the past 2 weeks, but they are still in a 7-month tight trading range. Consequently, reversals and failed breakouts are more likely than the start of a trend.<p>The bears see the past 7 months as a head and shoulders top bear flag. The neckline is the June 5 low. However, every head and shoulders pattern also is a triangle. The bulls see the past 4 months as a triangle. They therefore are hoping for a reversal up from the August 28 low.<p>But head and shoulders patterns and triangles are trading ranges. Traders know that most breakout attempts up and down fail, resulting in a continuation of the trading range.<p>One of these legs up or down will grow into a trend. But picking which one will be the start of a trend before there is a clear breakout is a low probability bet. Traders will make more money betting on reversals until they see consecutive closes above or below the trading range. They expect the trading range to continue for many more weeks, and possibly for the remainder of the year.<h3 id=\"3-reversal-from-march-buy-climax-is-still-forming-a-trading-range\">Reversal from March buy climax is still forming a trading range</h3><p>March was the end of the most extreme buy climax in the history of the bond market. When there is a reversal down from a buy climax, the chart usually enters a trading range. The bulls want to give the bears at least a couple chances at reversing the trend. If the bears repeatedly fail, the bulls buy again and the bull trend resumes.<p>The weekly bond chart is still deciding between a trend reversal down and a protracted pause in a bull trend. As long as the chart is sideways, the odds are about the same for the bulls and the bears.<p>Since the buy climax was the most extreme in history, the bears have a slightly high probability of a test down to lower support. The nearest significant support is the June 5 low, which is the bottom of the 7-month trading range.<p>Below that is the August 28 high, which it the breakout point of the February/March buy climax. Finally, when there is a reversal down from a buy climax, the market often returns to the bottom of the buy climax, which is the November 7 low.<h2 id=\"4-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-resuming-up-but-the-pullback-might-have-been-too-brief\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart is resuming up, but the pullback might have been too brief</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-Weekly-Chart-Bull-Trend-Resumption-Lower-High-Likely.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-10-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal this week when this week went above last week’s high. This week was a strong bull bar and it closed on its high. That makes higher prices likely next week.<p>It is important to remember that the weekly chart had a wedge climax at major resistance. When there is a reversal down from a wedge buy climax, it is reasonable to expect the pullback to last about half as long as the rally. The current selloff only lasted 4 weeks, but the rally lasted 4 months. Therefore, the 2-week rally will probably lead to a lower high and then a 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>The 4-month rally stalled at the September 2018 high. That was the start of a 2-year bear channel after a strong spike down. When there is a reversal up from a Spike and Channel Bear Trend, the market typically rallies to the start of the channel and then enters a trading range. That will probably happen here.<p>The bulls hope that the 4-week selloff was simply a bull flag. They want the bull trend to resume and break above the September 1 high. That was the top of the 4-month wedge buy climax. If the bulls get a couple closes above that high, traders will look for the trend to continue up to the February 2018 start of the bear trend, at around 1.25.<h3 id=\"6-breakout-points-are-magnets-below\">Breakout points are magnets below</h3><p>While the bulls might achieve their goal within a year, it is more likely that the September reversal down will test major support below. That is what typically happens when a market reverses down from an extreme buy climax at resistance.<p>There is currently better than a 50% chance that the pullback will continue down to below major breakout points. Those are the March 9 high of 1.1496 and the June 10 high of 1.1422.<p>The rally from the March low was a wedge, but it was also a Spike and Channel Bull Trend. The channel began with the June pullback. Therefore, the June 19 low at the bottom of the pullback is an additional magnet below. Will the EURUSD fall that far? At the moment, the bears have a 40% chance.<p>The past 2 months have been mostly sideways. This selloff is not a strong bear trend. However, lower prices over the next few months are still likely. This is true even if the EURUSD first rallies back toward the top of the 3-month trading range.<p>But if the bulls get a couple more consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs, the odds will shift in favor of a breakout above the September high.<h2 id=\"7-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"8-monthly-emini-chart-is-forming-an-ioi-breakout-mode-pattern\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart is forming an ioi Breakout Mode pattern</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-ioi-Breakout-Mode-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart in ioi Breakout Mode after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a big outside down bar in September, but October so far is a bull inside bar. That means its low is above the September low and its high is below the September high. The bar before an outside bar is “inside” of that outside bar. Therefore, there is an ioi (inside-outside-inside) sequence on the monthly chart. This is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>If October remains inside through the end of the month, it will be both a buy and a sell signal bar for next month. Since the monthly chart is in a bull trend, the bulls see October as a brief pullback. It would therefore be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>However, September reversed down from a breakout above the August high and a 10 year bull channel. The bears are hoping that the outside down move in September was the start of a bear trend. They see October as a pause in their new bear trend. If October remains an inside bar, it would be a Low 1 sell signal bar in addition to being a High 1 buy signal bar.<h3 id=\"9-breakout-mode-is-neutral\">Breakout Mode is neutral</h3><p>Let’s assume that October remains an inside bar. When a chart has a breakout mode pattern, there is a 50% chance that that 1st breakout up or down will fail. Furthermore, there is about a 50% chance that there will be a successful bull breakout and about a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout.<p>These numbers vary a little, depending on context (context means the bars to the left). They are higher in a bull trend, like the one currently on the Emini monthly chart. But they are lower when there is a reversal down from a buy climax at resistance, which is also like the Emini monthly chart. If October closes in the middle of its range, traders should assume that the bulls and bears each have a 50% chance. If October closes on its high, the odds will favor the bulls.<h3 id=\"10-buy-climaxes-attract-profit-taking\">Buy climaxes attract profit-taking</h3><p>How much higher can the bull trend go? When there is an extreme buy climax like this, traders are looking to take profits. Therefore, if October remains an inside bar and November triggers the buy signal by going above the October high, the rally will probably only last another bar or two and become a 2nd buy climax. Traders would expect a 2nd reversal down from a micro double top.<p>If that were to happen, there would be a 60% chance of profit-taking. The bulls would sell out of their longs and the bears would begin to short. The selloff at that point would probably have a couple legs sideways to down and it could last 5 to 10 bars. Traders would look for as much as a 50% correction of this year’s rally.<p>Many bulls who take profits want to give the bears a couple chances to create a trend reversal down. That means a lot of bulls will not look to buy aggressively again after profit taking until they see a couple legs down.<p>I said that there would be a 60% chance of profit-taking. That means that there is a 40% chance of the Emini continuing up for several more bars (months) before traders consider taking profits again.<h3 id=\"11-how-likely-is-a-bear-trend-after-an-expanding-triangle-top\">How likely is a bear trend after an expanding triangle top?</h3><p>The monthly chart has been forming higher highs and lower lows for 3 years. This is an expanding triangle. The bears hope that either September was the start of a bear trend or there will be an additional 1 – 2 bars (months) up and then the start of a bear trend.<p>But this potential top is following 5 big bull bars. Even with a possible expanding triangle top, the 1st reversal down will probably be minor. A minor reversal means one that will become either a bull flag or a bear leg in what will evolve into a trading range.<p>There is only a 30% chance that a minor reversal pattern will in fact lead to a major trend reversal. Consequently, the best the bears can probably get in a 1st reversal down, is a pullback to around the middle of the 3-year trading range, before the bulls begin to buy aggressively again.<h3 id=\"12-2-paths-forward\">2 paths forward</h3><p>The are two possible outcomes for the next 6 – 12 months that are most likely. Both involve a micro double top with the September high and both should lead to a couple legs down lasting 5 – 10 months.<p>I already mentioned the first, where October remains an inside bar, November breaks above October, and then there is a reversal down a month or two later from a micro double top with the September high.<p>The 2nd likely outcome is that the Emini continues down for another month or two. The bulls would buy the pullback. Traders would then expect the bull trend to test the old high and probably make a new high.<p>After such a strong buy climax this summer, traders would expect the bulls to take profits after this 2nd buy climax. That would create a micro double top with the September high. Traders would then expect a more prolonged selloff after consecutive buy climaxes, and at least a couple legs sideways to down. That process would probably take 6 – 12 months.<p>Consecutive buy climaxes tend to lead to deeper and more protracted profit taking. Traders would begin to expect a possible two or more legs down to about a 50% retracement of the rally from the March low. This could extend into the middle of next year.<p>Therefore, traders have the same expectation for the coming year whether there is a pullback in November and then a brief new high, or if the Emini continues up in November without pulling back first and then reverses down.<h2 id=\"13-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-is-accelerating-up-from-weak-high-2-bull-flag-at-the-ema\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is accelerating up from weak High 2 bull flag at the EMA</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-bull-trend-resumption-after-High-2-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-10-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart in bull trend resumption after High 2 bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed up 3 weeks ago from a High 2 buy signal at the 20-week EMA. The buy signal bar was not impressive and it followed a buy climax and 3 bear bars. Traders expected a 2 – 3-week bounce and then another leg sideways to down.<p>But this week changed the expectation. This week closed near the high of the bar, and above the minor lower high from 3 weeks ago. It therefore broke above the 4-week trading range.<p>Next week might gap up on the weekly chart. Gaps on the weekly chart are normally uncommon. However, there were many in July and August, although most of the gaps closed before the end of the week. Those prior recent gaps increase the chance of a gap up on Monday.<p>This week was a big bull bar closing on its high. The close above the minor lower high from 3 weeks ago means that this week was a breakout bar. Traders see it as a Surprise Bar.<p>A Surprise Breakout is always a low probability event. Traders were positioned for one thing but got something else. There is usually at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. Therefore, traders will look to buy a 1 to 2-week selloff.<p>If next week is a 2nd consecutive bull bar closing on its high, traders will expect a test of the September all-time high. If next week is a bear bar closing near its low, traders will conclude that this week’s breakout failed.<h3 id=\"14-possible-small-double-top-bear-flag\">Possible small double top bear flag</h3><p>If the Emini turns down next week, traders will wonder if this week was a bull trap. The bears would see this week as the 2nd leg up in a double top bear flag with the minor lower high from 3 weeks ago.<p>A double top bear flag often breaks below the neck line and leads to a measured move down. If the 2nd leg up is strong, there is only a 40% chance of an immediate reversal down to below the neck line (the low of 3 weeks ago) and a measured move down. More often, a reversal down is minor. That means it would just be another leg in the trading range that began in early September.<h2 id=\"15-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-a-confirmed-breakout-above-a-trading-range\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a confirmed breakout above a trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-breakout-above-wedge-top-for-possible-measured-move-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-10-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart breakout above wedge top for possible measured move up\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed down from a buy climax in early September. It was in a trading range for a month.<p>Thursday broke above the top off the range. Additionally, the Emini broke above the top of a wedge rally.<p>Friday was the follow-through bar, and because it also was a bull bar closing above the range, it confirmed the breakout. A confirmed breakout has a 60% chance of a swing up.<p>Traders expect a possible measured move up based on the height of the trading range and the wedge. Also, they expect the rally to have at least 2 legs up. The bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 2-day pullback.<p>Since the buy climax at the all-time high was extreme, it will be resistance. It might prevent the Emini from reaching the measured move target. The bears will try to get a double top with the September 2 all-time high.<p>Can the 2-day breakout fail? Of course, it can, but the bears now have only a 40% chance of a reversal down next week. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top because the bulls will buy the 1st attempt to reverse down.<p>As I wrote above, the Emini might gap up on Monday because of the weekly chart. If the gap stays open and Monday closes near its high, the Emini will probably race up to the old high.<h2 id=\"16-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini is up in the Globex market and it will probably gap up on the weekly chart. There were several weekly gap up openings in the summer rally. Although most closed before the end of the week, they were a sign of strength and led to higher prices.<p>The bulls want the rally to make a new all-time high. There is currently a 50% chance they will succeed. If the Emini can get 2 closes above 3500, the rally will probably test the September 2 all-time high<p>The Emini is in the Sell Zone between 3400 and 3500. The bears will look for a reversal down this week from a lower high.<p>But the bull channel from the September 24 low is tight and there are now 2 consecutive closes above the September 16 top of the month-long trading range. Therefore, the bears will probably need a micro double top before they can get a reversal down. Consequently, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback, expecting a test back up.<p>Last week was a big bull bar on the weekly chart. Sometimes the following week is a big bear bar, like in early June. If today or tomorrow is a big bear day, last week’s bull breakout will probably fail. More likely, with all of the gaps up on the weekly chart this summer, there is an increased chance of a gap up today on the weekly chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 24 points in the Globex session. At the end of Friday, I said that the bulls would try to create a gap up on the weekly chart this week. They probably will succeed.<p>When there is a big gap up on the 5-minute chart, the Emini is far above the 20-bar EMA, which is one measure of the average price. Traders do not like to pay far above average unless they are getting something that is far above average. Many bulls will wait to see a couple big bull bars closing near their highs before buying far above the EMA.<p>Most often, a gap up leads to a trading range open for the 1st hour or two. That is because the 20-bar EMA is based on the most recent 20 bars. It takes that long before the EMA is based mostly on today’s early bars, putting the EMA up near those bars. Traders then see the price as being near average, and the bulls become more willing to buy.<p>There is a 20% chance of a strong bull or bear trend from the open. But if the Emini has its usual trading range open, the bears will look to sell a rally to a double top or a wedge top for a test down to the EMA. They bulls want to buy a reversal up from a double bottom or wedge bottom near the EMA.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-12.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-small-pullback-bull-trend-and-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-12-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex small pullback bull trend and bear channel\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has a wedge rally in a bear trend. The bears want today to close near its low. Today would then be a sell signal bar for a lower high in a bear channel. Also, it would be at the resistance of the September 2018 high and the September 21 sell climax high. They then would hope for another leg down in their bear channel and a test of the June 10 high. That was the breakout point of the summer rally.<p>Since the EURUSD is still in its 3-month trading range, there is always going to be a bull argument as well. The bulls see the 2-week rally as a Small Pullback Bull Trend. They want a breakout above the September 10 lower high. That would end the bear argument because a bear trend needs lower highs. They they would try to break above the September 1 high and continue the rally to 1.25 at the February 2018 high.<p>One problem for the bears is that he 2-week rally is near the September 21 sell climax high but did not reach that magnet. When a market is near a magnet, it usually will get there. Consequently, the EURUSD will probably have to go at least a little higher before the bears can regain control. However, if today closes near its low and tomorrow is a big bear day, traders will conclude that another leg down was underway.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down overnight from 1 pip below yesterday’s high. However, the selloff was a wedge and the bulls got a strong bounce an hour ago. A reversal up from a wedge typically has at least 2 legs. Consequently, the EURUSD might begin to go sideways to up for at least another hour.<p>The bears want a strong sell signal bar on the daily chart. They will sell rallies today to try to get today to close near its low. At the moment, that is unlikely.<p>The decent bounce from a wedge bottom increases the chance that today will not close near its low. Additionally, many traders believe the 3-week rally will have to reach the September 21 sell climax high before the bears will sell. That reduces the chance of a strong sell signal bar today and a strong bear entry bar tomorrow on the daily chart. It therefore also reduces the chance of a big trend down from here on the 5-minute chart.<p>These conflicting signals and the overnight trading range price action make it likely that today will not close on the low, but not become a big bull day. For the bulls, they want today to have a bull body on the daily chart. They will therefore buy 10 – 20 pip dips today.<p>At the moment, traders believe today will be sideways to up. They will look to sell again once there is a 2nd leg up from the wedge bottom. However, both the bulls and bears will probably scalp for 10 – 20 pips.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

On the 5 minute chart, the bulls had a weak rally for more than an hour. But the bull trend became much stronger when it started forming bull bars closing on their highs. Today was a Bull Trend From The Open. There was a late test of the EMA, but the rally to get back to the high of the day started too late to make a new high.<p>There are now 3 consecutive closes above the September trading range on the daily chart. Traders expect a test of the all-time high. Furthermore, the 3 day breakout is strong enough to expect traders to buy the 1st 1 – 2 day reversal down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Furthermore, it was the 3rd consecutive close above the September trading range high. Traders expect a test of the all-time high. Bulls will therefore buy the 1st 1 to 2-day reversal down.<p>Yesterday was an extreme buy climax day on the 5-minute chart. The day after an exhaustive buy climax typically has at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>There is a 50% chance of some follow-through buying in the 1st hour. Can today rally strongly to a new all-time high? While that is possible, the 3 day rally has been extreme. There will probably be at least a one day pullback before there is a new high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 5 points in the Globex session. After yesterday’s big rally and 4 days of strong rallying, the bulls will be inclined to take some profits today. Therefore, today will probably not be a big bull day. If there is an early rally for a couple hours, it will attract profit-taking. Traders will look for a reversal down.<p>Traders expect a trading range. Therefore, they will look for reversals, even if there is a strong trend up or down for 2 – 3 hours. They will swing trade the trend, but know that a reversal will be more likely than today continuing all day as a trend in either direction.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-13.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

After breaking below the range, it reversed back up to the middle of the range and the September 2018 high.<p>The bulls hope that the reversal up will continue to above the September high. The 3-week rally is a Small Pullback Bull Trend. But it is also a wedge, and the EURUSD might be forming a lower high in a bear channel that began with the September high.<p>When a market is in a trading range, it is neutral. The bulls and bears alternate control every few days, but the probability of a bull or breakout stays around 50%. That is the case now.<p>As long as the EURUSD stays below the September 19 lower high, it is slightly more bearish. If the bears get a break below the September low, the chart will become more bearish. If the bulls get a break above the September 1 high, the chart will again be bullish.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low. That triggered a sell signal on the daily chart for a wedge bear flag. But yesterday was a doji bar, which is a weak sell signal bar. Also, the 3-week rally has been in a tight bull channel (a Small Pullback Bull Trend). That is bad context for traders hoping for a resumption of the bear trend. Therefore, the EURUSD bounced up from below yesterday’s low.<p>There were about as many buyers below the sell signal bar as they were sellers. The EURUSD has been mostly sideways overnight. Day traders have been looking for 10-pip scalps up and down.<p>The bears want the day to close far below yesterday’s low to compensate for the weak sell signal bar on the daily chart. At the moment, that is unlikely.<p>The bulls want a strong reversal up to above last week’s high. But the bars and legs have been small overnight, and that, too, is unlikely. Day traders will continue to scalp, unless there are 2 or 3 consecutive big trend bars up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-13-2.png\" alt=\"2f3B7WcGWjbEsAJFZe\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up from several magnets, which were the 3500 Big Round Number, the 60-minute 20-bar EMA, the open of the week, and yesterday’s low.<p>The bears want the Emini to fall below Friday’s high, which was last week’s high.

The bears are trying to close this week’s gap as well.<p>I wrote this morning that the Emini would probably have a pullback this week because 4 consecutive bull bars was getting extreme. Since today traded below yesterday’s low, today was a pullback.<p>It is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. But because it had a bear body, it is a weak buy setup. There might be more sellers than buyers above its high. Consequently, the Emini might go sideways again tomorrow. Traders might want to see one more test of the support at today’s low before they are confident that the 4-day rally will resume.<p>The bears are hoping that the 4-week rally will form a lower high on the daily chart.

Furthermore, it was the 3rd consecutive close above the September trading range high. Traders expect a test of the all-time high. Bulls will therefore buy the 1st 1 to 2-day reversal down.<p>Yesterday was an extreme buy climax day on the 5-minute chart. The day after an exhaustive buy climax typically has at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>There is a 50% chance of some follow-through buying in the 1st hour. Can today rally strongly to a new all-time high? While that is possible, the 3 day rally has been extreme. There will probably be at least a one day pullback before there is a new high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 5 points in the Globex session. After yesterday’s big rally and 4 days of strong rallying, the bulls will be inclined to take some profits today. Therefore, today will probably not be a big bull day. If there is an early rally for a couple hours, it will attract profit-taking. Traders will look for a reversal down.<p>Traders expect a trading range. Therefore, they will look for reversals, even if there is a strong trend up or down for 2 – 3 hours. They will swing trade the trend, but know that a reversal will be more likely than today continuing all day as a trend in either direction.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-13.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

After breaking below the range, it reversed back up to the middle of the range and the September 2018 high.<p>The bulls hope that the reversal up will continue to above the September high. The 3-week rally is a Small Pullback Bull Trend. But it is also a wedge, and the EURUSD might be forming a lower high in a bear channel that began with the September high.<p>When a market is in a trading range, it is neutral. The bulls and bears alternate control every few days, but the probability of a bull or breakout stays around 50%. That is the case now.<p>As long as the EURUSD stays below the September 19 lower high, it is slightly more bearish. If the bears get a break below the September low, the chart will become more bearish. If the bulls get a break above the September 1 high, the chart will again be bullish.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low. That triggered a sell signal on the daily chart for a wedge bear flag. But yesterday was a doji bar, which is a weak sell signal bar. Also, the 3-week rally has been in a tight bull channel (a Small Pullback Bull Trend). That is bad context for traders hoping for a resumption of the bear trend. Therefore, the EURUSD bounced up from below yesterday’s low.<p>There were about as many buyers below the sell signal bar as they were sellers. The EURUSD has been mostly sideways overnight. Day traders have been looking for 10-pip scalps up and down.<p>The bears want the day to close far below yesterday’s low to compensate for the weak sell signal bar on the daily chart. At the moment, that is unlikely.<p>The bulls want a strong reversal up to above last week’s high. But the bars and legs have been small overnight, and that, too, is unlikely. Day traders will continue to scalp, unless there are 2 or 3 consecutive big trend bars up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-13-2.png\" alt=\"2f3B7WcGWjbEsAJFZe\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That makes yesterday a pullback in the 4-day rally. It is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today.<p>But because of its bear body, it is a weak buy setup. Also, traders might want to see one more test of the support around yesterday’s low before they become confident that the 4-day rally will continue up to a new high. That support is the 3500 Big Round Number, the open of the week, and the EMA on the 60-minute chart.<p>Remember that the Emini gapped up on the weekly chart many times this summer. Most of those gaps closed before the week ended. The bears will try to close this week’s gap up as well. Therefore, Friday’s high, which is the bottom of the gap, is another magnet below. If the Emini falls below Friday’s high, it would close the gap on the weekly chart.<p>Can the 4-day rally form a lower high double top with the September high and begin a bear trend? Yes, but the 4-day rally was strong enough so that there will probably be at least one more push up this week. Traders currently expect the rally to get closer to the September all-time high before the bears will try to get a reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 1 point in the Globex session. Since yesterday is a weak buy signal bar on the daily chart, today will probably not rally far above yesterday’s high today. Also, after 4 bull days, today will probably not be a big bear day.<p>Finally, there were several magnets at yesterday’s low. Traders will probably want to test them again today. Consequently, there is an increased chance that today will be a 2nd sideways day. Traders will expect at least one swing up and one swing down. Therefore, if the day begins with a trend, traders will look for either a reversal or a trading range after 2 – 3 hours.<p>Any day can become a trend day. If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, traders will be more willing to hold onto positions. A trading range day is more likely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-14.png\" alt=\"Emini 5-minute Chart Bear Channel and Trading Range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But the sell signal bar 2 days ago was a doji, and the 3-week rally has been a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That is a weak sell setup.<p>While the bears might get a 2nd leg sideways to down over the next few days, they need a big bear day today to convince traders that the wedge was a major sell signal. That is unlikely.<p>The bulls hope that this week will just be another small pullback in a 3-week Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>The dominant feature of the chart is the 3-month trading range. There is now also an 11-day tight trading range. Trading ranges resist change. They tend to continue indefinitely. Consequently, more sideways is more likely than a resumption of this summer’s rally or of the September bear trend. Traders will continue to look for reversals every few days until there are 2 or 3 consecutive big trend days in either direction.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up from below yesterday’s low. The bears needed a 2nd consecutive big bear day today. Traders knew that was unlikely, and they therefore bought the breakout below yesterday’s low, despite yesterday being a big bear day. This is trading range price action.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high so that today will be a credible buy signal bar for tomorrow. They hope that yesterday was just a bear trap and that their 3-week rally is intact. They will therefore buy pullbacks today.<p>The bears know that a big bear day is unlikely at this point. Their goal is simply to stop today from being a strong buy signal bar on the daily chart. They therefore want to sell.<p>But, day traders are not going to sell until they see the overnight reversal up stall and enter a trading range. Once they see a 20 to 30-pip pullback, they will start to sell rallies for scalps.

Today was a Bear Trending Trading Range Day. More importantly, it traded below Friday’s high and therefore closed the gap on the weekly chart. This was likely since most of the weekly gaps this summer closed before the end of the week. However, that rally continued up for many more weeks.<p>Will this rally break to far above the September high? Probably not. The bears want a double top with that high, but will they get a reversal down to below the September low this year? With the strong breakout above the September trading range, the Emini is back to neutral. It might continue sideways up to the election and possibly through the end of the year.<p>The 4-day rally was strong enough for traders to buy the current 2-day pullback. However, they have not bought yet.<p>What happens if the Emini trades back below the October 6 top of the trading range? Nothing. The Emini will still be in a month-long trading range. While it would be good for the bears, they need a strong break below that high to convince traders that the Emini is reversing down from a double top. More likely, it will continue sideways.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bears needed a 2nd consecutive big bear day today. Traders knew that was unlikely, and they therefore bought the breakout below yesterday’s low, despite yesterday being a big bear day. This is trading range price action.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high so that today will be a credible buy signal bar for tomorrow. They hope that yesterday was just a bear trap and that their 3-week rally is intact. They will therefore buy pullbacks today.<p>The bears know that a big bear day is unlikely at this point. Their goal is simply to stop today from being a strong buy signal bar on the daily chart. They therefore want to sell.<p>But, day traders are not going to sell until they see the overnight reversal up stall and enter a trading range. Once they see a 20 to 30-pip pullback, they will start to sell rallies for scalps. Until then, day traders are only looking to buy.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-buy-climax-in-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax in bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was a Bear Trending Trading Range Day. More importantly, it traded below Friday’s high and therefore closed the gap on the weekly chart. This was likely since most of the weekly gaps this summer closed before the end of the week. However, that rally continued up for many more weeks.<p>Will this rally break to far above the September high? Probably not. The bears want a double top with that high, but will they get a reversal down to below the September low this year? With the strong breakout above the September trading range, the Emini is back to neutral. It might continue sideways up to the election and possibly through the end of the year.<p>The 4-day rally was strong enough for traders to buy the current 2-day pullback. However, they have not bought yet.<p>What happens if the Emini trades back below the October 6 top of the trading range? Nothing. The Emini will still be in a month-long trading range. While it would be good for the bears, they need a strong break below that high to convince traders that the Emini is reversing down from a double top. More likely, it will continue sideways.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That would form a 3-day island top on the daily chart.<p>While most island tops and bottoms are minor, the context here is good for the start of a swing down. Traders would wonder if the 4-week rally is reversing down from a double top with the September high. If this week closes on its low, it would be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<p>Remember, this week gapped up on the weekly chart. I said that the gap would probably close before the end of the week. Yesterday’s selloff closed the gap above last week’s high. So far, this week is a bear reversal bar. If the week closes on its low, it will be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<p>The Emini is still in a 2-month trading range. In trading ranges, nothing is clear, and both the bulls and bears get disappointed. A drop below the October 6 high, which was the top of a month-long trading range, will disappoint the bulls, just like last week’s rally disappointed the bears.<p>But in a trading range, the legs up and down don’t last long. Traders look for reversals. However, a couple closes below that October 6 high will make traders believe that this week’s rally was the 2nd leg up in a double top and that the Emini will continue down to test the September low. A strong break below that low will make traders look for a 400-point measured move down to 2800.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 44 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap below yesterday’s low. What happens today can affect what the Emini will do over the next few weeks.<p>If today sells off strongly to far below the October 6 high, traders will wonder if this week’s is reversing down from a double top with the September high.<p>If today rallies from the gap down, traders would see the 3-day selloff as just a breakout test of the top of the top of the September trading range. Today would become a High 1 bull flag on the daily chart, and traders would look for at least a small 2nd leg up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-buy-climax-in-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-15.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax in bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bears hope that the bear channel down from the September 1 high will continue down to below the breakout point of the June 10 high.<p>But so far, the 4-day resumption of the bear trend lacks consecutive big bear bars closing on their lows. That makes the bulls hopeful that it is simply a test of the September 30 low, which was the start of the small wedge rally. The bulls will try to form a double bottom with either that low or the September 25 low.<p>While the daily chart is forming lower highs and lows, it is still in its 3-month trading range. This week makes the chart slightly more bearish, but unless the selloff starts to form consecutive big bear bars, the bulls will continue to buy. They hope that the past 7 weeks are just a pause in a strong bull trend.<p>I mentioned over the weekend that the 2-week reversal up was a Low 1 bear flag on the weekly chart. But I also said that there would probably be more buyers than sellers below its low because last week was a big bull bar and the 2nd consecutive bull bar.<p>That means the bulls have been aggressive. A big bull bar is a low probability sell signal bar. The 1st reversal back down usually does not get far. The EURUSD tested below last week’s low overnight. We will find out if the bulls will buy below the weekly sell signal bar.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to just below last week’s low. That triggered a weekly Low 1 sell signal. But because last week was a big bull bar, it is a weak sell signal bar. There might be more buyers than sellers below.<p>The overnight selloff also is testing the September 30 low on the daily chart. That was the start of the 2-week wedge rally. The bears often take some profits there. This can lead to a bounce and the market going sideways for several bars (days).<h3>Will the weekly and daily support hold?</h3><p>Traders are wondering if the overnight selloff is just a sell vacuum test of the support on the daily and weekly charts or the start of a bear trend. With the 5 minute chart stalling for several hours, the support so far is holding.<p>If the bulls can prevent today from continuing far below the support, many bulls will buy over the next few days. This will result in a trading range instead of a resumption of the bears trend. That would make the chart more neutral instead of bearish.<p>Because the EURUSD has been going sideways for several hours at support, day traders are willing to buy. While the overnight selloff was strong enough to make a bull trend reversal unlikely today, the sideways trading at support reduces the chance of much lower prices today. Therefore, the 3-hour trading range will probably continue. Day traders will buy and sell for 10 to 20-pips scalps.<p>The bears will try to get today to close on its low and below the support. That would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow. However, the bulls will try to get today to close above the support and back above the midpoint of the day’s range. Most likely, today will continue its trading range and close around the support or a little above.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-channel-after-big-gap-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel after big gap down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, island tops and bottoms typically are minor patterns. The Emini rallied from the open in a bull channel for the 1st half of the day and then in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for the 2nd half. It closed the gap below yesterday’s low.<p>Because today had a bull body on the daily chart, it is a buy signal bar for tomorrow. Since it is the 1st buy signal since Monday’s high, it is a High 1 buy signal. The bulls hope that the 3 day selloff was simply a test of the breakout point at the October 6 high.<p>It might be, but after a sharp pullback, many bulls will prefer to buy after they see a micro double bottom. That reduces the chance of a big bull day tomorrow.<p>Tomorrow is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important. The most important price is this week’s open. The bears want the week to close below the open. The candlestick on the weekly chart would then have a bear body. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>But the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 months. Traders are looking for reversals every few days. A reversal up next week would be no more important than this week’s reversal down. Until there is a sustained move up or down, traders will expect the trading range to continue.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bears were hoping that this was the start of a reversal down from a double top with the September high, and the start of a bear trend. But yesterday rallied from the open and closed the gap below Wednesday’s low. There will probably be at least a small test up before the bears will try again.<p>The bulls are hoping that the Emini will now reverse up from the pullback to test the October 6 high. That is the top of a month-long trading range within the 2-month trading range. They see the 3-day selloff as an Emini breakout test for last week’s breakout. Since the 3-day selloff was fast and deep, the Emini might have to go sideways for a couple days before the bulls will be able to resume last week’s rally.<p>Because today is Friday, weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the last hour. Traders will pay attention to the open of the week. The bulls want today to close above Monday’s open. This week’s candlestick would then have a bull body, which would reduce the chance of a reversal down next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 12 points in the Globex session. Since yesterday is a reasonable buy signal bar near support on the daily chart, today will probably trade above yesterday’s high. That will trigger the buy signal.<p>In fact, the Emini will probably gap above yesterday’s high on the open. If the gap is small, traders will look for it to close in the 1st hour.<p>But they will also look for a reversal up from any early selloff. This is because there are a couple magnets above. Both are near one another. There is the 3500 Big Round Number and the Open of the week. The bulls will try to prevent this week’s candlestick on the weekly chart from having a bear body.<p>The open of the week is only about 10 points above the current Globex price. When a market is near a magnet, it usually will reach the magnet. It will then decide whether to reverse down or break above.<p>After this week’s Big Up, Big Down, there is Big Confusion. That tends to result in a lot of trading range trading. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a trading range day today with the day closing around the open of the week. This week’s candlestick would then be a doji, which is a 1-bar trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-channel-after-big-gap-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-16.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel after big gap down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-double-bottom-bull-flag-and-wedge-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double bottom bull flag and wedge bear flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart sold off this week from a wedge bear flag at the September 2018 high. The selloff lacked consecutive big bear bars and therefore has not been strong.<p>The selloff stopped yesterday at the September 30 start of the wedge. The bulls are trying to get a double bottom reversal up from that low.<p>This is still trading range price action, as it has been for 3 months. The chart looks bearish for a few days and then bullish. Neither side can maintain control. The result is reversals every few days. There is always both a bull and bear pattern. Until there are consecutive closes above or below the 3-month range, traders will continue to bet on reversals.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up from yesterday’s low overnight. There is now a double bottom bull flag with the September 30 low on the daily chart.<p>While the overnight rally has not been especially strong, it erased most of yesterday’s selloff. So far, day traders have only been buying. But they have not been buying aggressively since the range is relatively small.<p>This rally will probably convert into a trading range. Once there is a 20 to 30-pip pullback, the bears will begin to sell rallies for scalps. Until then, day traders will only buy. But, since today is already about the size of an average day and the rally has not been very strong, there might not be much left to the rally.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-parahbolic-wedge-top-then-trend-resumption-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge top then trend resumption down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bears got strong trend resumption down into the close.<p>While today was only a bear doji on the weekly chart, it was a bear reversal bar on the daily chart. It is a sell signal bar for Monday.<p>The Emini might have to pull back to below the October 6 high before the bulls will try for a new high. Whether or not there is a high, the bulls will have a hard time breaking far above the September high. The bears have a 40% chance of a double top and a strong break below the September low.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Over the past 3 months, the trading range is also a triangle. Any trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. That means there is about a 50% chance of a breakout in either direction. Also, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout will fail.<p>Everyone knows that the Fed said it will not raise rates for the next year. But they only control short-term rates.

That means that the bond futures can only go sideways to down. But what is the path?<h3 id=\"3-why-are-the-bonds-not-selling-off\">Why are the bonds not selling off?</h3><p>If everyone know that, why aren’t bonds going down now? Markets are based on where traders think the price will go in the future. If rates cannot go down, they will eventually go up. Why isn’t the bond futures market selling off? Because of the time frame.<p>Yes, the bond market will probably be lower 5 to 10 years from now. It might even be significantly lower in a few months. But it can stay sideways for a long time before it starts to fall. Also, it could first even get back above the March high without interest rates reaching zero.<p>This uncertainty is what is preventing the selloff in bond prices.

But the only consensus at the moment is that the price is about right.<h3 id=\"4-traders-can-only-make-money-based-on-price-action\">Traders can only make money based on price action</h3><p>Investors and traders are different. Investors hold positions for months to years. For them, fundamentals are important.<p>As a trader, I am only interested in days to weeks. I cannot make money as a trader if I place trades based on my analysis of the fundamentals. They play out over months to years. The only way to trade profitably is by looking at the charts. They tell me what the institutions are currently doing and what is likely over the next few weeks.<p>For 7 months, the institutions have been buying low, selling high, and taking quick profits. That is the only way to trade bond futures right now. At some point, the futures will break out in either direction. Once they do, traders will be willing to hold onto positions for several weeks. Remember, though, they will trade lower for many years, but they might trade higher for several months first.<p>However, that is not today. Now, every time the bond market gets near the bottom of the range, like it did last week, traders buy for a 3 – 5 day bounce. They then take profits and look for the next trade.<h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"6-eurusd-weekly-chart-should-have-2-nd-leg-down-from-nested-wedge-top\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart should have 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down from nested wedge top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-3-month-trading-range-after-wedge-top-so-breakout-mode-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-17-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart 3 month trading range after wedge top so breakout mode\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart sold off this week after a 2-week rally. The bulls want the rally to be a resumption of the 4-month bull trend.<p>The bears are hoping that the 2-week bounce was a pullback from the big reversal down 3 weeks ago. There was a 4-month rally with 3 pushes up this summer. That is a wedge, which is a type of buy climax. There was a smaller wedge nested in the 3rd leg up, which is a stronger sell setup. The bears see the 2-week bounce as a bear flag and expect lower prices.<p>But consecutive bull bars is a low probability sell setup. There might be many buyers below last week’s low. That reduces the chance of a big selloff next week. However, a 2nd leg down is likely soon.<p>The 4-month rally ended at the September 2018 high. There has been some profit-taking, but not much. After a buy climax, the bulls usually wait for 2 legs sideways to down before looking to buy again. That big bear bar 3 weeks ago was a 1st leg down. Since this week also sold off, it met the minimum objective of a 2nd leg, but sideways.<h3 id=\"7-how-long-will-the-correction-last\">How long will the correction last?</h3><p>Will the EURUSD continue down? It should. One other parameter that profit-takers consider before buying again is the duration of the selloff. They typically want it to last about half as long as the buy climax.<p>That rally lasted 4 months. This selloff has lasted only 4 weeks. Many traders believe that the EURUSD will probably continue sideways to down for at least a few more weeks.<p>Remember, the pullback from the wedge buy climax can be sideways, as it has been. It more often is down. Therefore, it is more likely that the selloff will not end until it falls at least a little below that September 25 low.<p>Another factor is that a strong bull breakout usually has a pullback down to the breakout point. That is the June 10 high of 1.1422, which is below the September low. Sometimes the pullback from a buy climax goes all the way to the bottom of the final leg up. That was the June 19 low of 1.1168.<h3 id=\"8-is-the-bull-trend-resuming\">Is the bull trend resuming?</h3><p>What happens if next week is a bull bar closing near its high? Then traders will begin to believe that the correction from the wedge buy climax might be over. The bulls will start to buy again.<p>But it is important to realize that the weekly chart has been in a tight trading range for 3 months. Trading ranges resist breaking out. Even if the bulls get a 2 to 3-week rally, unless it breaks strongly above the September 1 high of 1.2011, it is more likely that the rally will be just a bull leg in the trading range. Traders will look for a reversal back down in the range.<h2 id=\"9-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"10-monthly-emini-chart-has-an-ioi-breakout-mode-pattern\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has an ioi Breakout Mode pattern</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-expanding-triangle-and-ioi-so-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has expanding triangle and ioi so breakout mode\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart so far has a bull inside bar in October.

Big bars tend to attract profit-takers, as you can see this week. Also, the Emini is just below the all-time high where it reversed down sharply in early September. Traders wondered if it would reverse down strongly again. The lack of follow-through buying this week surprised no one.<p>What about next week? The bears want the 4-week rally to be the 2nd leg up in a double top with the September 2 high. Sometimes the 2nd leg up in a double top is a very strong rally, like this one. But that is the exception. There is only a 30% chance that this week is the start of a reversal down from a double top that will lead to a bear trend. The bears will probably need a micro double top before they can get a reversal down.<h3 id=\"12-confusion-is-a-sign-of-a-trading-range\">Confusion is a sign of a trading range</h3><p>If not a bear trend, then what? Whenever you look at a chart and you can see a good reason to buy and a good reason to sell, the chart is in a trading range. Since trading ranges resist breaking out, a continuation of the range is always the most likely possibility for the next bar or two.<p>The Emini might selloff for a week or two, but after a surprisingly strong 4-week rally, the bulls will buy the selloff. That should prevent this week from being the start of a collapse down to below the September 24 low. That is the neckline of the double top.<h3 id=\"13-trading-range-could-last-for-months\">Trading range could last for months</h3><p>The 3-month trading range could continue through the end of the year. But that is not likely. If the bulls get their break to a new all-time high, the 5-month buy climax will be even more extreme. That should limit the upside.<p>If the bears get a reversal down, the Emini could fall for a measured move based on the 400-point tall double top. That would be around 2800, which is approximately a 50% retracement of the 5-month rally. The bulls will probably buy that selloff, even if it lasts a couple months.<p>With limited upside and downside, the Emini will probably be mostly sideways for several more months. Traders are not yet sure exactly where the top and bottom of the range will be.<h2 id=\"14-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-might-get-one-more-leg-up-before-major-reversal-down\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart might get one more leg up before major reversal down</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-weak-sell-signal-for-lower-high-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-17-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has weak sell signal for lower high double top\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been rallying up from a 10% correction in September. If the Emini breaks above the October 12 high, but then reverses down, there would be a wedge rally to a double top. That is a common major reversal pattern. The 1st leg up in the wedge was the September 16 lower high. In this case, there was a new low after that 1st leg up.<p>When a market transitions from up to down or down to up, there is often a time when both trends coexist. The bulls and bears alternate control during the transition. That means the 1st leg of a bull trend can begin before the final leg of a bear trend. Also, the 1st leg of a bear trend often begins before the final leg of a bull trend ends.<p>Can the 4-week rally continue to far above the September high? There is currently a 30% chance that it could go up for a couple months to above 3700.<p>What happens if there is a rally over the next couple weeks and then a reversal down from a double top with the September 2 all-time high? As I said, a wedge rally to a double top is a reliable major reversal pattern.<p>If one forms and there is a good sell signal bar, the math would be good for the bears. They would have a 40% chance of a selloff to at least the September low. They would also have a 30% chance of a break below that low, and a measured move down to around 2800. Each new bar gives new information. These probabilities change with the new information.<h3 id=\"15-what-to-expect-next-week\">What to expect next week?</h3><p>The Emini broke strongly above the October 6 high, which was a double top with the September 16 high and the top of a 4-week trading range. The breakout had 3 consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. That is strong enough for traders to expect a 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>It is possible that Friday’s high was a 2nd sideways leg and the end of the rally. It is more likely that Friday’s sell signal will be minor. The 3-day selloff was surprisingly strong. Traders therefore expect a test of the bottom of the selloff. That was Thursday’s low.<p>Also, the Emini has been in a trading range for 3 months. When it is in a trading range, experienced traders expect disappointment. A common form of disappointment is that there is usually a pullback below a breakout point, even when the breakout is strong.<p>Additionally, if this is a wedge rally, which is likely, the pullback from the 2nd leg up usually dips below the top of the 1st leg up. That is the September 16 high, which is just below the October 6 breakout point. Therefore, the Emini will probably dip below the October 6 high next week.<p>Because the breakout was so strong, the bulls should buy around that support. They expect at 2nd leg up to above the top of the 1st leg up, which was this week’s high.<p>But if there is a 2nd leg up to above the 1st leg, it would be meeting the resistance of the September 2 all-time high. A reversal down at that point would be a double top. Also, the rally would be a wedge. As I said above, a wedge rally to a double top is a strong major trend reversal pattern. Therefore, there will be many traders looking to sell above this week’s high.<h2 id=\"16-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, it had a small bear body and a big tail below. That is a weak sell signal bar. Also, it followed a strong 4-day rally the week before. This is only a minor sell setup. If today trades below Friday’s low and triggers the sell signal, there will probably be buyers below.<p>The bulls want a resumption of the breakout above the September 16/October 6 double top. But because the 3-day selloff was steep, many traders expect at least a small 2nd leg down.<p>Since the chart has been in a a trading range for 3 months, traders know that a pullback from a breakout usually dips below the breakout point. Therefore, the daily chart might have to dip below the October 6 high before the bulls will lift it above the October 12 high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 26 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap far above Friday’s close.<p>A big gap up means the Emini will be far above the 20 bar EMA. That is a measure of the average price. Traders do not like to pay far above average unless they are buying something that is far above average. Many bulls will only buy on the open if there are a couple big bull bars closing on their highs.<p>More likely, the Emini will enter a trading range for at least an hour or two. The bears will look to sell a wedge rally or a double top in the 1st couple hours for a swing down to the EMA. The bulls will wait until the chart gets near the EMA before buying. They want to see either a double bottom or a wedge bottom near the EMA.<p>Friday’s range was big and today will open in the middle 3rd of that range. Friday had a Big Down move and today’s open is a Big Up move. That creates Big Confusion. There is also confusion on the daily chart, which has been in a trading range for 2 months. This increases the chance of a sideways day today. There will probably be sellers around Friday’s high and buyers around Friday’s low.<p>While a trading range day is likely today, the overnight range is big as are the recent bars on the daily chart. Therefore, there will likely be at least one swing up and one swing down today.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-parahbolic-wedge-top-then-trend-resumption-down-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-19.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge top then trend resumption down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It is therefore currently also in an early bear trend and an early resumption of the 4-month bull trend. Traders see the chart as being in Breakout Mode. They are looking for reversals every week or two as they wait for a successful breakout.<p>Today so far is a big bull bar. The EURUSD rallied from a double bottom bull flag with the September 30 low. That low was the start of a small wedge rally and therefore a magnet.<p>If today closes near its high, it will increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow. Traders will look for a test of the October 9 lower high.<p>A more important lower high is September 9. A bear trend needs lower highs. A break above that high would end the series of lower highs and therefore end the bear trend. The chart would then be in both a trading range and a bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly overnight. Day traders have only been buying, mostly for a swing up.<p>Because the rally has been climactic, the bulls will begin to take profits. If there is a 20 to 30-pip pullback, day traders will switch to buying selloffs for scalps and selling reversals down for scalps. This will probably begin within an hour because the 5 minute chart is extremely climactic and the day’s range is already fairly big.<p>Can today reverse down? Probably not. If it does, it will typically have to stop going up and enter a trading range for a couple hours first. The best the bears can reasonably hope to achieve is getting the day to close 20 – 30 pips down from the high. That would make tomorrow more likely to be sideways than up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That triggered a sell signal on the daily chart. It continued down to below last week’s low, which triggered a weekly sell signal for a double top.<p>Finally, the Emini fell below the September 16 high.<a aria-label=\"I wrote over the weekend that this was likely (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-breakout-test-september-trading-range-high/#14-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-might-get-one-more-leg-up-before-major-reversal-down\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">I wrote over the weekend that this was likely</a>at some point this week. If the rally from the September 16 high was going to be a wedge, traders expected this week’s selloff to go below that high before the Emini reversed up.<p>Where does the Emini go from here? While it could go a little lower, there will likely be buyers not far below the September 16 low. Therefore, there will probably not be much more down this week.<p>This is true unless, of course, the double top on the weekly chart has taken control. Then the Emini could continue down for a couple months. It is currently more likely that it will bounce by the end of this week for a test of last week’s high, but 2 or 3 consecutive big bear days will make the bear case more likely.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That low was the start of a small wedge rally and therefore a magnet.<p>If today closes near its high, it will increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow. Traders will look for a test of the October 9 lower high.<p>A more important lower high is September 9. A bear trend needs lower highs. A break above that high would end the series of lower highs and therefore end the bear trend. The chart would then be in both a trading range and a bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly overnight. Day traders have only been buying, mostly for a swing up.<p>Because the rally has been climactic, the bulls will begin to take profits. If there is a 20 to 30-pip pullback, day traders will switch to buying selloffs for scalps and selling reversals down for scalps. This will probably begin within an hour because the 5 minute chart is extremely climactic and the day’s range is already fairly big.<p>Can today reverse down? Probably not. If it does, it will typically have to stop going up and enter a trading range for a couple hours first. The best the bears can reasonably hope to achieve is getting the day to close 20 – 30 pips down from the high. That would make tomorrow more likely to be sideways than up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That triggered a sell signal on the daily chart. It continued down to below last week’s low, which triggered a weekly sell signal for a double top.<p>Finally, the Emini fell below the September 16 high.<a aria-label=\"I wrote over the weekend that this was likely (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-breakout-test-september-trading-range-high/#14-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-might-get-one-more-leg-up-before-major-reversal-down\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">I wrote over the weekend that this was likely</a>at some point this week. If the rally from the September 16 high was going to be a wedge, traders expected this week’s selloff to go below that high before the Emini reversed up.<p>Where does the Emini go from here? While it could go a little lower, there will likely be buyers not far below the September 16 low. Therefore, there will probably not be much more down this week.<p>This is true unless, of course, the double top on the weekly chart has taken control. Then the Emini could continue down for a couple months. It is currently more likely that it will bounce by the end of this week for a test of last week’s high, but 2 or 3 consecutive big bear days will make the bear case more likely.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Or, have the bears taken control and has a double top reversal down begun?<p>We will find out this week. If there are 2 or 3 consecutive big bear days, the Emini would probably be reversing down from the double top. If so, this could be the start of a selloff that could last a month or two. But if there is a reversal up in the next couple days, the Emini will probably test last week’s high. Since trends resist reversing, the bull case is slightly more likely<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 15 points in the Globex session. However, that is not much, given how big the selloff and bars were at the end of yesterday. If there is a gap up, it will be relatively small. Small gaps usually close in the 1st hour or two, which means the Emini might test yesterday’s close.<p>Yesterday ended with a sell climax. There is a 50% chance of some follow-though selling on the open, but only a 25% chance of a 2nd consecutive big bear day.<p>The bears will probably take some profits today. That typically leads to at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>Can today completely reverse yesterday’s selloff? Probably not in one day. However, the Emini is at the important support of the September 16 high. Traders this week will therefore look for either a reversal up or a strong break below. The reversal up is slightly more likely because of the strong 4-week rally into early October.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-20.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

A triangle has formed over the past 6 weeks. It does not matter what you call it. All that is important is that the chart is sideways around the September 2018 high with the bulls and bears alternating control every week or two.<p>Every trading range is also both a bull and bear trend. This is a Breakout Mode pattern. Traders believe the market is balanced and that there is about a 50% chance of either a successful bull or bear breakout.<p>A bear trend needs lower highs. If the bulls get a break above the September 10 high, traders would stop thinking that there is a bear trend.<p>A bull trend needs higher lows. If the bears get a break below the September 25 low, traders would stop thinking that the EURUSD is still in a bull trend.<p>The EURUSD is now at the September 2018 high, which has been resistance for 4 months. Furthermore, there have not been more than 2 strong bull days since August. Therefore, the 2-day rally might stall tomorrow instead of continuing straight up to test the September 10 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight continued yesterday’s rally. Day traders have only been buying. However, the EURUSD is now back at the September 2018 high, which has been the most important price for 4 months. Consequently, the 2-day rally will probably begin to stall today or tomorrow.<p>But until there is a 20 – 30-pip pullback, day traders will continue to only look to buy. Because the daily chart is now at resistance, the bulls will start to take profits. This should create a 20 – 30-pip pullback today. If it does, day traders will begin to sell reversals down from prior highs for scalps, in addition to looking for buys.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-lower-low-double-bottom-and-then-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low double bottom and then bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The cash index did not quite reach the February high, which has been an important magnet. Consequently, the Emini might have to fall a little further before the bulls will return.<p>Since yesterday was a big bear day closing on its low, today was not a strong follow-through day for the bears.

This is because the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 months and breakouts usually fall below breakout points. September 16 was the breakout point for the rally 2 weeks ago.<p>The pullback in the cash index has not quite reached the February high, which has been an important magnet. That target is 26 points below Monday’s low. Also the 5-day selloff was strong enough so that a 3rd leg down would not surprise traders. Therefore, the bulls might want the selloff to fall a little more before they look for a reversal back up.<p>At the moment, the odds favor higher prices, but the Emini might have to fall about 26 points below Monday’s low so that the cash index will test the February high. But, if there is a rally above last week’s high and then a reversal down, there would be a wedge rally to a double top, and that is a good sell setup.<p>Can today be a big bear day, which would be a 2nd leg down after Monday’s big selloff? Yes, but the Emini is at important support. Also, yesterday was a doji day and therefore the bears failed to get immediate strong, follow-through selling. That means the bears are not as strong as they could be, and that reduces the chance of a big selloff to far below the September 16 high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Yesterday rallied and sold off to around the open. It was a trading range day and an inside day. That is a sign of hesitation and uncertainty. The bulls want the rally from 2 weeks ago to resume. However, the cash index might have to fall to the February high before the bulls will buy again.<p>Uncertainty usually results in sideways trading. That increases the chance of more sideways trading today.<p>Can the cash index collapse to far below its February high? It is more likely that there will be buyers there. Consequently, that will limit the downside in the Emini today.<p>Can the Emini rally strongly to above yesterday’s high and then continue up to last week’s high? Traders believe that the 6-day selloff is a pullback and not a reversal. That increases the chance of a big bull trend day coming at any time.<p>However, the Emini has been mostly sideways for 4 days. That makes more sideways trading likely again today. The legs up and down have been big enough for intraday swing trading.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-lower-low-double-bottom-and-then-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-21.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low double bottom and then bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There will eventually be a successful breakout and a measured move up or down. But until there is a breakout, each strong rally and selloff is more likely to reverse than lead to a trend.<p>The bulls want this rally to continue up to above the September 10 lower high and then above the September high. If they get consecutive closes above the September high, traders will conclude that the summer rally is resuming.<p>The bears expect a reversal down from around where the EURUSD is now and the September high. They see the rally since the September low as just 2 legs up in a trading range. This is just the mirror image of the 2 legs down to the September 25 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market continued its 3-day rally overnight. But, unlike the past 3 days, there was a 30-pip selloff overnight.<p>I have been saying that the rally would probably reach the September 21 sell climax high because that is what normally happens in a trading range. Now what? The momentum up is strong enough for the rally to continue at least a little higher, like to the September 10 lower high.<p>However, the overnight 30-pip selloff is a sign that the bulls are starting to take profits on rallies and that the bear day traders are again willing to sell reversals down. The 5-minute chart has been in a trading range for 6 hours. Day traders have been buying and selling for 10 – 20 pip scalps.<p>Traders know that the momentum up has been strong enough so that the rally will probably go at least a little higher over the next few days and reach the September 10 lower high. But the chart might pause for a couple days first.<p>Can the EURUSD reverse down abruptly today? That is unlikely. After 2 days where traders bought 10 – 20-pip selloffs, they will probably buy the 1st one-day pullback.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-day-with-bull-trap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with bull trap\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is because the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 months and breakouts usually fall below breakout points. September 16 was the breakout point for the rally 2 weeks ago.<p>The pullback in the cash index has not quite reached the February high, which has been an important magnet. That target is 26 points below Monday’s low. Also the 5-day selloff was strong enough so that a 3rd leg down would not surprise traders. Therefore, the bulls might want the selloff to fall a little more before they look for a reversal back up.<p>At the moment, the odds favor higher prices, but the Emini might have to fall about 26 points below Monday’s low so that the cash index will test the February high. But, if there is a rally above last week’s high and then a reversal down, there would be a wedge rally to a double top, and that is a good sell setup.<p>Can today be a big bear day, which would be a 2nd leg down after Monday’s big selloff? Yes, but the Emini is at important support. Also, yesterday was a doji day and therefore the bears failed to get immediate strong, follow-through selling. That means the bears are not as strong as they could be, and that reduces the chance of a big selloff to far below the September 16 high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Yesterday rallied and sold off to around the open. It was a trading range day and an inside day. That is a sign of hesitation and uncertainty. The bulls want the rally from 2 weeks ago to resume. However, the cash index might have to fall to the February high before the bulls will buy again.<p>Uncertainty usually results in sideways trading. That increases the chance of more sideways trading today.<p>Can the cash index collapse to far below its February high? It is more likely that there will be buyers there. Consequently, that will limit the downside in the Emini today.<p>Can the Emini rally strongly to above yesterday’s high and then continue up to last week’s high? Traders believe that the 6-day selloff is a pullback and not a reversal. That increases the chance of a big bull trend day coming at any time.<p>However, the Emini has been mostly sideways for 4 days. That makes more sideways trading likely again today. The legs up and down have been big enough for intraday swing trading.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-lower-low-double-bottom-and-then-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-21.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low double bottom and then bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders are deciding if the selloff has gone far enough or it the cash index has to fall a little more to its February high before the buyers will return. Less likely, the Emini has begun a bear trend from a double top.<p>If there was a reversal up from below Tuesday’s low, there would be a micro wedge bottom on the daily chart. Also, the cash index might be down at its February high. That would attract buyers.<p>A market has inertia. It tends to continue what it has been doing. Therefore, traders today will expect a lot of trading range price action on the 5-minute chart. That means at least one leg up and one leg down.<p>The Emini is in Breakout Mode on the daily chart. While traders expect this selloff to end within a few days and for the rally of 2 weeks ago to resume, they know that there could instead be a bear breakout below the micro wedge bull flag. They therefore will be willing to swing trade up or down if there is a strong breakout with follow-through. Remember, the cash index might have to fall another 50 points to test its February high. If it does, the Emini will also fall about 50 points.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini overnight sold off to below Tuesday’s low. If it reverses up from here, there would be a micro wedge on the Globex chart.<p>The bulls would have a stronger buy setup if the day session dips below Tuesday’s low and then reverses up. That would create a micro wedge on the day session chart as well.<p>The past 2 days were doji bars on the daily chart. A doji is neutral. It means that the Emini went up and down, but closed where it started.<p>With traders wondering if there will be a stimulus package before the election and with the uncertainty about tonight’s US presidential debate, there are fundamental reasons why the Emini might have a lot of trading range trading again today. Coming into the day, day traders expect trading range price action. But if there is a strong, sustained move up or down, they will change to trend trading.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-day-with-bull-trap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-22.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with bull trap\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This happened with the Selloff from the September 1 high to the September 25 low. It might now be happening with the rally up from the September 25 low. If the EURUSD reverses down from here, the reversal would be a Low 2 sell signal in a bear channel that began on September 1.<p>However, trading ranges resist breaking into trends. Traders expect reversals. Therefore, if today is a sell signal bar on the daily chart, the reversal down will probably just be a bear leg in the trading range instead of a resumption of the bear trend.<p>This is especially true after 3 strong bull days. Also, the September 10 lower high is a major lower high and it is not far above. When a magnet is nearby, a market usually tests it. That further reduces the chance that today will be the start of the resumption of the bear trend. More likely, today will lead to a 1 – 3-day pullback, and then the bulls will again try to break above the September 10 lower high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from a double top overnight. A double top is a trading range. The breakout below the neck line is now near a measured move down.<p>Also, the day’s range is almost as big as the average range for the past several days. Consequently, there may not be much left to the selloff. If the selling stops, the EURUSD will probably transition into another trading range. Today would be a trending trading range day. This is what is most likely.<p>For the past several hours, day traders have only been selling. But since a lower trading range will probably begin to form, they will begin to buy reversals up. Unless there is a surprisingly strong reversal up, they will also sell rallies.<p>That is what happens in trading ranges. Traders buy low, sell high, and take quick profits. Less likely, the bear trend will continue much lower or it will reverse back up into a bull trend.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-Low-2-bear-flag-then-cup-and-handle-and-head-and-shoulders-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 bear flag then cup and handle and head and shoulders bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was also a Cup and Handle bottom and a Head and Shoulders bottom.<p>Today closed near its high. It is a buy signal bar for tomorrow. There is now a micro wedge bull flag on the daily chart, which I said was likely. Traders expect higher prices tomorrow.<p>What happens if there is a surprise in tonight’s debate or with the stimulus package? While unlikely, either could result in a collapse below the wedge bottom. But at the moment, traders expect at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Therefore, traders today will expect a lot of trading range price action on the 5-minute chart. That means at least one leg up and one leg down.<p>The Emini is in Breakout Mode on the daily chart. While traders expect this selloff to end within a few days and for the rally of 2 weeks ago to resume, they know that there could instead be a bear breakout below the micro wedge bull flag. They therefore will be willing to swing trade up or down if there is a strong breakout with follow-through. Remember, the cash index might have to fall another 50 points to test its February high. If it does, the Emini will also fall about 50 points.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini overnight sold off to below Tuesday’s low. If it reverses up from here, there would be a micro wedge on the Globex chart.<p>The bulls would have a stronger buy setup if the day session dips below Tuesday’s low and then reverses up. That would create a micro wedge on the day session chart as well.<p>The past 2 days were doji bars on the daily chart. A doji is neutral. It means that the Emini went up and down, but closed where it started.<p>With traders wondering if there will be a stimulus package before the election and with the uncertainty about tonight’s US presidential debate, there are fundamental reasons why the Emini might have a lot of trading range trading again today. Coming into the day, day traders expect trading range price action. But if there is a strong, sustained move up or down, they will change to trend trading.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-day-with-bull-trap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-22.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with bull trap\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This happened with the Selloff from the September 1 high to the September 25 low. It might now be happening with the rally up from the September 25 low. If the EURUSD reverses down from here, the reversal would be a Low 2 sell signal in a bear channel that began on September 1.<p>However, trading ranges resist breaking into trends. Traders expect reversals. Therefore, if today is a sell signal bar on the daily chart, the reversal down will probably just be a bear leg in the trading range instead of a resumption of the bear trend.<p>This is especially true after 3 strong bull days. Also, the September 10 lower high is a major lower high and it is not far above. When a magnet is nearby, a market usually tests it. That further reduces the chance that today will be the start of the resumption of the bear trend. More likely, today will lead to a 1 – 3-day pullback, and then the bulls will again try to break above the September 10 lower high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from a double top overnight. A double top is a trading range. The breakout below the neck line is now near a measured move down.<p>Also, the day’s range is almost as big as the average range for the past several days. Consequently, there may not be much left to the selloff. If the selling stops, the EURUSD will probably transition into another trading range. Today would be a trending trading range day. This is what is most likely.<p>For the past several hours, day traders have only been selling. But since a lower trading range will probably begin to form, they will begin to buy reversals up. Unless there is a surprisingly strong reversal up, they will also sell rallies.<p>That is what happens in trading ranges. Traders buy low, sell high, and take quick profits. Less likely, the bear trend will continue much lower or it will reverse back up into a bull trend.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-Low-2-bear-flag-then-cup-and-handle-and-head-and-shoulders-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 bear flag then cup and handle and head and shoulders bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was also a Cup and Handle bottom and a Head and Shoulders bottom.<p>Today closed near its high. It is a buy signal bar for tomorrow. There is now a micro wedge bull flag on the daily chart, which I said was likely. Traders expect higher prices tomorrow.<p>What happens if there is a surprise in tonight’s debate or with the stimulus package? While unlikely, either could result in a collapse below the wedge bottom. But at the moment, traders expect at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That would create a 6-day Emini micro wedge bull flag and a breakout test of the September 16 high, which was the breakout point of the rally 2 weeks ago. The bulls got their wish. Yesterday reversed up and it is now the buy signal bar for the pattern.<p>Traders expect today to go above yesterday’s high, which would trigger the buy signal. There is an increased chance of a rally today.<p>Can the Emini instead selloff? For example, can it trigger the buy signal and reverse down to below yesterday’s low forming an outside down day? Possible, but not likely. But because it has been sideways for several days, the chance of a big bull day is less than what traders might think after yesterday’s strong buy signal bar on the daily chart.<h3>Weekly support and resistance are important on Fridays</h3><p>Today is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The most important weekly target has been last week’s low. The Emini has been trading around it all week. The bears want this week to close below it because last week was a sell signal bar. The chance of lower prices next week goes up if this week closes below last week’s low.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the open of the week. This week would then have a bull body and be a High 1 buy signal bar for next week. The open of the week is 40 points above yesterday’s close, which is far, but within reach.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 12 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up today. If it does, the gap will not be big. That increases the chance that the gap will close in the first hour or so.<p>Because yesterday reversed up from a wedge bull flag at support on the daily chart, traders expect a rally today. But after several sideways days, the odds are somewhat less than they would normally be after a wedge bull flag.<p>The bulls want a strong rally from the open and the bears want the gap up to lead to an immediate selloff. If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, then traders will expect a trend right from the open.<p>However, most days go sideways for the 1st hour or two. Then, the bulls look to buy a reversal up from a double bottom or wedge bottom, and the bears look to sell a rally to a double top or a wedge top.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-Low-2-bear-flag-then-cup-and-handle-and-head-and-shoulders-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-23.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 bear flag then cup and handle and head and shoulders bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

By going below yesterday’s low, the EURUSD triggered a sell signal overnight. However, it reversed up sharply.<p>The September 10 lower high is a magnet above. Traders expect the EURUSD to get there today or early next week. But as strong as the month-long rally has been, traders know that you have to look at all of the bars on the chart. Unless the rally breaks strongly above the September 1 high, the EURUSD is still in a 3-month trading range.<p>In a trading range, there are many strong legs up and down. But traders know that reversals are more likely than a successful breakout.<p>Consequently, next week will be important. Will the bulls be able to break above the September 1 top of the range? The odds favor a reversal down, but if the bulls get a couple closes above the September high, traders will look for the rally to continue to the February 2018 high around 1.25.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up strongly overnight from below yesterday’s low. It is now near yesterday’s high. The rally has been strong enough to continue to above yesterday’s high. Today would then be an outside up day on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>The overnight rally has been strong. Day traders have only been buying. However, the EURUSD is now just below yesterday’s high and the September 21 high, which are resistance. Also, there have been several small pullbacks in the past few hours.<p>The 5-minute chart might transition into a trading range around yesterday’s high. But day traders will not buy until there is a 20 to 30-pip pullback. At that point, they will also begin to sell reversals down from the top of the developing range.<p>Can the EURUSD continue up much higher today? Probably not. It raced up to resistance and it has been stalling. Also, the day’s range is already about as big as most recent days. It is therefore more likely that it will be sideways to up for the remainder of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal from wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

id=\"0-market-overview-weekend-market-analysis\">Market Overview: Weekend Market Analysis</h2><p>The<strong>SP500 Emini</strong>futures reversed up this week on the daily chart from a wedge bull flag reversal and a test of the September 16 top of a month-long trading range. It could rally for a couple weeks, but traders think it will probably reverse down again before breaking much above the all-time high.<p>The weekly<strong>Bond futures</strong>market has been selling off for 3 months on the weekly chart, but it is getting near the bottom of its 7-month trading range.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has had a weak rally for 4 weeks on the weekly chart. It will probably form a lower high soon and have a 2nd leg sideways to down.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-weekly-chart-working-down-to-bottom-of-7-month-range-\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart working down to bottom of 7-month range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-3-month-bear-leg-in-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-24.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has 3 month bear leg in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures have been trending down since early August. This week was a big bear bar closing near its low. Furthermore, this week closed below the low of a 4-month trading range. It is still in its 7-month trading range, but this week might be the start of a move down to the June low.<p>Next week is important. It is the follow-through bar and it help traders decide if this week’s breakout will lead to a measured move down or a reversal up. If next week is a big bull bar closing near its high, traders will conclude that the breakout failed. They will then look for a rally back to the middle of the 7-month trading range over the next few weeks.<p>But if next week is a 2nd consecutive big bear bar closing near its low, traders will see it as confirmation of this week’s breakout. That would increase the chance that there will be at least 2 legs down and that the selloff will test the June low.<h3 id=\"3-expect-unclear-follow-through-next-week\">Expect unclear follow-through next week</h3><p>What is most likely next week? Neither. The chart is in a trading range. Traders should expect disappointing follow-through. That means that a big bear bar is not as likely as traders might think.<p>Can it be a big bull bar? Probably not. Trading ranges usually do not create many strong buy or sell signal bars.<p>Next week might have a bull or bear body, but it will probably have a tail on the top or bottom to weaken the strength of the signal. It would then have something for everyone. Not too bearish, not too bullish.<p>Unless it is a bull bar closing in the upper half, traders will expect at least sideways to down trading over the next couple weeks. The more bullish the bar is, the more likely the bonds will go sideways to up. The more bearish, the more likely it will go sideways to down.<p>It probably will not collapse. However, I have been saying that the bull trend in bonds will probably not continue much longer. In addition, I have repeatedly said bonds will be lower 5 years from now and 10 years from now. Interest rates will not hit zero, as so many “experts” have predicted. That means the upside is limited. The bulls will be lucky if the bond market tests the March high.<h3 id=\"4-the-fed-is-lying\">The Fed is lying</h3><p>What about the Fed keeping rates low? Two thoughts. First, they only control short-term rates and not the bond market.<p>Second, they lie. The Fed has said that it will keep short-term rates as low as necessary to protect the economy, which means the stock market. But read its statement carefully. It is not absolute.<p>Everyone counting on the Fed will probably see the Fed change its policy sooner than when they said they would. If bonds sell off, long-term rates will go up. That means inflation. The Fed would be forced to raise rates if they were concerned that inflation was rising too fast.<p>That is more likely than not.<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200916a.htm\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Expect the Fed to raise rates sooner than what they have led the public to believe (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Expect the Fed to raise rates sooner than what they have led the public to believe</a>.<h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"6-eurusd-weekly-chart-will-probably-form-lower-high\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart will probably form lower high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-bull-leg-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-24-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has bull leg in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart rallied this week but barely got above last week’s high. The bulls hope that the summer rally is resuming. However, the bears see the 4-week rally as a pullback from a 1st leg down from a wedge top. They expect a 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>Last week pulled back after 2 strong bull weeks. It was therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for this week. But it had a bear body and its high was in the middle of a 3-month trading range. I said that this was a weak buy signal and that there might be more sellers than buyers above last week’s high. This week closed just above last week’s high. There may be more sellers here. Traders will find out next week. It next week rallies, the EURUSD will probably test the September high soon. If next week is a bear bar, then there were more sellers above last week’s high.<h3 id=\"7-trading-ranges-resist-breaking-out\">Trading ranges resist breaking out</h3><p>Where does this leave traders? Confused. And confusion is one of the hallmarks of a trading range. Therefore, traders believe that the 3-month trading range is still in effect.<p>While it is clearly possible that the bull trend is in fact resuming, it is more likely that the September 1 wedge top is still controlling the market. A wedge top is a buy climax. After a buy climax, traders usually expect a couple legs sideways to down.<p>So far, there has only been one leg down. Consequently, traders expect the 4-week rally to stall and for the EURUSD to have a 2nd leg sideways to down. It should begin within the next few weeks.<p>What happens if the rally breaks above the September high? If the bulls get 2 closes above that high, there will probably be a 400-pip measured move up to the February 2018 high at around 1.25.<p>But if the breakout reverses down within a couple weeks, that could still be the start of a 2nd leg sideways to down from the September 1, 2020 wedge top.<p>Sometimes a sideways pullback in a bull trend has a leg that goes above the high of the bull trend. Since a lower high is more common, that’s what traders expect. But if there is a breakout above the September high and it soon reverses down, the 2nd leg from the wedge would come from a higher high.<h2 id=\"8-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"9-monthly-emini-chart-has-ioi-breakout-mode-pattern\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has ioi Breakout Mode pattern</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-ioi-and-expanding-triangle-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has ioi and expanding triangle in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has an inside bar so far in October. This is after last month being an outside bar. This is an ioi (inside-outside-inside) setup, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. October is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for November.<p>There are 5 trading days remaining in October. October’s candlestick could look very different when the month ends.<p>If October closes on its high or breaks above the September high, traders will expect higher prices in November. If it closes near its low or breaks below the September low, November will probably trade lower.<h3 id=\"10-limited-up-or-down-for-next-couple-months\">Limited up or down for next couple months</h3><p>But what happens if October remains an inside bar and has either a small bull or bear body? Then, traders will see it as neutral. The chance of an upside breakout would be about the same as for a downside breakout.<p>Since the 5-month rally was extreme and therefore a buy climax, and it stalled at the top of the expanding triangle, traders believe that a rally from here would only last a month or two before reversing.<p>But a buy climax means strong bulls. Therefore, traders also believe that a selloff from here will only last a month or two.<p>If the Emini probably won’t go far up or down, it will go sideways. If it goes down, it could get back to the middle of the 3-years trading range. That would would be just below 2900.<h2 id=\"11-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-weak-high-1-buy-signal-and-there-is-resistance-at-the-september-high\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has weak High 1 buy signal and there is resistance at the September high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-sell-signal-bar-and-entry-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-24-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has weak sell signal bar and entry bar\"></a></figure><p>The S&amp;P500 Emini futures triggered a minor sell signal on the weekly chart this week. Last week reversed down from a lower high double top with the September 2 all-time high.<p>However, last week did not close on its low and was therefore a weak sell signal bar. Furthermore, it followed a strong 3-week rally. That made a major trend reversal unlikely.<p>I said that this week would probably trade below last week’s low to trigger the sell signal but the selloff should only last a week or two. That is still the case.<p>Even though this week was a bear bar, it is probably forming a bull flag which could last another week or so. Traders expect at least one more push up. But because this week had a bear body and there are consecutive bear bars, it is a weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for this week.<h3 id=\"12-weak-buy-and-sell-signals\">Weak buy and sell signals</h3><p>A weak sell signal last week, a weak buy signal this week… what’s going on? Traders expect a selloff, and it might retrace half of the 5-month rally. A 50% correction would be below 2900.<p>But the 3-week rally was strong and there is room to the all-time high. Therefore, traders think that the bulls will make one more attempt to break far above the all-time high. Attempt, not successful attempt.<p>Traders believe that if there is a rally, it will only last a week or two. The Emini is at the top of a 3-month trading range. It is more likely to reverse down than break strongly above. But there is no clear top yet and therefore the Emini might rally a little more before reversing down.<h2 id=\"13-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-turning-up-from-a-wedge-bull-flag-but-near-top-of-2-month-trading-range\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart turning up from a wedge bull flag but near top of 2-month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-is-reversing-up-from-wedge-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-24-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart wedge bull flag reversal\"></a></figure><p>Two weeks ago, the daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke strongly above the September 16/October 6 double top. It reversed down over the past 2 weeks. The Emini reversed up on Thursday from a 6-day micro wedge bull flag. The bulls want the bull trend that began on September 24 to resume.<p>I wrote last week that the selloff would probably end this week and that the Emini would test the October 12 lower high. I said that if it goes above that high and reverses down, there would be a wedge rally where the 1st leg up was the September 16 high and the 2nd was the October 12 high.<p>That reversal would also be a double top with the September 2 all-time high. A wedge rally to a double top is a strong sell setup. Since great reversal patterns are rare, if there is a reversal down in the next several weeks, the setup will probably not be particularly clear. Why? Because most trends, especially tops, begin with setups that are not perfect.<h3 id=\"14-is-the-past-2-weeks-the-start-of-a-bear-trend\">Is the past 2 weeks the start of a bear trend?</h3><p>The bears hope that the 2-week selloff is the start of a bear trend. They see the October rally as forming a lower high double top with the September all-time high. They want the selloff to continue down to below the September 24 low.<p>That is the neckline of the double top. A measured move down would be 2819.25. That is also about a 50% retracement of the 5-month rally, and it is a test of the June trading range, which is a possible Final Bull Flag.<p>While this is possible, the rally 2 weeks ago was especially strong. Therefore, it is more likely that the Emini will make one more attempt to break to a new high before a bear trend begins.<h3 id=\"15-how-likely-is-a-reversal-down\">How likely is a reversal down?</h3><p>The Emini is near the top of a 3-month trading range. There is a 60% chance of a reversal down to at least the middle of the range, before the Emini breaks far above the September high. Also, there is a 50% chance that the selloff will reach the September low within a couple months, which is the bottom of the range. Finally, there is a 40% chance of a strong break below the September low, which could reach the targets below 2900.<p>How is that possible when the Fed said it will print infinite money to protect the economy, which means the stock market? Well, read the “The Fed is Lying” section under bond futures above. Once people begin to realize it, they will sell.<p>Every tick provides new information. These numbers are based on what the Emini is doing as of this week’s close.<h2 id=\"16-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is a weak entry for the bulls. But it had a big tail below. It is therefore also a weak sell signal bar for the bears who want a micro double top with last Tuesday or Wednesday’s highs.<p>I have been saying that the Emini will probably trade down to the middle of the 3-year trading range before getting much above the September all-time high, but it might test that high first. Traders are deciding if the reversal down has begun.<p>Since the rally 3 weeks ago was strong and there was no strong sell signal bar at either the September or October highs, the odds favor at least a small leg up from here. However, whether or not the bulls get a rally, traders think it will not last more than a week or two.<p>If instead the Emini breaks strongly below last week’s low, which was the bottom of a wedge bull flag on the daily chart, traders will conclude that a swing down is underway. At the moment, traders are looking for a bounce to at least the October 10 lower high.<h3>Last week of October tends to be up</h3><p>Here is a calendar oddity. The Emini has a 90% chance of being higher on the close of November 5 than on the open of October 26. Why? Who knows? All I know is that I did lots of calendar testing long ago and this is something I observed.<p>I do not place trades based on calendar tendencies because I do not think traders can trade them profitably. Anything that is easy to discover will be quickly found by the computers and none would take the opposite side. Geese that lay golden eggs always get loved to death quickly by opportunistic algorithms. I view calendar tendencies like this as a form of entertainment and not a source of income.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 35 points in the Globex market. It will probably gap below Friday’s low. That will trigger the minor micro double top sell signal on the daily chart. But since Friday was a doji just above the 20-day EMA and at the bottom of a 5-day tight trading range, this is a weak sell setup. That reduces the chance that today will be a big bear day.<p>Whenever there is a big gap down, there is a 20% chance that the day will form a trend from the open. Because the gap was down, the odds of a bear trend are slightly greater.<p>However, there is an 80% chance of a trading range open. That means traders expect the 1st leg up or down to evolve into a trading range for an hour or two instead of growing into a trend. If there is a trading range open, the bulls will look to buy a reversal up from either a double bottom or a wedge bottom.<p>If there are early bull bars, day traders will not be eager to short far below the average price (the 20-bar EMA). However, they will sell if the Emini goes sideways to around the EMA and forms a double top or wedge top.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-26.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal from wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-and-micro-double-top-but-also-bull-flag-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-26-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top and micro double top but also bull flag in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been sideways for 4 days at the September 2018 high, which has been a magnet for 3 months. The bulls see the 4 days as a bull flag in the rally that began on September 25. However, for the bears, there is a double top with the September 21 high and a micro double top with Thursday’s high.<p>The chart is in the middle of a 3-month trading range. There is always both a credible buy and sell setup. Traders continue to look for reversals every few days. They buy low, sell high, and take quick profits. The result is that the trading range can continue a long time. With the US presidential election next week, there is an increased chance that the 4-day tight trading range at the September 2018 high might last all week.<p>If today closes near its low, it will be a bear inside day and a sell signal bar for tomorrow. But it would be forming in the middle of a tight trading range and just above the EMA. That is a weak sell setup.<p>If today closes on the high of the day, today will have a bull body. Today would form a micro double bottom with Thursday’s low and it would be a buy signal bar for a 3-day bull flag.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to the bottom third of the 4-day tight trading range and bounced. When the market is sideways, traders look to buy reversals up from the bottom 3rd. This is true even when the day has sold off all night.<p>The EURUSD bounced 20 pips over the past 2 hours. That is enough for day traders to begin to look to buy pullbacks in addition to selling. They have been selling all night, but now they will only sell pullbacks. With both bulls and bears looking to enter on pullbacks and to take small profits, the overnight bear trend is probably evolving into a trading range.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high. However, after a relentless selloff overnight, they will probably need the EURUSD to go sideways for at least a couple hours and form a double bottom before they can get a trend reversal.<p>At the moment, day traders will look to buy and sell for scalps for at least a couple hours and probably for the remainder of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax testing February high\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That is a weak entry for the bulls. But it had a big tail below. It is therefore also a weak sell signal bar for the bears who want a micro double top with last Tuesday or Wednesday’s highs.<p>I have been saying that the Emini will probably trade down to the middle of the 3-year trading range before getting much above the September all-time high, but it might test that high first. Traders are deciding if the reversal down has begun.<p>Since the rally 3 weeks ago was strong and there was no strong sell signal bar at either the September or October highs, the odds favor at least a small leg up from here. However, whether or not the bulls get a rally, traders think it will not last more than a week or two.<p>If instead the Emini breaks strongly below last week’s low, which was the bottom of a wedge bull flag on the daily chart, traders will conclude that a swing down is underway. At the moment, traders are looking for a bounce to at least the October 10 lower high.<h3>Last week of October tends to be up</h3><p>Here is a calendar oddity. The Emini has a 90% chance of being higher on the close of November 5 than on the open of October 26. Why? Who knows? All I know is that I did lots of calendar testing long ago and this is something I observed.<p>I do not place trades based on calendar tendencies because I do not think traders can trade them profitably. Anything that is easy to discover will be quickly found by the computers and none would take the opposite side. Geese that lay golden eggs always get loved to death quickly by opportunistic algorithms. I view calendar tendencies like this as a form of entertainment and not a source of income.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 35 points in the Globex market. It will probably gap below Friday’s low. That will trigger the minor micro double top sell signal on the daily chart. But since Friday was a doji just above the 20-day EMA and at the bottom of a 5-day tight trading range, this is a weak sell setup. That reduces the chance that today will be a big bear day.<p>Whenever there is a big gap down, there is a 20% chance that the day will form a trend from the open. Because the gap was down, the odds of a bear trend are slightly greater.<p>However, there is an 80% chance of a trading range open. That means traders expect the 1st leg up or down to evolve into a trading range for an hour or two instead of growing into a trend. If there is a trading range open, the bulls will look to buy a reversal up from either a double bottom or a wedge bottom.<p>If there are early bull bars, day traders will not be eager to short far below the average price (the 20-bar EMA). However, they will sell if the Emini goes sideways to around the EMA and forms a double top or wedge top.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-26.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal from wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-and-micro-double-top-but-also-bull-flag-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-26-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top and micro double top but also bull flag in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been sideways for 4 days at the September 2018 high, which has been a magnet for 3 months. The bulls see the 4 days as a bull flag in the rally that began on September 25. However, for the bears, there is a double top with the September 21 high and a micro double top with Thursday’s high.<p>The chart is in the middle of a 3-month trading range. There is always both a credible buy and sell setup. Traders continue to look for reversals every few days. They buy low, sell high, and take quick profits. The result is that the trading range can continue a long time. With the US presidential election next week, there is an increased chance that the 4-day tight trading range at the September 2018 high might last all week.<p>If today closes near its low, it will be a bear inside day and a sell signal bar for tomorrow. But it would be forming in the middle of a tight trading range and just above the EMA. That is a weak sell setup.<p>If today closes on the high of the day, today will have a bull body. Today would form a micro double bottom with Thursday’s low and it would be a buy signal bar for a 3-day bull flag.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to the bottom third of the 4-day tight trading range and bounced. When the market is sideways, traders look to buy reversals up from the bottom 3rd. This is true even when the day has sold off all night.<p>The EURUSD bounced 20 pips over the past 2 hours. That is enough for day traders to begin to look to buy pullbacks in addition to selling. They have been selling all night, but now they will only sell pullbacks. With both bulls and bears looking to enter on pullbacks and to take small profits, the overnight bear trend is probably evolving into a trading range.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high. However, after a relentless selloff overnight, they will probably need the EURUSD to go sideways for at least a couple hours and form a double bottom before they can get a trend reversal.<p>At the moment, day traders will look to buy and sell for scalps for at least a couple hours and probably for the remainder of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax testing February high\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The day closed just above the midpoint of the range, and therefore the bulls won the day. That reduces the chance of a big bear day today.<p>The month closes on Friday. If the month has even a small bear body, there will be an increased chance of lower prices in November. The bulls obviously do not want this, and they therefore will try to get the month to close above the open of the month.<p>Yesterday collapsed for the first half of the day, but spent half of the day around the open of the month. That tells traders that the open of the month could be important all week. It therefore increases the chances of sideways trading this week.<p>Yesterday broke below a small wedge bull flag on the daily chart. Today is the follow-through day. The more bearish today is, the more likely the Emini will begin a swing down.<p>If today instead is a bull day closing near its high, traders will suspect that the bear breakout failed. They then will look for a reversal up to the October 12 lower high.<p>What is most likely? As I said, the Emini spent a lot of time around the open of the month yesterday. That increases the chance of a sideways day today. Since yesterday’s range was big, today could be an inside day.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 9 points in the Globex session. As strong as yesterday’s selloff was, the 5-minute chart was in a trading range for the final 5 hours. It broke above the top of the range in the final hour. The bulls are hoping that the breakout will lead to a measured move up today. That would be near the 20-bar EMA on the 60-minute chart and yesterday’s high.<p>The day after a sell climax usually has a lot of trading range trading. Traders decide if the selloff was just a sell vacuum test of support (here, the open of the month) or the start of a bear trend.<p>With yesterday closing in the middle, traders are neutral. That increases the chance of a trading range day today. There will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down. The open of the month and yesterday’s low are magnets below, and the EMA on the 60-minute chart and yesterday’s high are magnets above.<p>With yesterday’s range being big, even if today is a trading range day, the legs will be big enough to swing trade. While a trend day is less likely, if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, traders will swing trade. But they know that the trend will probably only be a strong leg in what will likely be a trading range day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-sell-climax-testing-February-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-27.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax testing February high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It has pulled back for 4 days. This is a bull flag. The September 10 major lower high and the September 1 trading range high are magnets above. Traders expect the EURUSD to go at least a little higher over the next week.<p>The bears have a double top lower high major trend reversal with the September 21 high. But, the EURUSD is not going down. It will probably go at least a little higher, and the bears will again try to get a reversal down from a double top with either the September 10 lower high or the September 1 high.<p>The chart has been in a trading range for 4 months. There have been many strong legs up and down. Traders know that trading ranges resist breaking out. They therefore expect reversals, even though one leg will eventually break out. This 4-week rally will probably go a little more sideways to up, but as relentless as it has been, it probably will fail to continue to much above the September high.<p>There have been 2 sell signal bars over the past 3 days, but they have failed to lead to a selloff. When a market tries to do something a couple times and fails, it usually then tries the opposite. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices before a bear leg begins.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight rallied, sold off sharply to below yesterday’s low, and then reversed up strongly again overnight. This is the 5th day in a tight trading range. The selloff and reversal up were abrupt. This makes it likely that the EURUSD will be sideways to up for the remainder of the session.<p>Yesterday was a sell signal bar on the daily chart. The selloff broke below yesterday’s low and triggered the sell signal. But the bulls aggressively bought it.<p>The rally is strong enough so that the EURUSD might continue up to above yesterday’s high. Today would then be an outside up day. That would increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow.<p>Day traders have only been buying since the overnight reversal up from the sell climax. They will probably mostly buy for the rest of the day.<p>But if the bears get a 20-pip pullback, the rally might transition into a trading range. At that point, day traders will also look to sell reversals down from 10-pip scalps.<p>Can today continue much higher? It is in the middle of a 5-day tight trading range. That is a magnet and it will probably limit how much higher the rally can go. The bulls would like it to continue up 25 more pips to above yesterday’s high. If they succeed, it will probably not get much above that high because the EURUSD would then be at the top of the 5-day range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It stayed between the support of the open of the month and the resistance of the EMA on the 60 minute chart. Traders still need more information before they decide if yesterday’s bear breakout will lead to a test down to the September low. The alternative is for the Emini to reverse up and test the October 12 lower and and possibly the all-time high.<p>Because today had a bear body, it is a sell signal bar for tomorrow. The bears see it as confirmation of yesterday’s bear breakout. It slightly increases the chance of lower prices. But unless the bears get more follow-through selling over the couple days, the odds will be back 50-50.<p>The Emini might wait until after the election a week from today before deciding on its direction. For the remainder of the month, the open of the month is the most important price. The month closes on Friday. The bulls want a bull body and the bears want a bear body on this months candlestick.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders decide if the selloff was just a sell vacuum test of support (here, the open of the month) or the start of a bear trend.<p>With yesterday closing in the middle, traders are neutral. That increases the chance of a trading range day today. There will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down. The open of the month and yesterday’s low are magnets below, and the EMA on the 60-minute chart and yesterday’s high are magnets above.<p>With yesterday’s range being big, even if today is a trading range day, the legs will be big enough to swing trade. While a trend day is less likely, if there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, traders will swing trade. But they know that the trend will probably only be a strong leg in what will likely be a trading range day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-sell-climax-testing-February-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-27.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax testing February high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It has pulled back for 4 days. This is a bull flag. The September 10 major lower high and the September 1 trading range high are magnets above. Traders expect the EURUSD to go at least a little higher over the next week.<p>The bears have a double top lower high major trend reversal with the September 21 high. But, the EURUSD is not going down. It will probably go at least a little higher, and the bears will again try to get a reversal down from a double top with either the September 10 lower high or the September 1 high.<p>The chart has been in a trading range for 4 months. There have been many strong legs up and down. Traders know that trading ranges resist breaking out. They therefore expect reversals, even though one leg will eventually break out. This 4-week rally will probably go a little more sideways to up, but as relentless as it has been, it probably will fail to continue to much above the September high.<p>There have been 2 sell signal bars over the past 3 days, but they have failed to lead to a selloff. When a market tries to do something a couple times and fails, it usually then tries the opposite. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices before a bear leg begins.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight rallied, sold off sharply to below yesterday’s low, and then reversed up strongly again overnight. This is the 5th day in a tight trading range. The selloff and reversal up were abrupt. This makes it likely that the EURUSD will be sideways to up for the remainder of the session.<p>Yesterday was a sell signal bar on the daily chart. The selloff broke below yesterday’s low and triggered the sell signal. But the bulls aggressively bought it.<p>The rally is strong enough so that the EURUSD might continue up to above yesterday’s high. Today would then be an outside up day. That would increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow.<p>Day traders have only been buying since the overnight reversal up from the sell climax. They will probably mostly buy for the rest of the day.<p>But if the bears get a 20-pip pullback, the rally might transition into a trading range. At that point, day traders will also look to sell reversals down from 10-pip scalps.<p>Can today continue much higher? It is in the middle of a 5-day tight trading range. That is a magnet and it will probably limit how much higher the rally can go. The bulls would like it to continue up 25 more pips to above yesterday’s high. If they succeed, it will probably not get much above that high because the EURUSD would then be at the top of the 5-day range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It stayed between the support of the open of the month and the resistance of the EMA on the 60 minute chart. Traders still need more information before they decide if yesterday’s bear breakout will lead to a test down to the September low. The alternative is for the Emini to reverse up and test the October 12 lower and and possibly the all-time high.<p>Because today had a bear body, it is a sell signal bar for tomorrow. The bears see it as confirmation of yesterday’s bear breakout. It slightly increases the chance of lower prices. But unless the bears get more follow-through selling over the couple days, the odds will be back 50-50.<p>The Emini might wait until after the election a week from today before deciding on its direction. For the remainder of the month, the open of the month is the most important price. The month closes on Friday. The bulls want a bull body and the bears want a bear body on this months candlestick.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It fell below the open of the month and the February high. But it reversed up and closed above both support levels. Also, it closed just above the midpoint of the day’s range, which makes the bear breakout less certain.<p>Yesterday was a bear bar on the daily chart. Traders see that as Emini follow-through selling and confirmation of Monday’s bear breakout. It increases the chance of at least slightly lower prices today. Today will probably open with a big gap down. If today is another bear day, the Emini will probably work down to the September low over the next few weeks.<p>Because yesterday was an inside day on the daily chart and it had a bear body, it is a Low 1 sell signal bar for today. The bears want a measured move down to the September low, and the bulls want the September rally to resume up to the all-time high.<h3>This is all about the monthly chart</h3><p>This week’s selloff has been all about the monthly chart. There are 3 trading days left in October (Friday is the final trading day). October is an inside bar on the monthly chart. If it ends up with a bear body, it will increase the chance of lower prices in November.<p>The open of the month might remain an important magnet for the rest of the month. But the bulls will need a reversal up today. Otherwise, the Emini will be too far below the open for it to get back above the open by Friday’s close.<p>If the Emini is within 20 points of the open of the month in the final hour on Friday, the Emini will probably get drawn to it. Then, in the final minutes of trading for the month, either close a little above or below the open of the month.<p>While the odds of lower prices are increasing, the bulls still have a chance of reversing the bear breakout. But they need to start forming bull bars.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 65 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open with a big gap down. A big gap increases the chance of a trend day. A bear trend is slightly more likely.<p>But the Emini will open far below the 20-bar EMA on the 5-minute chart, which is a measure of the average price. Day traders do not like to sell far below the average price unless the selling is far above average. They would need to see a couple consecutive big bear bars in the 1st 30 minutes before they will sell. The bulls want to see a couple big bull bars before buying and betting on a bull trend.<p>When there is a big gap down, there is only a 20% chance of a big trend up or down on the open. There is an 80% chance that the 1st leg up or down will lead to a trading range. The bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom for a swing up. The bears want a double top or wedge top near the EMA before selling for a swing down.<p>Also, if there is a trading range open and then a trend, the trend usually will not last all day. It typically either evolves into a trading range for at least a couple hours or has at least a small reversal late in the day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-28.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day and Emini follow-through selling\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If today closes on its low, the EURUSD should fall at least to the October 15 low. The bulls will try to form a double bottom with that low or with the September 25 low.<p>I said last week at the top of the rally that reversals were more likely than breakouts. That is true on the way down as well. But if today remains a big bear day, it will probably be the start of a selloff that will last at least another week.<p>Also, it should have at least a 2nd leg down. Legs in trading ranges often have 2 legs, like the rally to the September 1 high, the selloff to the September 25 low, and the rally to the October 21 high.<p>The weekly chart is important. Despite the 3-month trading range, there was a 4-month wedge top. Today could be the start of a 2nd leg down from that wedge top. If it is, the 1st target is the March 9 high, which was the breakout point for the summer rally.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has sold off in a Small Pullback Bear Trend overnight. That is a strong bear trend. Day traders have only been selling.<p>However, the day’s range is big and the selloff is beginning to have a wedge shape. That typically will attract profit takers. If so, the bear trend will begin to transition into a trading range for at least a couple hours.<p>But until there is at least a 20-pip bounce, day traders will only sell. Once there is a 20-pip bounce, day traders will also begin to buy reversals up from 10 to 20-pip scalps.<p>The bulls want a trend reversal up. They will probably not get one today. If they do, they will have to stop the selling and enter a trading range for at least a couple hours first.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That increases the chance of another gap down tomorrow.<p>Because today was a sell climax day, there is an increased chance of sideways trading tomorrow. The 4 day selloff has been strong enough for traders to look for at least a small 2nd leg down. Therefore, traders will sell the 1st one to two day bounce.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It closed the gap above the September 25 high. The next target below is the September low, which is the bottom of the 3 month trading range and the neckline of the double top.<p>I have been saying for months that the Emini would probably have to test the middle of its 5-month rally before it could go much higher. This late October collapse might be the start of a test down to below 3000.<p>Because yesterday was climactic, there is an increased chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading today. If the bulls get a 1 – 2-day rally, the bears will sell it, looking for at least a small 2nd leg sideways down after the surprisingly strong 3-day selloff.<h3>This is all about the monthly chart</h3><p>There are only 2 trading days left in October. October so far on the monthly chart is a bear inside bar after a bear outside bar. This is an ioi sell signal. If October remains an inside bar, November will probably trade below the October low to trigger the sell.<p>It is important to remember that the Emini is still in a 3-month trading range. This selloff might simply be a test of the bottom of the range. Yesterday’s low could simply be a measured move down from the October 12 high to the October 22 low, which was the bottom of a wedge bull flag.<p>It is important to note that the bulls have been strong for 7 months. They will try to prevent October from closing on its low. The open of the month is 100 points above yesterday’s close. That is probably too far for the bulls to get there by tomorrow’s close. But if they can get halfway there, October will be less bearish on the monthly chart. The 3-month trading range could then grow into a triangle over the next month.<p>However, the odds still favor lower prices over the next month or two because of the ioi in a buy climax at resistance on the monthly chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex session. If it opens here, it will be in yesterday’s 5-hour trading range That would increase the chances of sideways to up trading today.<p>Also, after extreme selling for several days down to a measured move target, many bears will start to take profits. That would also increase the chance of sideways to up trading.<p>There is a small chance that this selloff is the start of a collapse, like in February. If today is another big bear day, especially if it breaks below the September low, the odds of a bear trend on the daily chart will increase.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-29.png\" alt=\"Emini collapsing bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-and-possible-double-bottom-un-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-29-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top and possible double bottom un trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has sold off for 4 days. The bears hope this is the resumption of the bear trend that began with the September 1 high.<p>However, trading ranges have lots of strong legs up and down, and each is more likely to reverse than lead to a trend. That is true here. The bulls want a double bottom with the October 15 low. After 4 bear days, they will probably need at least a micro double bottom before they can get a leg up. That means traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>This is the 4th test of 1.17, and the September 25 low is a magnet below. Even if the EURUSD bounces for a day or two, traders expect a break below 1.17 and a test of the September low just above 1.16. The bulls will try to get a reversal up there, at the bottom of the range.<p>If the bears get a couple closes below1.17, the EURUSD will probably fall to 1.16. If they get a couple closes below the September low, the EURUSD will probably test down to the breakout point on the weekly chart at the March 9 high, just below 1.15.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off again last night down to 1.17, which it tested 3 other times in the past 5 weeks. Since it has been support, it might stall here today.<p>The overnight selloff was a Bear Spike and Parabolic Wedge Bear Channel. That is a sell climax pattern and it usually transitions into a trading range. The top of the range is typically around the start of the parabolic bear channel, which is above 1.1730.<p>But the bear channel has been tight. Day traders have only been selling. The bulls need the market to stop going down and start going sideways. If it does, day traders will start to buy for 10-pip scalps. If there is a trading range with a good buy signal bar, day traders will be willing to hold part of their position for a possible test of 1.1740.<p>The bears want the overnight bear trend to continue to far below 1.17. Because the overnight selloff is in a sell climax pattern, it is more likely that it will evolve into a trading range.<h3>If it enters a trading range, it will be in Breakout Mode</h3><p>But if it does enter a trading range, it will be in Breakout Mode. Yes, the bulls will want a trend reversal up from support. But the bears see the trading range as a bear flag. They hope that the bear trend will resume and break far below 1.17 today.<p>Since the day’s range is already about average and the 4-day selloff is extreme and at support, today will probably enter a trading range for the rest of the day. The bears will try to get today to close below the October 15 low of 1.1689. That would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow.<p>However, the bulls want today to close 20 to 30 pips above the day’s low. That would make the bears take some profits and increase the chance of sideways to up trading tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-outside-up-and-bull-trend-resumption-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up and bull trend resumption day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was therefore an outside up day.<p>Today is now a buy signal bar on the daily chart. But with the close back down in the middle of the range, today is a weak buy signal bar. After 4 days down, the Emini will probably bounce for a day or two. If it gaps up tomorrow, there would be a 2-day island bottom, which is a minor buy signal.<p>The bulls, however, hope that the bull trend is resuming. At a minimum, they want the month to have a bull body on the monthly chart. That would increase the chance of sideways to up trading in November and reduce the chance of much lower prices in November. Remember, tomorrow is the final trading day in October.<p>The bears want the month to close on its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices in November, but that probably will not happen after today’s strong reversal up.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday was therefore an outside up day near the bottom of its 3-month range. It is a minor buy signal bar for today. But because it had a big tail on top, it is a weak buy setup. This makes sideways more likely than a big bull day.<p>Even if the bulls get a rally today, it would be coming after a strong 4-day selloff. The bears will probably sell a 1 to 2-day bounce.<h3>Final trading day of the month</h3><p>This week has been all about the monthly chart. Today is the last trading day of the month. October is an inside bar on the monthly chart, and it followed an outside bar in September. There is now an ioi Breakout Mode pattern.<p>The bulls want a big bull day today so that the month closes above the open. There would then be a bull body for October. That would increase the chance that November might trade above the October high. But with the Emini down 30 points in the Globex session, the open of the month is 100 points higher. Today will probably not get there. October should end up with a bear body.<p>Since the ioi is forming at the top of a 3-year trading range, the odds are slightly greater for a reversal down than a resumption up. The more bearish October is, the more likely November will trade below the October.<p>But even if the Emini does trade down, the best the bears will probably get is a 1 to 2-month pullback to the middle of the yearlong range. This is not a major top formation, given how strong the summer rally was.<h3>What about the US election?</h3><p>Who cares? The president is not important when it comes to the stock market. Conventional wisdom is that republicans are better. But look at the huge rallies during Clinton and Obama and compare them to the sideways trading under Bush and Trump. It’s the Fed, not the president.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 31 points in the Globex session. But it will still open within yesterday’s range. Yesterday was a big outside day. The day after a big outside day tends to be a 3rd mostly sideways day. There should therefore be buyers around yesterday’s low. That includes below yesterday’s low, if today breaks below it. But there will also be sellers around yesterday’s high, which is now the top of a 2-day trading range.<p>While today is likely to mostly overlap yesterday, yesterday was huge. Therefore, the legs up and down today should be big enough for swing trading. But because of the increased chance of a trading range day, traders should look for reversals after every 1 to 3-hour leg up or down.<p>Any day can become a trend day. Therefore, a leg up or down can last all day. As I said, the legs should be big enough for swing trades. If a swing lasts all day, day traders will swing trade in that direction all day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-outside-up-and-bull-trend-resumption-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-30.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up and bull trend resumption day.

But yesterday was a big day, which usually will attract some profit-taking. Also, the EURUSD is now just above the bottom of a 3-month trading range, which is support. Finally, today is the last day of the month. The month so far is a bear inside month after an inside down month in September. The bulls will try hard to keep the low above the September low.<p>All of these factors reduce the chance of another big bear day today. But after 4 bear days, today will probably not be a big bull day either. That means it should be more of a trading range day.<p>Yesterday broke below the October 15 higher low. Traders are deciding if the breakout will be successful and continue down to the next support, which is the September 25 low. The odds will go up if today closes below the October 15 low and if the day has a bear body. Therefore, all that the bears need today is a small, sideways day. They do not need a big bear day.<p>The bulls do not need much either. They want today to close above the open, which would create a bull body on the daily chart. That would be bad follow-through after yesterday’s breakout and reduce the chances of the selloff growing into a bear trend. Additionally, they would like today to close back above the October 25 low, which is only 17 pips above the current price.<p>With neither the bulls nor the bears needing a big move from here, there is a reduced incentive for a big move. Also, the day after a sell climax day usually is smaller and sideways.<p>While all of these factors make a small, trading range day likely, traders will be quick to switch to swing trading if the day begins to trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways in a 25-pip range overnight. It is at the open of the day and at yesterday’s close and just below the October 15 low.<p>So far, day traders have only been scalping. Because of what I wrote above, they expect today to remain a trading range day. But if there are several big trend bars up or down, they will switch to swing trading.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-bear-trend-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

October is therefore an inside bar on the monthly chart.

The monthly chart is reversing down from the top of its 3-year trading range for the 2nd time in 3 months.

Yesterday was therefore an outside up day near the bottom of its 3-month range. It is a minor buy signal bar for today. But because it had a big tail on top, it is a weak buy setup. This makes sideways more likely than a big bull day.<p>Even if the bulls get a rally today, it would be coming after a strong 4-day selloff. The bears will probably sell a 1 to 2-day bounce.<h3>Final trading day of the month</h3><p>This week has been all about the monthly chart. Today is the last trading day of the month. October is an inside bar on the monthly chart, and it followed an outside bar in September. There is now an ioi Breakout Mode pattern.<p>The bulls want a big bull day today so that the month closes above the open. There would then be a bull body for October. That would increase the chance that November might trade above the October high. But with the Emini down 30 points in the Globex session, the open of the month is 100 points higher. Today will probably not get there. October should end up with a bear body.<p>Since the ioi is forming at the top of a 3-year trading range, the odds are slightly greater for a reversal down than a resumption up. The more bearish October is, the more likely November will trade below the October.<p>But even if the Emini does trade down, the best the bears will probably get is a 1 to 2-month pullback to the middle of the yearlong range. This is not a major top formation, given how strong the summer rally was.<h3>What about the US election?</h3><p>Who cares? The president is not important when it comes to the stock market. Conventional wisdom is that republicans are better. But look at the huge rallies during Clinton and Obama and compare them to the sideways trading under Bush and Trump. It’s the Fed, not the president.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 31 points in the Globex session. But it will still open within yesterday’s range. Yesterday was a big outside day. The day after a big outside day tends to be a 3rd mostly sideways day. There should therefore be buyers around yesterday’s low. That includes below yesterday’s low, if today breaks below it. But there will also be sellers around yesterday’s high, which is now the top of a 2-day trading range.<p>While today is likely to mostly overlap yesterday, yesterday was huge. Therefore, the legs up and down today should be big enough for swing trading. But because of the increased chance of a trading range day, traders should look for reversals after every 1 to 3-hour leg up or down.<p>Any day can become a trend day. Therefore, a leg up or down can last all day. As I said, the legs should be big enough for swing trades. If a swing lasts all day, day traders will swing trade in that direction all day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-outside-up-and-bull-trend-resumption-day-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-30.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up and bull trend resumption day.

parabolic wedge buy signal on the daily chart. The Emini should bounce next week, but it also should fall below the October low at some point in November.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are turning down from a lower high after an extreme buy climax on the monthly chart. They should trade at least a little lower next week. But because they are near the June low at the bottom of a 7-month trading range, they might turn up for a few weeks soon. It’s a trading range. Nobody expects much.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has an ioi sell signal on the monthly chart and a wedge top on the weekly chart. The selloff should continue to at least the March 9 high, which was the breakout point of the summer rally.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-monthly-chart-is-turning-down-from-lower-high\">Bond futures<em><strong>monthly</strong></em><strong>chart</strong>is turning down from lower high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-is-turning-down-from-lower-high-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-31.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart is turning down from lower high after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The monthly bond futures chart has gone sideways for 7 months after a reversal down in March from the most extreme buy climax in history. Since March, I have been saying that the most likely thing to happen would be that the monthly chart would enter a tight trading range and that it could last a year or more.<p>While the monthly bonds have traded down for 3 months, they are still in the 7-month tight trading range. Furthermore, there have not been consecutive strong trend bars up or down since March. In fact, there have not been even consecutive weak trend bars in the same direction.<p>There is no sustained buying or selling. Traders continue to look for the market to trade down for a few weeks and then up for a few weeks. Traders need more information before they will be willing to hold for a trend.<p>Consecutive closes far above or below the trading range would convince many traders that a trend has begun. That can happen at any point, but there is currently no evidence that it is about to happen. In the meantime, traders will continue to bet on reversals and take quick profits.<h3 id=\"3-trading-range-is-breakout-mode\">Trading range is Breakout Mode</h3><p>Every trading range eventually breaks into a trend. The trend can be up or down.<p>Every trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. There are always both reasonable buy and sell setups.<p>The bulls look at the chart and see a bull flag. They expect the bull trend to resume before too long. On a fundamental basis, they are concerned about the world’s economy, especially in light of the pandemic.<a aria-label=\"That makes them think that interest rates at some point will go negative.

Bonds will be lower 5 and 10 years from now. But what is the path? They could test to above the March high before there is a clear bear trend. It’s like you taking an airport shuttle from a hotel in Times Square to JFK. You know that you will get there, but you might go in the opposite direction one or more times as the bus picks up additional passengers at other hotels. But you will end up at JFK. And bonds will go down.<h2 id=\"4-eurusd-forex-market-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market</strong></h2><h2 id=\"5-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-an-ioi-sell-signal\">EURUSD<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart has an ioi sell signal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-ioi-breakout-mode-and-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-31-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has ioi breakout mode and double top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the monthly chart was in a bear trend from February 2018 to March 2020. There was a 2-month spike down (bear trend reversal) in April and May 2018 and then a 2-year bear channel.<p>The September 2018 high was the 1st pullback from the spike down and it was therefore the start of the bear channel. For the past year, I have been saying that there eventually would be a rally back to that September high, and that the monthly chart would then transition into a trading range. Furthermore, I said that the trading range could last for many months or even more than a year.<p>The EURUSD rallied strongly for 4 months this summer and stopped exactly at the September 2018 high, which was likely. It has now gone sideways for 3 months, oscillating around that major resistance. This is probably the start of the developing trading range, and this area should be the top of the range.<h3 id=\"6-ioi-breakout-mode-pattern\">ioi Breakout Mode pattern</h3><p>Last month, September, was an outside down month. October was an inside month. This is therefore an ioi pattern (inside-outside-inside) on the monthly chart. This is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>The bulls see October as a High 1 bull flag, which is a pullback in a bull trend. They want the summer rally to resume.<p>But the bears see October as a second sell signal bar at resistance. A 2nd reversal down from the top of a trading range is a higher probability setup.<p>August was the 1st sell signal bar, but it was the 4th consecutive bull bar. I said in August that there would be buyers below the August low. But I also said that the rally would only last a month or two before the bears would try again. The bears expect the EURUSD to turn down from the top of its developing trading range, and stay between 1.06 to 1.20 for at least several more months.<p>While a Breakout Mode pattern is generally a 50 – 50 bet, the bears have a slight edge here. This is because the EURUSD monthly chart is so far following the typical Spike and Bear Channel sequence. That makes it likely to continue to follow it. It should turn down from the September 2018 high and go sideways for many months.<h2 id=\"7-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-turning-down-from-a-lower-high-after-a-wedge-top\">EURUSD<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart is turning down from a lower high after a wedge top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-lower-high-after-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-31-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has lower high after wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>I am writing mostly about the monthly chart this week. However, I want to show the wedge rally on the weekly chart and how it stopped at the September 2018 resistance.<p>I have been saying that there should be a couple legs down to at least the breakout point of the summer rally. That is the March high, just below 1.15. The reversal might continue down to the June low, which was the start of the final leg up in the wedge.<h2 id=\"8-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"9-yearly-sampp-cash-index-chart-is-an-outside-bar-and-a-doji\"><em><strong>Yearly</strong></em>S&amp;P cash index chart is an outside bar and a doji</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SP-cash-index-yearly-candlestick-chart-has-a-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-an-outside-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-31-3.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P cash index yearly candlestick chart has a parabolic wedge buy climax and an outside bar\"></a></figure><p>I last showed the yearly S&amp;P500 cash index chart in early January. At that time, I said that 2020 would probably not be a big bull bar because 2019 was a very big bar and it was late in a bull trend. That is usually an exhaustive buy climax. Also, there is a parabolic wedge buy climax on the yearly chart, which is another exhaustion pattern. Markets tend to stall when they become exhausted.<p>Big bars late in a bull trend typically attract profit-takers. That is why I wrote at the end of last year that 2020 would probably be sideways. Did I know it would go below the 2019 low and above the 2019 high and form an outside bar? No, but I thought that was possible.<p>Look at this year’s candlestick and what do you see? There are 2 months left to the year and it could look very different at the end of the year. But so far, 2020 is a huge bar with the current close near the open of the year. It is therefore just a big doji bar, which is a 1-bar trading range. That makes sense because the S&amp;P cash index and the Emini are clearly in trading ranges on the weekly chart.<h3 id=\"10-magnets-are-important-just-before-a-bar-closes\">Magnets are important just before a bar closes</h3><p>When a bar is about to close, traders pay attention to magnets, which are nearby support and resistance levels. On the yearly chart, some magnets are the highs and lows of the bar before, and of the current bar. Another is the close of bar before, which is the close of 2019. Will 2020 close above the close of last year, which would make 2020 an up year?<p>This chart is the cash index, but the Emini is the futures market equivalent and it is very similar. It only goes back to 1997 and that is why I am showing the chart of the cash index.<h3 id=\"11-what-is-the-most-important-price-for-the-remainder-of-2020\">What is the most important price for the remainder of 2020?</h3><p>It is unlikely that the Emini will close at the low of the year. But there is one other magnet that might be the most important: the open of the year. If 2020 closed very near the open, the year would be a perfect doji bar, which is neutral.<p>The year opened at 3214.50. Since that is only 50 points below the current price, it certainly is within reach over the next two months. Of all of the possible yearly magnets, that is probably the most important.<p>If the Emini is within 100 points of that price in the final week of the year, it will probably get drawn to it. If the year closes within 50 points or so of the open of the year, 2020 would then remain a doji bar. That would increase the chance of more sideways trading in 2021.<p>Finally, when there is an outside bar late in a bull trend at the top of a buy climax, the next bar typically will not go far above it, if it goes above it at all. Therefore, 2021 will probably not be a strong year.<p>More likely, it will be sideways and maybe down. It would then be the 4th year in a trading range. Also, the bar after a huge outside bar often is an inside bar. If that happens here, then 2021 would not trade below this year’s low or above this year’s high.<h3 id=\"12-3-year-trading-range-might-continue-for-a-decade\">3-year trading range might continue for a decade</h3><p>Remember, since 2017, I have been saying that the Emini would probably be sideways for about a decade. This is because the 10-year rally was extreme and it takes about a decade for the fundamentals to catch up to the price.<p>Look back at the strong rallies in 1960’s and the 1990’s. Both led to a decade of sideways trading, and both trading ranges had at least a couple pullbacks of 40 to 70%.<h2 id=\"13-monthly-emini-chart-has-ioi-sell-signal\"><strong><em>Monthly</em></strong>Emini chart has ioi sell signal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-ioi-sell-signal-at-top-of-expanding-triangle-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-31-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P futures monthly candlestick chart has ioi sell signal at top of expanding triangle\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed an inside bar in October. At the end of September, I said that this was a good possibility. It followed an outside bar in September. There is now an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern on the monthly chart. This is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Generally, a Breakout Mode pattern has about the same chance of a bull or bear breakout. Here, the momentum up since March has been strong. That normally would favor a bull breakout. The bulls see October as a pullback in a strong bull trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>But this ioi has consecutive bear bars. That increases the chance of a break below the October low, which would trigger the monthly sell signal.<p>Also, this is the 2nd reversal down in 3 months. October is therefore a Low 2 Top sell signal. A 2nd signal has a higher probability of leading to a reversal down.<p>Finally, there is a 3-year Expanding Triangle top, and the Emini is at the top of a 10-year bull channel. This is a resistance area, and the 5-month rally was extreme and therefore climactic. These factors make a reversal down below the October low more likely than November breaking above the October high.<p>But a buy climax is also a sign of strong bulls. Traders should expect the bulls to return after a 1 to 2-month pullback. That pullback might reach the middle of the 3-year trading range, which is around 2900.<h2 id=\"14-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-is-turning-down-from-a-double-top\"><strong><em>Weekly</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is turning down from a double top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-lower-high-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-31-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P futures weekly candlestick chart has lower high double top \"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has sold off for 3 weeks from a double top with the September all-time high. Traders are wondering if the selloff will break below the September 24 neckline of the double top. Alternatively, the bulls expect a reversal up from a double bottom with that low.<p>Everyone knows that there will eventually be a breakout, but in which direction? Trading ranges resist breaking out. The legs up and down are often strong, as these have been, yet reversals are more likely than breakouts.<h3 id=\"15-breakouts-need-consecutive-closes\">Breakouts need consecutive closes</h3><p>If the bears get a couple consecutive closes below the September 24 neckline of the double top, they will look for a measured move down. That would be below 2900, and it would also be around a 50% retracement of this year’s rally.<p>The bulls want a breakout above the 3-month trading range. They will then look for a 400-point measured move up to 4,000. If they get consecutive closes above the September all-time high, traders will expect higher prices.<p>Which is more likely, up or down? It really is close to a 50-50 bet. However, the Expanding Triangle top and the resistance of the top of the 10 year bull channel make a bear breakout more likely.<p>Would I be surprised by a bull breakout? How could I be? The bulls have at least a 40% chance of a test of the top of the range and a breakout. If they succeed, no one should be surprised.<h2 id=\"16-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-possible-double-bottom\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has parabolic wedge sell climax and possible double bottom</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Emini-SP-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-double-top-and-double-bottom-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-10-31-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P futures daily candlestick chart has double top and double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has sold off strongly for 3 weeks. The bears want a strong breakout below the September 25 low. That is the neckline of the double top. They then want a 400-point measured move down to the middle of the 3-year trading range.<p>A major trend reversal like this has a 40% chance of leading to about a measured move down. But, there is currently a 60% chance that the Emini will fall at least a little below the September 25 low.<p>One tick below that low is also the theoretical stop for the bulls who see the 3-week selloff as just a deep pullback from the early October rally. In general, when an obvious stop gets hit, there is a 50% chance that the breakout will continue down and a 50% chance that it will soon reverse up.<p>The bear trend is more likely to continue if there are consecutive bear bars closing below the breakout point, and if the bars are big and they close near their lows. The less a breakout looks like that, the more likely it will fail. For example, if there is a big bull bar closing on its high just after the breakout, traders will assume that the breakout is failing.<h3 id=\"17-there-is-always-a-bull-case\">There is always a bull case</h3><p>What happens if there is no bear breakout? The bulls see the 3-week selloff as a parabolic wedge test of the bottom of a 3-month trading range. They expect a higher low double bottom with the September 25 low.<p>Because Friday closed above its midpoint, it was a reversal day. The bulls see it as a buy signal bar. At a minimum, they want a reversal back up to the middle of the 3-month trading range. Since it is coming at the bottom of a 3-month trading range and the Emini is oversold, the Emini should bounce early next week.<p>The bulls currently have a 40% chance of a reversal up from above the September low to the top of the 3-month range. Why not higher probability? Because the 3-week bear channel is tight. Also, that ioi sell setup on the monthly chart will probably lead to November falling below the October low. Since that low is just above the September low, the Emini will probably test below the September low as well.<h3 id=\"18-possible-island-bottom\">Possible island bottom</h3><p>This Emini gapped down this week. That created a month-long island top with the September 28 gap up. But island tops and bottoms are usually minor reversals. There are always other technical factors that are more important.<p>If there is a gap up on any day next week, there would be an island bottom with this week’s gap down. However, there is resistance above at the 50-day MA and the middle of the 3-month trading range. Also, the momentum down has been strong for 3 weeks. Finally, there is an ioi sell signal on the monthly chart. All of these are more important. Therefore, an island bottom might lead to a bounce for a week or so, but traders will still expect the Emini to fall below the November low.<h3 id=\"19-what-about-the-us-election\">What about the US election?</h3><p>The stock market does not care who is president. It only cares about the Fed. Some presidents claim to have magical superpowers and control over everything, but that is nonsense. The stock market went up more under Clinton and Obama than under Bush and Trump. Our system is much bigger that one person. The president is such a tiny part of the calculus that he is not worth considering when debating whether the market will go up or down.<p>Confusion and lawsuits after the election could cause a sharp selloff, but it won’t last. The bulls will buy a 1 to 2-month selloff and the bears will sell a 1 to 2-month rally, no matter who is in the White House. Why? Because the market has been in a trading range for 3 years and traders will fade (bet against) moves up and down.<h2 id=\"20-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
