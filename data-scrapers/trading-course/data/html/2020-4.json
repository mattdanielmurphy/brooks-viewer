But since last week had a big tail on top and the bear trend was so strong, the buy setup was weak. That means traders suspected that there might be more sellers than buyers above last week’s high. Yesterday reversed down after going just barely above last week’s high.<p>After 6 days without a pullback, the Emini is overbought. Traders expected a pullback today. The selling began yesterday once traders saw that the Emini was failing to get far above last week’s high. They expect about a 50% pullback ahead of Friday’s horrendous unemployment report.<p>Today’s gap down will trigger a sell signal on the daily chart. The bears see the rally as just a test of the 20 day EMA in a bear trend.<p>However, because the 5 day rally has been strong, there will probably be buyers at around a 50% retracement of last week’s rally.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>After a 6 day bull micro channel, today was likely to trade below yesterday’s low and begin a 2 – 5 day pullback. When traders saw yesterday that the Emini was unable to break strongly above last week’s high, they sold. The selling continued overnight.<p>The Emini is down 92 points in the Globex session and it will probably open with a big gap down today. When there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the EMA on the 5 minute chart. Day traders do not want to sell far below the average price.<p>This results in an hour or two of trading range price action 80% of the time. The bulls will look for a double bottom or wedge bottom for a swing up. The bears want a wedge top or double top around the EMA for a swing down. When there is an early trading range, there is a reduced chance of a strong trend day. A trend typically will reverse or enter a trading range after a few hours.<p>Traders know that the Emini can trend strongly at any time. But experienced traders know that there is only a 20% chance of a big bull or bear trend day when there is a big gap down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-expanding-triangle-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-1.png\" alt=\"Emini expanding triangle top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The rally was a buy climax and a test of the EMA and the March 16 lower high. Because it was extreme, it was a buy climax. The bulls are taking some profits and the bears are selling. Both are betting on a 2 – 5 day pullback.<p>Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg up to test last week’s high. Since the EURUSD is in the middle of a trading range, traders are looking for reversals every few days.<p>March was almost a perfect doji on the monthly chart (not shown). It was a huge doji, but the month closed in the middle of an 8 month trading range. There is no evidence that the EURUSD is likely to successfully break out of the top or bottom this month. Traders are expecting more trading range price action.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off strongly for a couple hours at the start of the European session, but then went sideways once it broke sightly below yesterday’s low. It has been in a tight trading range for 3 hours. The range has been so tight that it has been difficult for scalpers to make even 10 pips.<p>Because the trading range is after a bear trend, trend resumption down is slightly more likely than a trend reversal up. But it is important to recognize that a market cannot be in a tight trading range unless the bulls and bears are equally strong. While the bears have slightly higher probability of a successful breakout, the odds are still close to 50 – 50.<p>Furthermore, a tight range late in a bear trend is typically the Final Bear Flag. Consequently, even if the bears get their breakout, it probably will not get far. There will usually soon be a reversal back into the range. That reversal often continues far above the range.<p>Traders assume the market will not fall much further today. There is a slightly increased chance of a rally whether or not there is a bear breakout first. Currently, day traders are scalping, but most should wait for a breakout up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-wedge-rally-and-then-wedge-bear-channel-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge rally and then wedge bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bears see today as the resumption of the bear trend on the daily chart after a test of the 20 day EMA.<p>But, today was climactic and there was a strong reversal up into the close from a wedge bottom. Also, after a 7 day bull micro channel, the bulls want a 2nd leg sideways to up. They hope that today’s late reversal is the start.<p>However, the Emini might be sideways tomorrow after today’s sell climax and ahead of Friday’s unemployment report. Everyone knows the report will be horrendous. What no on knows is how the market will respond.

However, following a 7 day bull micro channel, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they get a test of the low.<p>There was a late reversal up yesterday on the 5 minute chart from a big wedge bottom. That makes at least a small 2nd leg up likely today.<p>In addition, last week is a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. The buy was triggered this week when this week broke above last week’s high. The bulls see yesterday as a pullback from the break above last week’s high.<p>When there are conflicting signals, there is confusion. That usually results in a trading range.<p>Finally, there is uncertainty about tomorrow’s unemployment report. Everyone knows it will be bad. No one knows how the market will react. It is still more likely that the bulls will get a 2nd leg sideways to up before there is a new low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. There will probably be a 2nd leg sideways to up after yesterday’s late rally from a big wedge bottom on the 5 minute chart.<p>A wedge with big swings up and down like that typically evolves into a trading range. With tomorrow’s unemployment report being unusually important, that increases the chance of a mostly sideways day today. The confusion over the buy signal on the weekly chart and the sell signal on the daily chart further increases the chance of sideways trading.<p>Day traders should expect at least one swing up and one swing down today.

There have been several recent abrupt reversals up and down. The bears hope that this rally is simply a pullback from the March breakout to a new low.<p>But last week’s rally was so strong, many bulls will buy this week’s selloff. It is more likely that the selloff will form a higher low within the next few days and then test the March 16 high again.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has traded down in a Spike and Channel Bear Trend overnight. That pattern usually has a bull break above the bear channel and then a rally up to the start of the channel. That target is the lower high at 1.0940. Then, the chart typically evolves into a trading range.<p>Consequently, even though the bulls have not been buying, they are looking to buy. Day traders will continue to sell rallies, but they will soon only scalp. Since the target for the bulls is only about 40 pips above the current price, when they buy, they, too, will be scalping. Unless the bars become much bigger, day traders will look for quick profits up and down today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-2nd-leg-bull-trap-and-then-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini 2nd leg bull trap and then bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This was also at the 2500 Big Round Number.<p>Although it was mostly a trading range day, the early bull trend resumed and the Emini closed near the high. If it gaps up tomorrow, there will be a 2 day island bottom. Remember, after a 7 day micro channel on the daily chart, this pullback was likely to last only 2 – 3 days.<p>Traders are waiting for tomorrow’s unemployment report. Everyone knows it will be bad. No one knows if that is already fully priced into the market. Because of the report before the open tomorrow, there is an increased chance of a trend day up or down.<p>Tomorrow is Friday. This week triggered a weekly buy signal. The bulls therefore would like this week to close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That makes at least a small 2nd leg up likely today.<p>In addition, last week is a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. The buy was triggered this week when this week broke above last week’s high. The bulls see yesterday as a pullback from the break above last week’s high.<p>When there are conflicting signals, there is confusion. That usually results in a trading range.<p>Finally, there is uncertainty about tomorrow’s unemployment report. Everyone knows it will be bad. No one knows how the market will react. It is still more likely that the bulls will get a 2nd leg sideways to up before there is a new low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. There will probably be a 2nd leg sideways to up after yesterday’s late rally from a big wedge bottom on the 5 minute chart.<p>A wedge with big swings up and down like that typically evolves into a trading range. With tomorrow’s unemployment report being unusually important, that increases the chance of a mostly sideways day today. The confusion over the buy signal on the weekly chart and the sell signal on the daily chart further increases the chance of sideways trading.<p>Day traders should expect at least one swing up and one swing down today. Any day can be a big trend day. However, the odds favor trading range trading today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-wedge-rally-and-then-wedge-bear-channel-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge rally and then wedge bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-pullback-from-strong-leg-up-in-expanding-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-2-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex pullback from strong leg up in expanding triangle\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market is in the middle of a 6 month expanding triangle. There have been several recent abrupt reversals up and down. The bears hope that this rally is simply a pullback from the March breakout to a new low.<p>But last week’s rally was so strong, many bulls will buy this week’s selloff. It is more likely that the selloff will form a higher low within the next few days and then test the March 16 high again.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has traded down in a Spike and Channel Bear Trend overnight. That pattern usually has a bull break above the bear channel and then a rally up to the start of the channel. That target is the lower high at 1.0940. Then, the chart typically evolves into a trading range.<p>Consequently, even though the bulls have not been buying, they are looking to buy. Day traders will continue to sell rallies, but they will soon only scalp. Since the target for the bulls is only about 40 pips above the current price, when they buy, they, too, will be scalping. Unless the bars become much bigger, day traders will look for quick profits up and down today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-2nd-leg-bull-trap-and-then-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini 2nd leg bull trap and then bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This was also at the 2500 Big Round Number.<p>Although it was mostly a trading range day, the early bull trend resumed and the Emini closed near the high. If it gaps up tomorrow, there will be a 2 day island bottom. Remember, after a 7 day micro channel on the daily chart, this pullback was likely to last only 2 – 3 days.<p>Traders are waiting for tomorrow’s unemployment report. Everyone knows it will be bad. No one knows if that is already fully priced into the market. Because of the report before the open tomorrow, there is an increased chance of a trend day up or down.<p>Tomorrow is Friday. This week triggered a weekly buy signal. The bulls therefore would like this week to close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Since it was expected, the market barely reacted. The Emini is down 6 points in the Globex session.<p>The bulls want the Emini to break strongly above 2500 and the EMA on the 60 minute chart. It got above both yesterday, but failed to accelerate up. That increases the chance of more sideways trading or even a reversal down today. The bulls need a strong break above that resistance if today will become a bull trend day.<p>Markets have inertia. After 2 sideways days, the odds favor another one today. Unless there is a strong move up or down, day traders will look for at least one leg up and one leg down today.<p>Traders are deciding whether the bear flag on the daily chart will lead to a higher low or a new low. After 2 sideways days, the answer is not yet clear.<p>The selloff might not be deep enough to attract buyers. Also, it was not climactic and therefore there has not been a V bottom this week.<p>This lack of clarity increases the chance of a 3rd sideways day today. If the day remains small, the Emini might get drawn to weekly targets at the end of the day. These include this week’s open, high and low, and last week’s close and high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-2nd-leg-bull-trap-and-then-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-3.png\" alt=\"Emini 2nd leg bull trap and then bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If the bulls do not get a reversal up today or tomorrow, traders will expect a new low.<p>This selloff so far has 4 big bear bodies. But they followed 4 even bigger bull bodies. Markets like symmetry. That increases the chance of a reversal up today or Monday.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off early in the European session, but it then entered a tight trading range. Day traders have been scalping for 10 pips for the past 5 hours. The daily chart is oversold and a 2nd leg up is likely on the daily chart.

If they can keep the day near its low, that will increase the chance of lower prices next week. There is not much incentive for them to drive the market down from here today.<p>Therefore, there is probably not much left to the downside today.

The 1st target is 2706.00, which is 20% down from the high. Last week is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. But there will probably be buyers below its low for a 2nd leg up on the daily chart.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market is bouncing from the first reversal down from a buy climax. Traders should expect a lower high and a 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has had many big legs up and down in recent weeks. It will probably be sideways for at least a couple more weeks.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Rally to a lower high after a buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bond-futures-weekly-chart-in-trading-range-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-4.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly chart in trading range after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures pulled back for the past 3 weeks from the most extreme buy climax in its history. By going above last week’s high, the weekly chart triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal this week.<p>But last week was only a doji bar, which is a weak buy signal bar. That lowers the probability of s significant rally.<p>Also, the doji followed 2 huge bars with bear bodies. Those bars formed the big reversal down. They create a bad context for bulls looking for an immediate resumption of the bull trend.<h3>What do the bulls want to see?</h3><p>When there is an extreme buy climax like that, the bulls take profits and then wait. They are not looking to buy again just 3 bars later. If that was their thought, they would not have exited.<p>Because those big bear bars told us that many big bulls exited, traders expect more of a pullback before the bulls will return. My typical guide is TBTL, Ten Bars, Two Legs. Also, I want to see a test down to support, like the 20 week EMA, a breakout point, a bull trend line, or a prior higher low.<p>Why 2 legs sideways to down? The bulls want to give the bears at least a couple chances to reverse the bull trend into a bear trend. If the bears fail twice, then the bulls will look to buy again. That is how a High 2 bull flag is created. If the bears fail 3 times, there is then either a triangle or a wedge bull flag.<p>The bulls will want evidence that the bears are giving up. They especially like to see several bull bars closing near their highs. Also, they prefer a buy signal bar with at least an average size body and closing near its high.<p>Another sign that the bears are weak and that the bulls are still strong is if the pullback that holds support. Examples include the EMA, a breakout point, a bull trend line, or a prior higher low or a double top.<h3>This pullback from the high has more to go</h3><p>This pullback is early and there is still work to do. The pullback so far was only 1 week, and there are now only 3 sideways weeks since the high. Traders want to see a longer pullback, like about 10 bars. They also want to see 2 – 3 legs of sideways to down trading. This pullback has not met these objectives.<p>The candlestick from 2 weeks ago was huge and it had a big tail below. The low held above the August 28 breakout point. That candlestick was a successful breakout test. The big tail on the bottom of the candlestick means that the bond futures got near that breakout point, but then reversed up sharply. That is good for the bulls.<p>However, the pullback has not reached the EMA, which is a magnet below. Also, it did not test the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the low of those 3 big bull candlesticks in late February.<p>While the bond futures can still trade higher for another couple of weeks, there will probably be a lower high. Traders expect more sideways to down trading before considering buying aggressively again.<h3>What about a bear trend instead of a pullback?</h3><p>It is important to note that the trading range will form some kind of major trend reversal sell signal. For example, there might be a lower high or a wedge rally to a double top.<p>If these form, then the bears will have a 40% chance of beginning a bigger correction. Their 1st target would be the November low That is the bottom of a 4 month triangle.<p>A triangle late in a bull trend is an area of agreement. If the bulls break above it, as they have, the market usually sees the price as too high. Traders expect a pullback to the apex of the triangle. Consequently, there will probably be a pullback to the 154 area at some point this year.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Repeated big reversals make more sideways likely</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-weekly-Forex-chart-in-expanding-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-4-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD weekly Forex chart in expanding triangle\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart has had many abrupt reversals over the past 6 weeks. Traders are deciding if the 2 year bear trend will continue to below the January 2017 start of the bull trend. If it does, traders will then expect a test of par (1.0).<p>The alternative is a reversal up from the 2 year bear trend. The bulls want a successful breakout above the 20 month bear channel and a rally back to the start of the channel. That is the September 2019 high, which was the top of the first strong bounce after the sharp bear breakout in April 2017.<p>Which is more likely? You tell me. When the market is repeatedly reversing and the reversals are abrupt and big, neither the bulls nor the bars can maintain control. They both take quick profits because they believe that another reversal is more likely than a successful breakout of the 8 month trading range.<p>Because the trading range is in a 2 year bear trend, there is always going to be a slightly higher probability of a bear breakout. But the EURUSD would not be going sideways if the bears had a significant advantage. It would be selling off relentlessly.<p>Markets have inertia. There is a strong tendency for a trend to continue. But there is also a strong tendency for a trading range to continue as well. As a result, no matter how strong the legs up and down have been over the past couple months, each has reverse.<h3>March was a huge doji candlestick on the monthly chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-monthly-Forex-chart-in-tight-trading-range-in-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-4-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD monthly Forex chart in tight trading range in bear trend\"></a></figure><p>The monthly candlestick in March was huge. It broke above and then below the 20 month bear channel. It then closed almost exactly where it opened, which was the middle of the 8 month tight trading range.<p>That big doji bar in March is a sign that the EURUSD is intensely neutral. Consequently, April will probably be sideways as well. Since April open in the middle of March’s huge range, April will probably not break out of that range. It would then be an inside bar after an outside bar.<p>Since the bar before an outside bar is within the range of the outside bar, the sequence is inside-outside-inside. This is an ioi pattern. That means the market is perfectly balanced and in breakout mode.<p>When the market is in Breakout Mode, there is a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout will reverse.<p>Even if April goes beyond the March range, it will probably not get far above or below. It has opened in the middle of the March range. Therefore, if it breaks out, it will mostly overlap March. That would be a continuation of the 8 month range.<h3>Traders expect more sideways trading next week</h3><p>What will traders expect next week? The same as they have for months. If the EURUSD goes down, they will look for it to reverse up. If it goes up, they expect it to reverse down. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders will continue to bet on reversals until there is clear breakout.<h2>Coronavirus: The pandemic is an excuse, not the fundamental problem</h2><p>I want to repeat a point that I have made several times. The charts over the past 2 1/2 years have told me that the bull trend was ending. It is easy to say that the pandemic took a good economy and made it bad. That is not what happened.<p>The pandemic came during a sick stock market. It started an unwinding that was going to happen soon anyway even without the pandemic.<p>How do I know? The pandemic will be over in a couple years. Let’s see if the stock market is far above the February high in 3 – 5 years. It won’t be, and people won’t have the pandemic to blame anymore. They then will have to begin to accept that the economy was in trouble since late 2017, not since February 2020.<h3>The pandemic math is telling a different story</h3><p>Dr. Fauci said that the best case is that we will lose 100,000 people. With a death rate of 1 – 2%, that means we will have about 10 million infected. A big number, but is it really?<p>There are over 300 million people in America. That means he is thinking that only 3% of the country will be infected. Does anyone really believe that a 3% problem caused the stock market to fall 35% in a month? The behavior of the American people and of the economy is telling us that the problem is much bigger than a 3% pandemic.<p>I have 2 explanations. First, his best case scenario could be absurd. Past pandemics have infected 20 – 50% of a population. If that happens here, then maybe a million people will die. I have looked at the charts and I understand how he gets 100,000. I agree that it is reasonable to estimate that only several hundred thousand people will die in the US. That still does not eliminate a third of the country’s wealth in a month.<h3>My 2nd explanation is more important</h3><p>My other explanation is the one I keep saying, but so far, I am the only one. That is that there have been serious problems in the economy since 2017 that have been hidden by the residual momentum of a decade-long bull trend.<p>The pandemic is lifting the lid and now people are beginning to discover what is really under the surface. They see a stock market pumped up by stock buybacks, government and corporate debt, and ridiculous policies. And they are afraid that this is a weak foundation to support a rally to the highs in February.<p>That means that the decade-long bull trend was doomed to end with or without a pandemic. There is always a trigger. If it was not coronavirus, it would have been something else.<p>But what happens long after the pandemic is gone and the stock market is still floundering? Everyone will come to accept that the problem was the economy and not the pandemic. They will then conclude that this is a secular (decade long) bear market and not just the usual 1 – 2 year cyclical bear trend within a secular (decade long) bull market.<h2>The Economy: The Fed is everyone’s insurance policy</h2><p>I said that traders believe that the Fed will prevent a free-fall. Sometimes you will hear that the Fed is a “put” under the market. By that, traders mean that the Fed will act like a put option for your account. They will protect everyone’s portfolios from horrendous losses.<p>Traders see the Fed as guaranteeing that selloffs will not get too big. The Fed is the market’s insurance policy. How big is too big? The biggest selloffs since WWII were about 60%. Traders will bet that the Fed will use that as its benchmark.<h3>How to trade using the Fed</h3><p>It is important to remember why the Federal Reserve was created. It exists to maintain a stable and growing economy through price stability and full employment. The Fed governors are the best people in the country in terms of both intellect and integrity. If we are going to trust anyone, we are going to trust them.<p>I said that traders believe that the Fed will prevent the market from falling below some undisclosed level. That has created a sense that a trader can buy at any time and safely buy more lower, trusting that the Fed will protect them.<p>Let me tell you a secret. That undisclosed level is around 60%. Why? Because that has been around the biggest selloff since the Great Depression. The Fed knows that if it allows a bigger selloff, there could be tremendous panic and damage to the economy. They would violate their mandate.<h3>At what level is it safe to buy?</h3><p>With many traders confident that the market will not fall much below 60%, they know that there will be lots of buyers somewhere above the 60% level. No one ever knows how far a selloff will fall, but if you are confident that 60% is the floor, you might be inclined to start buying when the market is down 30 or 40%. Then buy more at 50 or 60%, betting on a strong bounce off the Fed’s secret floor.<p>What happens if I am wrong and the floor is 70%? It might be, but the principle is the same. The Fed will create a floor. They said essentially that they will print “infinite dollars” to protect the economy.<p>Traders also believe that the Fed will use some of that money to buy ETFs, if necessary, to stop a collapse. If it buys ETFs, it would essentially be buying a broad basket of stocks. The market is made up of stocks. If there is strong buying, the market will go up.<h3>Can the Fed fix this mess?</h3><p>No. The damage that the economy has suffered is broad and deep. It is as if an Olympic sprinter broke both legs and his pelvis in a car accident. The doctor might save his life, but he’s not going to be winning gold medals any time soon. The sprinter has to heal himself. The doctor has no magic that immediately makes him normal again.<p>Remember, the Fed’s mandate is to maintain a stable economy. That means it exists to prevent disaster. It does not exist to take a horribly damaged economy and quickly make it normal. It could not do that even if it wanted to. The Fed is simply trying to prevent a bad situation from getting worse.<p>It cannot turn that terrible economy into a good economy. The economy has to heal itself. The stock market was the most overbought in its history. It will take a decade for the fundamentals to catch up with price.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Bull inside bar after extreme sell climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-4-3.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini monthly candlestick chart has inside bar after bear trend reversal\"></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart so far in April has a small bull bar. It is within March’s range and it is therefore a bull inside bar.<p>February and March were huge bear bars. It is important to note that March had a big tail on the bottom of its candlestick. Furthermore, after March broke far below the 11 year bull trend line, it closed almost back to that line. In addition, it briefly broke below the 2 year trading range, but closed significantly above the December 2018 bottom of the range.<p>This strong buying makes it likely that the 2 year trading range will continue for a least another month or two. It might even continue all year.<h3>Expect big correction after biggest buy climax in history</h3><p>At the top of the 2017 buy climax, I said that the Emini’s strong bull trend would soon end. I wrote<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/trump-corporate-tax-cut-rally-might-be-january-barometer/#buy-climaxes-on-daily-weekly-monthly-charts\" target=\"_blank\">that rally in 2017 was the most extreme buy climax in the history of the stock market</a>on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<p>The price had gotten far ahead of the fundamentals and the rally was unsustainable. The two years of chaos that followed indicated that the bulls were just not able to extend the buy climax any further. The rally had to end.<p>When a bull market ends, the market sometimes quickly reverses into a bear trend. Much more often, it enters a trading range. That trading range can last 50 to 100 bars when the buy climax is extreme. On the monthly chart, that means a decade.<h3>Trading range for the next decade</h3><p>I have repeatedly written for more than 2 years said that the 2020’s will probably be mostly sideways. Traders should expect it to resemble the decades that followed the buy climaxes of the 1960’s and 1990’s. Both of those trading ranges lasted about 10 years.<p>There were at least a couple 40 – 60% pullbacks. There were also rallies that lasted as long as 5 years. But, the market remained sideways. It failed to break far above prior highs or far below prior lows. That is what is most likely going forward.<p>The range will probably be approximately between 1800 to 3600. Traders will buy selloffs, especially since the Fed essentially made it clear that they will prevent a free-fall. More on that below.<h3>A lot of supply above</h3><p>But what happens if there is a new high? The Fed certainly would not stop it. What, then, would? There is a huge supply of stock around the February high. All of the bulls who did not exit have been shocked by the ferocity of this selloff. They do not believe that there will be a big new high anytime soon.<p>They correctly believe that the 12 year bull trend has ended. The market is now in either a bear trend or a trading range. In either case, they know that it makes sense to exit or even short on rallies. Many therefore are eager to exit their positions up near the old high. This would reduce their current loss.<p>Also, the bears see how strong the selloff was from around 3400. If the Emini gets back there, they will aggressively sell, betting that lots of other traders will again sell there.<p>Traders expect that there are so many bulls and bears eager to sell around the old high that the first rally up there will probably reverse down. The result of the supply at the old high and the Fed protecting the downside will be a trading range.<h3>At least 3 years before test of old high</h3><p>Once the S&amp;P500 cash index closes 20% down from the all-time high, it is in a bear market. The average bear market lasts over a year. It usually takes 2 more years before there is a new high. That is what is typical.<p>But this selloff was far stronger that the typical initial selloff in a bear market. Traders should assume that the recovery will take much longer.<p>Does that mean 5 years instead of 3? Who knows? But I do know that it took about 10 years in the 1970’s and again in the 2000’s. Therefore it is reasonable to assume it will take about that long this time as well.<p>There are always many other possibilities. At the moment, there is a 30% chance that the bull trend will resume and the stock market will be far above the old high within a few years. But that means there is a 70% chance it will not.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Weak buy signal triggered this week</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP500-Emini-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-Low-1-sell-signal-after-expanding-triangle-buy-signal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-4-4.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini weekly candlestick chart has Low 1 sell signal after expanding triangle buy signal\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed up last week from an expanding triangle that began with the January 2018 high. Last week was a big outside up bar and it was therefore a buy signal bar. The weekly buy signal triggered this week when this week traded above last week’s high.<p>But last week’s candlestick had a big tail on top. That indicates selling at the end of the week. It is a sign that the bulls were not nearly as eager and confident as they could have been.<p>Also, it closed below the high of the week before. If the outside bar closed on its high and far above the high or the prior week, traders would have seen it as a sign of very eager bulls. That would have increased the chance of a strong reversal up.<h3>Reversal up from a sell climax is usually minor</h3><p>The 2 month selloff was exceptionally strong. This combined with the weak buy signal bar make a minor reversal up more likely than a V bottom and start of a bull trend.<p>A minor reversal means that the rally will either form a bear flag or become a bull leg in what will grow into a trading range. There is only a 30% chance of the rally growing into a bull trend without at least forming a double bottom.<p>When a sell climax is as extreme as this one has been, the bears are exhausted. The reversal sideways to up often lasts longer and goes higher than what traders might think is reasonable.<p>Exhausted bears typically are hesitant to immediately sell again once they begin to take profits. Therefore, the weekly chart will probably be sideways to up for at least a few weeks.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>2nd leg up after extreme sell climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SP500-Emini-daily-candlestick-chart-will-probably-form-higher-low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-4-5.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 Emini daily candlestick chart will probably form higher low\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed up strongly last week from an extreme sell climax. The rally reversed down from the 20 day EMA, which is a 20 Gap Bar sell signal.<p>However, that rally was a 7 bar bull micro channel. Every low was above the low of the prior day. That relentless buying usually will have at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>Traders were so eager to buy that they were not waiting for a pullback. Instead, they were buying at and above the low of the prior day. The first pullback typically only lasts 1 – 3 days because the bulls are happy to finally get an opportunity to buy below the low of the prior day.<h3>The 1st target is 2706.00, which is 20% down from the high</h3><p>As long as the Emini is below 2706, it is more than 20% down from the all time high. That means it is in a bear market.<p>When traders talk about the cash index, they say it is in a bear market if the close is 20% below the highest close. That 20% level is 2708.92.<p>The bulls want to create signs of strength. That will make other traders willing to buy as the market continues higher.<p>One sign of strength would be for the market to get back above that 20% correction level. That level is clearly important and therefore a magnet above.<p>A 50% retracement of the bear trend is at 2781. That is always a magnet.<h3>Another target is the March 3 bull trap</h3><p>The huge March 13 bull trend bar was followed by an equally strong bear bar that barely overlapped the bull bar. There are therefore trapped bulls at the close of that bull bar. Its close is just below that 2706.00 20% correction level.<p>Theoretically, the bulls who bought that close bought more lower and have been buying on the way up. They are trying to get back to their 1st buy, which is at that close.<p>Therefore, when there are trapped bulls, the market usually works its way back to the trap. Many bulls will exit breakeven there on the 1st buy and with a profit on their lower buy.<p>Sometimes, the bulls are so happy with the rally that they do not exit. Instead, they buy more. If they do, the rally could go much higher. While unlikely, it could continue up to the March 3 high of 3125.75. That was the start of the parabolic wedge sell climax, and that is often a target when there is a reversal up.<h3>What to expect next week</h3><p>The Emini will likely trade below last week’s low and trigger a weekly sell signal. Since that sell setup is weak, there will probably be buyers below last week’s low.<p>A reversal up from a higher low within the next couple weeks should reach that 2706.00 magnet above. Sometimes when the market reverses up from an extreme sell climax, it rallies in a bull channel for 100 bars or more. Therefore, a higher low could be the start of a trend up that could last many months. But even if it did, the rally would more likely be a bull leg in a trading range than a resumption of the 12 year bull trend.<p>What happens if the Emini turns down and breaks below the April low? Traders will expect buyers below. That selloff would create a double bottom with the March low. Traders would then look for at least a couple months of sideways to up trading.<p>Traders should expect a trading range for at least a few months. The top will probably be around 2700 – 2800 that the bottom will either be the March low or not far below. Since the Emini is currently low in that 2200 – 2800 range, it will likely be sideways to up over the next month or even several months.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But since there were no pullbacks in the rally, the bulls were being aggressive. That means they will probably buy this 3 day selloff, expecting at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>Furthermore, the reversal up followed a parabolic wedge sell climax. Traders therefore expect a 2nd leg sideways to up on that basis as well.<p>On the weekly chart, last week was a bear bar and a pullback in a strong bear trend. It is therefore a Low 1 sell signal bar. Traders might want to see what’s below its low. Will there be eager bears selling below the Low 1 bear flag sell signal bar? Or will the bulls get a reversal up from a higher low on the daily chart?<p>The rally on the daily chart and the strong bear trend on the weekly chart create confusion. That makes sideways trading likely. However, the top of the trading range will probably be above 2700, as I discussed over the weekend.<p>Today will probably gap up. That will create a 3 day island bottom. That increases the chance of a bull trend day today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 90 points in the Globex session. There will probably be a big gap up. But there is only a 20% chance of a relentless trend up or down from the open.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the average price (the 20 bar EMA). Traders do not like to pay far above the average price. Therefore, when there is a big gap up, there is an 80% chance of some trading range trading over the 1st hour or two.<p>The bears will try to create a wedge top or double top and then a reversal down. The bulls want to buy near the EMA. They will look for a double bottom or a wedge bull flag near the EMA.<p>If there is a trading range open, it is a sign of hesitation. It reduces the chance of a relentless trend day up or down. If there is a trend after a trading range, it will typically evolve into a trading range or reverse after a few hours.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bear-channel-and-almost-outside-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bear channel and almost outside down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-testing-bottom-of-expanding-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-6-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex testing bottom of expanding triangle\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has sold off for 6 days. Last week was a big bear bar closing near its low on the weekly chart (not shown). Traders will want to know if there will be more buyers or sellers below the low of that sell signal bar.<p>There was a strong rally 2 weeks ago. Also, the selloff is now at the bottom of the 7 month trading range. Furthermore, each of the past 5 days had a conspicuous tail on the bottom of the bar, which is a sign of buying. These factors make a bounce likely early this week.<p>Therefore, while the bears will probably trigger the weekly sell signal by getting a break below last week’s low, there will probably be more buyers than sellers there. Traders expect a 3 – 5 day bounce to start this week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has sold off in a broad bear channel overnight. The low so far is 10 pips above last week’s low. Traders expect a reversal up from around last week’s low.<p>This week could reverse up from above last week’s low and form an inside bar on the weekly chart. But 6 consecutive bear bars represents relentless selling. It is therefore more likely that the EURUSD will fall below last week’s low either today or tomorrow.<p>However, as I said above, the weekly sell signal will probably fail. There will probably be more buyers than sellers below last week’s low. The odds favor a 200 pip bounce to begin this week.<p>What about today? The overnight selloff has lacked momentum. The bars are small and the bulls have been able to make money in the bear trend.<p>Day traders will continue to buy selloffs and sell rallies today. While the EURUSD might fall below last week’s low, there will probably be buyers below. That limits the downside today.<p>Even though there might be buyers, the bars and legs are small.

But since there were no pullbacks in the rally, the bulls were being aggressive. That means they will probably buy this 3 day selloff, expecting at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>Furthermore, the reversal up followed a parabolic wedge sell climax. Traders therefore expect a 2nd leg sideways to up on that basis as well.<p>On the weekly chart, last week was a bear bar and a pullback in a strong bear trend. It is therefore a Low 1 sell signal bar. Traders might want to see what’s below its low. Will there be eager bears selling below the Low 1 bear flag sell signal bar? Or will the bulls get a reversal up from a higher low on the daily chart?<p>The rally on the daily chart and the strong bear trend on the weekly chart create confusion. That makes sideways trading likely. However, the top of the trading range will probably be above 2700, as I discussed over the weekend.<p>Today will probably gap up. That will create a 3 day island bottom. That increases the chance of a bull trend day today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 90 points in the Globex session. There will probably be a big gap up. But there is only a 20% chance of a relentless trend up or down from the open.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the average price (the 20 bar EMA). Traders do not like to pay far above the average price. Therefore, when there is a big gap up, there is an 80% chance of some trading range trading over the 1st hour or two.<p>The bears will try to create a wedge top or double top and then a reversal down. The bulls want to buy near the EMA. They will look for a double bottom or a wedge bull flag near the EMA.<p>If there is a trading range open, it is a sign of hesitation. It reduces the chance of a relentless trend day up or down. If there is a trend after a trading range, it will typically evolve into a trading range or reverse after a few hours.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bear-channel-and-almost-outside-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bear channel and almost outside down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective.

Last week was a big bear bar closing near its low on the weekly chart (not shown). Traders will want to know if there will be more buyers or sellers below the low of that sell signal bar.<p>There was a strong rally 2 weeks ago. Also, the selloff is now at the bottom of the 7 month trading range. Furthermore, each of the past 5 days had a conspicuous tail on the bottom of the bar, which is a sign of buying. These factors make a bounce likely early this week.<p>Therefore, while the bears will probably trigger the weekly sell signal by getting a break below last week’s low, there will probably be more buyers than sellers there. Traders expect a 3 – 5 day bounce to start this week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has sold off in a broad bear channel overnight. The low so far is 10 pips above last week’s low. Traders expect a reversal up from around last week’s low.<p>This week could reverse up from above last week’s low and form an inside bar on the weekly chart. But 6 consecutive bear bars represents relentless selling. It is therefore more likely that the EURUSD will fall below last week’s low either today or tomorrow.<p>However, as I said above, the weekly sell signal will probably fail. There will probably be more buyers than sellers below last week’s low. The odds favor a 200 pip bounce to begin this week.<p>What about today? The overnight selloff has lacked momentum. The bars are small and the bulls have been able to make money in the bear trend.<p>Day traders will continue to buy selloffs and sell rallies today. While the EURUSD might fall below last week’s low, there will probably be buyers below. That limits the downside today.<p>Even though there might be buyers, the bars and legs are small. That lack of energy will limit the upside.<p>Today will therefore probably transition into a trading range. The bulls want the day to close above the open so that the streak of 5 consecutive bear days will end. That would increase the chance of a bounce this week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

I have been saying for 2 weeks that there would be a reversal up to above 2706.00. The Emini is above that level in the Globex session.<p>That is 20% down from the high. As long as the Emini is below it, the Emini is in a bear market. After a parabolic wedge sell climax and an extreme 34% selloff, there were going to be value bulls coming in. Also, the bears would take profits. That 20% correction level was close enough to be a logical target.<p>Can today be a big bear trend after yesterday’s wedge rally to last week’s high? Probably not because yesterday was a Bull Surprise Bar on the daily chart. That typically leads to at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>However, since the Globex session reach my minimum target of 2706.00 and the 2 day rally was extreme, today will probably have a lot of trading range price action.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 83 points in the Globex session. There will therefore be a big gap up today. The Emini is now above that 2706 target that I have talked about for 2 weeks. It is also near a 50% pullback of the bear trend. Therefore, the bulls will probably begin to take some profits and the bears will begin to scale into shorts. This reduces the chance of a big bull trend day today.<p>Also, when there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the 20 bar EMA on the 5 minute chart. Traders do not like to pay far above the average price unless the bars on the 5 minute chart are far above average. If the 1st few bars are not big bull bars closing near their highs, many bulls will wait for the Emini to go sideways or down until it gets near the EMA. They will then look for a possible wedge bottom or double bottom around the EMA.<p>If the bears see hesitation on the open, they will look for a double top or a wedge top to sell, expecting a test down to the EMA. Less likely, that selloff could grow into a bear trend day, or the day could begin with a bear trend from the open.<p>Since there is confusion when a buy climax reaches an important target, there is an increased chance of a lot of trading range price action today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-7.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The selloff was a test of the top of the March 23 buy signal bar and the February 20 low. Also, it was a pullback from the strong rally to the March 27 high. At a minimum, the rally should reach the 20 day EMA and a 50% pullback.<p>The bounce and the context are good enough for traders to expect at least of few days of sideways to up trading. They will then decide between a test of the March 27 high and the March 23 low.<p>Trading ranges resist breaking out. Furthermore, they spend a lot of time in the middle third of the range. This 7 month expanding triangle is a triangle. A triangle is a trading range. Consequently, it is more likely that the EURUSD will be sideways to up for at least a couple weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied relentlessly overnight. However, it went sideways for a few hours until an hour ago. That trading range might be a magnet later today. But, the downside is probably not big since the context is good for the bulls on the daily chart.<p>Because the overnight pullbacks have been small, traders have mostly been buying. The body on the daily chart is now approximately the same size as the other big bodies over the past 2 weeks. There is probably not much left to the bull trend today.<p>The 20 day EMA is a magnet and it is just above the day’s high. If the bulls decide that the day will not become much bigger, they will switch to buying pullbacks instead of buying at the market. Also, they will take profits near the high of the day.<p>Once the bears see that, they will begin to sell rallies down from the high for 10 – 20 pip scalps. Day traders should expect the strong bull trend to evolve into a trading range soon. However, the reversal up is strong enough to create a bullish bias for a few days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><div class=\"wp-block-group\"></div><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-wedge-double-top-lower-high-major-trend-reversal-at-20-correction-level.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double top lower high major trend reversal at 20% correction level\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a rally that tested the high and then a 2nd selloff from a lower high double top. The 2nd high was also a lower high major trend reversal.<p>The selloff closed the gap above yesterday’s high and today closed near the low. Today is a sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The top of the developing trading range is probably between 2700 and 2800. Therefore, the Emini reached the sell zone today. It will probably not get much higher near-term. But the rally is strong enough so that the bulls will likely buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback.

However, the reversal up is strong enough to create a bullish bias for a few days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><div class=\"wp-block-group\"></div><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-wedge-double-top-lower-high-major-trend-reversal-at-20-correction-level.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double top lower high major trend reversal at 20% correction level\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a rally that tested the high and then a 2nd selloff from a lower high double top. The 2nd high was also a lower high major trend reversal.<p>The selloff closed the gap above yesterday’s high and today closed near the low. Today is a sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The top of the developing trading range is probably between 2700 and 2800. Therefore, the Emini reached the sell zone today. It will probably not get much higher near-term. But the rally is strong enough so that the bulls will likely buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback. The bears will probably want a micro double top before selling aggressively.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It closed the gap above Monday’s high and closed near the low.<p>That 2706 level is 20% down from the high. As long as the market is below that number, it is still in a bear trend.<p>This is more symbolic than real. The Emini will be sideways to down for the next year, even if it rallies more over the next few months.<p>It is now near the top of the range, which will probably be around 2700 to 2800, and possibly to 3000. The bulls are now less willing to buy here.<p>The bears are starting to sell rallies. This rally is a wedge bear flag where the March 19 high is the 1st of the 3 legs ups. Yesterday is a sell signal bar.<p>But the rally has been strong enough so that the bulls will probably buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback. Many bears will want to see at least a micro double top before aggressively shorting. Consequently, yesterday is probably not the end of this bounce.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 25 points in the Globex session. The Globex range has been small. Since yesterday was climactic, the bears are probably exhausted. That typically results in at least a couple hours of trading range price action that begins by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>The top of the range today will probably be at least around the top of the final sell climax. That is just below 2700. Also, that 2706 price is still important. It is therefore another magnet above.<p>Yesterday is a sell signal bar at resistance on the daily chart. It closed near its low. Traders today might want to see what is below yesterday’s low. The bears hope that the bulls will give up and then today will be a big bear trend day.<p>More likely, there will be buyers around and below yesterday’s low. The 3 week rally is strong enough so that there will probably be at least one more small leg up before there is a test of the March low.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-wedge-double-top-lower-high-major-trend-reversal-at-20-correction-level.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-8.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double top lower high major trend reversal at 20% correction level\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, most of the bars in the selloff had prominent tails below. Also, the selloff so far is still above the March 23 bottom of a strong rally. Consequently, this selloff is more likely forming a wedge bull flag than a bull trend.<p>Because there were 6 consecutive bear bars, there might be one more brief new breakout below this week’s low before the bulls will buy aggressively again. This is especially true since yesterday had a conspicuous tail on top and it did not close above the 20 day EMA.<h3>Triangle after expanding triangle</h3><p>With the repeated big legs up and down, there is now a triangle. This follows a 6 month expanding triangle, which means there is now a diamond pattern.<p>That is just another Breakout Mode pattern and adds nothing new. The daily chart has been going sideways for 8 months and it therefore has already been in Breakout Mode.<p>Most breakout attempts fail, like the strong rally and the strong selloff in March. But the EURUSD is closer to the bottom of the range. Also, this selloff is holding above the low of the March rally. Therefore, a breakout above the 2 week bear trend line is more likely than a test of the March 23 low.<p>Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. The odds for the bulls are almost the same as for the bears. The EURUSD will probably go sideways for at least a couple more days before breaking out of the triangle.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down overnight from below yesterday’s high. It then reversed up from above yesterday’s low. Today is therefore an inside candlestick on the daily chart. That is a one day Breakout Mode pattern, and it is within a big triangle, which is a bigger Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Will the overnight rally continue to above yesterday’s high? It might, but the bars are small and the EURUSD has spent a lot of time going sideways during this rally. It lacks energy. That makes a strong breakout unlikely.<p>Because of the 6 hour bull channel, day traders have been more interested in buying pullbacks than selling rallies. However, both bull and bear day traders have been scalping for only 10 pips.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-8-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then went sideways. There was trend resumption up to above yesterday’s high. Today closed near its high.<p>That 2706 has been a key price. It is 20% down from the all-time high. If the bulls can hold above it, traders will conclude that the bear trend has ended.<p>Traders expect a test of the 50% retracement level of the 2 month bear trend. That is 2781.00. The test will probably come in the next few days.<p>However, if the bears could get a reversal, there would be a micro double top and a wedge rally. The 1st leg up was the March 19 high. Traders would then look for a reversal down from a wedge top. If they get it, the Emini would then likely sell off for a couple weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It totally reversed Tuesday’s selloff. The next target is 2781, which the Emini reached right before the open. That is a 50% retracement of the 2 month bear trend.<p>However, the daily chart is in a trading range. The legs in a trading range usually go past support and resistance before reversing. Consequently, the odds still favor a little more to this rally before there is a pullback to the April 1 higher low.<p>If the bears get a reversal down in the next week, there would be a micro double top with Tuesday’s high. There would also be a wedge top, beginning with the March 19 high. The bears would then have a better chance of a 2 week test down to the April 1 higher low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>After getting close to the 50% pullback level overnight, the Emini sold off. However, the selloff briefly dipped below 2706, which is 20% down from the high, and it reversed up sharply a few minutes ago to back above 2781.<p>The Emini rallied yesterday in a bull channel. Traders should view a bull channel as a bear flag because there is a 75% chance of a break below the channel. It can break below by going sideways or down. The chart then typically evolves into a trading range. That is what is likely today. With the rally as strong as it is, sideways is more likely than down. Also, the channel might continue up for another day or two before there is a breakout.<p>Today is the final trading day of the week. What the Emini does today affects the appearance of the weekly chart. This week so far is a big bull bar.<p>However, both 2781 and 2706.00 are very important prices. They could be magnets in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-9.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The triangle follows an expanding triangle. This is a diamond pattern, which is a type of Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Since the EURUSD is closer to the bottom of the 7 month trading range, it is slightly more likely to break above the bull trend line and test the March 27 high. However, a chart would not have a Breakout Mode pattern if either the bulls or bears had a significant advantage. Traders think that the odds are about 50% for the bulls and bears. It is important to note that the 1st breakout in a Breakout Mode Pattern fails 50% of the time.<p>The EURUSD reversed up 2 days ago. Traders see yesterday as a pull back from that rally. They therefore expect at least a small 2nd leg up within a few days.<p>However, there is room to the bear trend line. Consequently, it is possible that the bulls can get a small 2nd leg up without breaking out of the diamond pattern.<p>The bears hope that the small 2nd leg up stalls at Tuesday’s high and the EMA. They then would want a reversal down from a micro double top at the EMA.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from just below yesterday’s high and up from just above yesterday’s low. Today so far is an inside day. Yesterday was also an inside day. Consecutive inside days on the daily chart is always some type of triangle on the 5 or to minute charts and it is a Breakout Mode pattern.

It totally reversed Tuesday’s selloff. The next target is 2781, which the Emini reached right before the open. That is a 50% retracement of the 2 month bear trend.<p>However, the daily chart is in a trading range. The legs in a trading range usually go past support and resistance before reversing. Consequently, the odds still favor a little more to this rally before there is a pullback to the April 1 higher low.<p>If the bears get a reversal down in the next week, there would be a micro double top with Tuesday’s high. There would also be a wedge top, beginning with the March 19 high. The bears would then have a better chance of a 2 week test down to the April 1 higher low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>After getting close to the 50% pullback level overnight, the Emini sold off. However, the selloff briefly dipped below 2706, which is 20% down from the high, and it reversed up sharply a few minutes ago to back above 2781.<p>The Emini rallied yesterday in a bull channel. Traders should view a bull channel as a bear flag because there is a 75% chance of a break below the channel. It can break below by going sideways or down. The chart then typically evolves into a trading range. That is what is likely today. With the rally as strong as it is, sideways is more likely than down. Also, the channel might continue up for another day or two before there is a breakout.<p>Today is the final trading day of the week. What the Emini does today affects the appearance of the weekly chart. This week so far is a big bull bar.<p>However, both 2781 and 2706.00 are very important prices. They could be magnets in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-9.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The triangle follows an expanding triangle. This is a diamond pattern, which is a type of Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Since the EURUSD is closer to the bottom of the 7 month trading range, it is slightly more likely to break above the bull trend line and test the March 27 high. However, a chart would not have a Breakout Mode pattern if either the bulls or bears had a significant advantage. Traders think that the odds are about 50% for the bulls and bears. It is important to note that the 1st breakout in a Breakout Mode Pattern fails 50% of the time.<p>The EURUSD reversed up 2 days ago. Traders see yesterday as a pull back from that rally. They therefore expect at least a small 2nd leg up within a few days.<p>However, there is room to the bear trend line. Consequently, it is possible that the bulls can get a small 2nd leg up without breaking out of the diamond pattern.<p>The bears hope that the small 2nd leg up stalls at Tuesday’s high and the EMA. They then would want a reversal down from a micro double top at the EMA.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down from just below yesterday’s high and up from just above yesterday’s low. Today so far is an inside day. Yesterday was also an inside day. Consecutive inside days on the daily chart is always some type of triangle on the 5 or to minute charts and it is a Breakout Mode pattern. It is nested within the Breakout Mode pattern on the daily chart.<p>The breakout can come at any time. When it does, it could be the start of a strong trend on up or down on all time frames.<p>However, until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. While waiting, day traders will continue to look for reversals to scalp for 10 – 20 pips.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trading-range-at-50-percent-retracement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range at 50 percent retracement\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There is no top yet. However, the rally is probably a bull leg in what will become a trading range. Traders should expect a 2 week bear leg to begin by the end of the month.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>had a blow-off top in March. They will probably be sideways to down for the rest of the year.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has been in a trading range for 8 months. It is reversing up from the bottom of the range. Traders should expect higher prices next week.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Blow off top in bull trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-shows-extreme-buy-climax-at-measured-move-target-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-11.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart shows extreme buy climax at measured move target\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures so far this month is forming a small bar in the middle of last month’s range. The 1st 3 months of this year formed the 3 biggest consecutive bull trend bars in the entire bull trend. When the strongest breakout comes late in a bull trend, there is a 60% chance that it is at least a temporary end of the trend.<p>This buy climax reversed down from a measured move based on a 4 year trading range. It also reversed down from a failed breakout above top of the bull channel.<p>This is an example of a blow-off top. That is an extreme buy climax late in a bull trend at significant resistance. It typically will attract profit taking. Bears will also sell. The result will probably be at least a pause in the bull trend. More likely, it will lead to a protracted trading range and eventually a bear trend.<p>When a trend ends, it sometimes reverses into an opposite trend. But more often, it transitions into a trading range. The range typically has at least a couple legs sideways to down and lasts at least about 10 bars. Since this is a monthly chart, that is about a year.<p>After that, the chart would be in Breakout Mode. Theoretically, there would be an equal chance of a bull or bear breakout. If there is a bull breakout, the trading range would probably be the Final Bull Flag. That means the breakout would likely fail. Traders would expect a reversal into a bear trend that could last a decade.<h3>What happens if there is a bear breakout?</h3><p>If instead there is a bear breakout below the upcoming trading range, there is a 50% chance that it would lead to a bear trend. There is also a 50% chance that it would reverse up and just increase the height of the trading range.<p>The first reversal down from a climactic reversal usually retraces to the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the January low at around 154.<p>However, trends in the bond market typically last for 2 – 3 decades. Consequently, the bond market will probably work lower for at least 10 years. This is true even though it has not yet begun to trend down. The transition from a bull trend to a bear trend can take many years.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Reversing up from bottom of expanding triangle</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-reversing-up-from-expanding-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-11-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart reversing up from expanding triangle\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart has had exceptionally big reversals for a couple of months. That increases the chance of a breakout up or down. When a chart is in Breakout Mode, there is a 50% chance of either a bull or bear breakout. The chart would not be going sideways for 8 months if either side was clearly in control.<p>A Breakout Mode pattern also has a 50% chance of the 1st breakout attempt failing. March had both a failed bull breakout and a failed bear breakout.<p>Last week was a Low 1 sell signal bar. This week triggered the sell signal by trading below last week’s low. But there were more buyers than sellers below the sell signal bar. This week is now a buy signal bar for next week.<p>The EURUSD is near the bottom of the 8 month trading range. It reversed up again this week after strongly reversing up 2 weeks ago. This increases the chance of higher prices next week. The targets above are the March 27 high and maybe even the March 9 high.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>1 – 3 month bounce from Bear Surprise Breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-reversing-up-in-trading-range-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart reversing up in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has been sideways for more than 2 years. February and March formed a pair of surprisingly big bear bars and began a bear trend reversal. A bear surprise typically has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>But the bounce sometimes will erase much of the selloff before the 2nd leg begins. Rarely, the rally will go to a new high before there is a 2nd leg down.<p>At the moment, there is a 70% chance that this reversal up will fail within 3 months. Traders should then expect a test down to around the 2018 or 2020 lows.<h3>The bulls are hoping that the bull trend is resuming</h3><p>The bulls have good reasons to be hopeful. The monthly chart is still in a trading range. Every bear trend since the Great Depression ended at a monthly bull trend line. This selloff reversed up strongly from below a 10 year bull trend line.<p>It also reversed up from below the bottom of a 2 year trading range. That trading range is an expanding triangle. A triangle in a bull trend is a bull flag. That means a bull breakout is usually more likely. If this month remains a bull inside bar closing near its high, it would be a buy signal bar for next month.<p>While all of these factors are good for the bulls, the bear Surprise Breakout is more important. It was extremely big and it came late in a bull trend. Also, it followed the most extreme buy climax in history (<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/trump-corporate-tax-cut-rally-might-be-january-barometer/#buy-climaxes-on-daily-weekly-monthly-charts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the 2017 rally</a>). There is only a 30% chance that this rally will continue up to a new high without first having a test back down.<h3>Trading range will probably form a major topping pattern</h3><p>The 2 year trading range will probably last all year. If so, there will be at least one lower high. It would be a lower high major trend reversal sell setup. Traders will begin to talk about it as the right shoulder of a 2 year head and shoulders top. The September 2018 rally is the left shoulder.<p>Every trading range has both a credible buy and sell setup. However, trading ranges have inertia. They resist change. Consequently, if the bears get a reasonable lower high with a good sell signal bar, they will have only a 40% chance that the signal would lead to a bear trend.<p>More often, the reversal does not get far and the trading range continues. Traders then watch for the next buy or sell signal.<h3>Lasting effect from the pandemic</h3><p>I have been saying since late last year that the 2 year trading range would probably continue all year. This is still true. In fact, the stock market will probably be in a trading range from 1800 to 3600 for the next decade.<p>However, I keep making the point that this was due to the extreme buy climax that ended in late 2017 and not the pandemic. The pandemic simply unleashed what was already going to happen. The market was just waiting for a trigger.<p>But the pandemic will still be very important over the next year. It has significantly changed consumer habits. Consumer spending is responsible for 70% of the GDP. Are you going out to dinner or traveling as much as last year? How often have you been to the mall in the past 2 months? How much have you driven lately? We all are spending less.<p>The huge surge in unemployment is further greatly reducing the GDP. These changes will not return to normal for many months after a vaccine. Therefore, the pandemic will continue to hurt economy for at least another year.<h3>The Fed has been amazing</h3><p>As many of you know, I have been critical of Fed Chairman Powell because he appeared to be intimidated by President Trump. However, he and the Fed have done an extremely good job with this catastrophe.<p>The market is rallying because it was oversold and because everyone loves what the Fed has been doing. It continues to release a series of nice surprises that greatly bolster consumer confidence.<p>But as I have been saying, all they are doing is preventing a disastrous problem from destroying the economy. They are treating the problem, but they cannot fix it. There is a limit to how far the rally can go, given that the pandemic will keep the economy weak for at least a year.<h3>What happens when the Fed stops doing nice things?</h3><p>Part of the rally is a bet that there will be a next nice Fed surprise. At some point, the Fed will be finished. The part of the rally built on the expectation of more surprises will stop. Those traders will not only stop buying, they will begin to take profits. I doubt the Fed has enough surprises lined up to take the market back to the old high.<p>More importantly, the forces behind that 2017 buy climax will be with us for a decade. Therefore, even though the Fed is averting a depression, it will not be able to make the economy healthy again.<h3>A new high would result in a very overbought P/E ratio</h3><p>The price of the S&amp;P index relative the to average earnings of the stocks in the index (P/E ratio) was 25 in early February. That is at the high end of the historical range. The average is around 19.5. Earnings will be far below normal for many months and probably the remainder of the year.<p>What happens if the stock market gets back to the February high this year? This time, that price would be relatively much more expensive because the earnings will be so much lower. The P/E ratio would be extremely overbought. Fewer institutions will be willing to pay that price for those earnings.<p>How many people want to pay a high price when the average company is not earning much? I will let someone else buy up there. I will be looking to sell.<p>Since late 2017, price has been too far ahead of fundamentals. It typically takes a decade for the fundamentals to catch up. The 2020’s will probably be similar to the 1970’s and the 2000’s. Traders should expect sideways price action with big rallies and selloffs for the next 10 years.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Reversing up from expanding triangle, but more trading range likely</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-reversing-up-in-expanding-triangle-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-11-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart reversing up in expanding triangle.png\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke above the 2 year trading range in February but reversed violently down. It broke strongly below in March and is now violently reversing up. Since it is now back to the middle of the range, it is fairly neutral.<p>The bulls hope that this rally is the start of a reversal up from an expanding triangle bottom. Their target is a new high.<p>But the collapse was extremely strong. That makes it likely that this rally will not continue to the high without first entering a small trading range for several weeks.<p>In fact, after a 34% selloff, the bulls will probably need at least a couple years before they can reach the old high. And even then, because of how extreme the 2017 buy climax was, the Emini will probably be unable to go much above the old high for possibly the rest of the decade.<h3>Slightly more rally likely</h3><p>Last week was a big bull bar in a big 3 week rally. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices next week. The 20 week EMA is a magnet above.<p>But traders know that legs in trading ranges typically stall once they reach the middle third of the range. Consequently, they expect at least a few sideways weeks to begin within the next couple of weeks.<p>After that, at test down to the bottom of the range around the December 2018 low or the March low is more likely than a continuation up to the prior all-time high.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Emini wedge rally to 50 percent retracement of coronavirus crash</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-reversing-up-from-spike-and-channel-bear-trend-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-11-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart reversing up from spike and channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied strongly for 3 weeks. By going above 2706, it is no longer 20% below the high. Consequently, it is no longer in a bear market.<p>Furthermore, it is now more than 20% above the low. Many traders therefore believe the Emini is back in a bull market.<p>But Big Down, Big Up, creates Big Confusion. Confusion is one of the hallmarks of a trading range. Traders should expect a bear leg in the developing trading range to begin soon.<p>This week went above the 50% retracement level of the 2 month bear trend. The bulls hope that the V bottom reversal continues up to the March 3 high. That was the start of the parabolic bear channel. But given how far above the low that is, there will probably be a 2 week pullback first.<p>While there is not a clear wedge yet, the rally is beginning to develop wedge characteristics. That is an early sign that the bulls are getting hesitant and the bears are starting to short.<h3>Spike and Channel Bear Trend usually evolves into trading range</h3><p>Traders know that a reversal up from a Spike and Channel Bear Trend usually eventually tests the start of the bear channel. Then, the rally typically evolves into a trading range.<p>That target is probably too far to reach with this V bottom, given how strong the selloff was. Therefore, traders should expect a test down to the April 1 higher low or March 23 bear trend low first. At that point, the bulls will try again.<p>There is no top yet so the rally might continue for another week or two. However, the bulls will probably start taking profits and the bears will begin to sell now that the rally has retraced half of the bear trend.<h3>How far up will the V bottom rally go?</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-reversing-up-with-2-options-4.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-11-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart reversing up with 2 options\"></a></figure><p>There have been 3 strong selloffs over the past 26 months. In February 2018, there was a 10% selloff and then a strong rally. It was a wedge rally and it became a bull leg in what grew into a 6 month trading range.<p>The 20% collapse at the end of 2018 also led to a V bottom reversal. The rally grew into a bull trend. It lasted the entire year and the Emini made a new high.<p>What will happen this time? The rally has been strong, like the other 2 times. Also, the start of the parabolic wedge bear channel was the March 3 high. That is a magnet after a sell climax. Many bulls expect the rally to get there before there is more than a 3 day pullback.<p>But the stock market collapsed 34% in a short time. That is the most dramatic bear market since the 1929 Crash. Traders know that this is enough to make a V bottom reversal unlikely to grow into a bull trend. The bulls currently have only a 30% chance of a new high within the next 2 years.<h3>Trading range more likely than bull trend</h3><p>At the moment, there is a 70% chance of a test of the March low or the April 1 higher low before there is a new high. But when will that test down begin? There is a developing wedge shape to the rally. That often leads to a couple legs down. Traders still want a clearer top, especially since the 3 week bull channel is tight. This is a strong rally.<p>The parabolic bear channel began with the March 3 lower high. Traders know that a rally up from a Spike and Channel Bear Trend usually reaches to around the beginning of the bear channel. Even if it does, it will probably test down first.<p>Late in the March collapse, I said several times that there would be an extremely strong rally. It would be the start a V bottom reversal. But I said V bottoms reverse into bull trends only 20% of the time. They do so less often after crashes.<p>That is why I wrote that the V bottom rally would fail after a couple months and end up as a bull leg in what would become a trading range. This is similar to what happened in February 2018.<p>The 3 week rally is behaving the way I thought it would. I still expect the reversal up from the V bottom to fail. Traders should expect the Emini to enter a trading range, probably for the rest of the year. However, there is no top yet. The Emini will probably be sideways to up for at least another week or two.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

I said the rally should reach 2706, which is 20% down from the high, or possibly 2781, which is a 50% pullback.<p>It reach both last week. Many bulls will begin to take profits. In addition, the bears will begin to sell. There is now a wedge rally, which is good for the bears.<p>Thursday is a sell signal bar in the wedge at resistance. But it is only a doji and therefore a weak sell signal bar. Furthermore, the bull channel is tight. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices. Many bears will want a micro double top before selling.<h3>Probable bull leg in trading range and not bull trend</h3><p>The important point is that the 3 week rally is more likely a leg in what will be a trading range and not a resumption of the bull trend. Consequently, traders expect a lower high and a test down.<p>The Emini is now high enough for bulls to begin to sell out of their longs and for bears to begin to scale into shorts. Will a 2 week pullback begin this week? Maybe. If not, then soon.<p>Even though the Emini is entering the sell zone, there is no top yet. Therefore, traders expect at least slightly higher prices. The March 10 lower high is 2873.50. That is the next target for the bulls.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 9 points in the Globex session. Last week was a big bull bar on the weekly chart. The Emini has reversed up strongly for 3 weeks. This week will probably trade above last week’s high.<p>However, as I discussed over the weekend, this 3 week rally will probably fail within a couple of weeks and then begin a 2 week reversal down. But because the daily chart is in a tight bull channel, traders expect at least slightly higher prices. Therefore, bull trend days are more likely than bear trend days.<p>Traders know that the Emini is at a level where selling will increase. That will increase the amount of sideways trading. For example, Friday was a trading range day. Traders will be wary. They will look for reversals unless there is a strong, persistent breakout up or down.<h2>Thursday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trading-range-at-50-percent-retracement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-13.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range at 50 percent retracement\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from last Thursday.

That is a triangle following an expanding triangle. It broke above the bear trend line overnight. But so far, today is a bear bar. If it closes near its low, it will be a sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>A breakout from a Breakout Mode pattern has a 50% chance of failing. The bears want a reversal down to below the March low. But if today is only a minor pullbackk and the rally continues, they will try for a double top with the March 27 high.<p>If the bears are successful at turning the EURUSD down today, the bulls will try to form a double bottom with the April 6 low.<h3>Trading ranges resist breaking into trends</h3><p>A Breakout Mode pattern is a trading range. A trading range resists breaking out. Consequently, reversals are more likely than a breakout into a trend. Traders will sell reversals down and buy reversals up.<p>If today closes near its low, it would be a minor sell setup. If it closes near its high, it will be a continuation of the minor rally that began last week.<p>Last week was a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. Today triggered the buy by going above last week’s high. It is currently more likely that the EURUSD will continue up to the March 27 high than reverse down to the April 6 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above last week’s high overnight. That triggered a weekly buy signal.<p>It quickly reversed down to below Friday’s low. Today is now an outside down bar on the daily chart. If it closes near its low, it will be a sell signal bar for tomorrow. But, it reversed up over the past 2 hours.<p>Even though the EURUSD sold off for the past 6 hours, the bars were small. Most had prominent tails and most overlapped prior bars. The bear trend has been week.<p>Also, it reversed down from above last week’s high and up from below Friday’s low. These reversals and the weak bars on the 5 minute chart make a strong trend day unlikely. Traders have been scalping, looking for reversals.<p>Since the past 6 hours have been down, it has been easier to make money selling. But most of the bars have been sideways. Today will probably remain a small, scalping day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a small bull breakout at the end of the day. However, it failed to make a new high.<p>By going below Thursday’s low, the Emini triggered a minor sell signal today. There is a wedge top, but the shape is not good. Also, Thursday was a doji, which is a weak sell signal bar. Finally, the bull channel has been tight. Consequently, this selloff will probably only last 1 – 3 days. It might have ended today. Today is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>It is important to remember that the Emini has retraced 50% of the bear trend. The bear trend is strong enough to make this rally minor. The Emini is now in the sell zone. Traders should expect a test of the April 1 higher low before the end of May.<p>The Emini will probably remain in a trading range for the rest of the year. That means that tops and bottoms are usually not clear. Also, follow-through after strong legs up and down is typically disappointing. That is the nature of trading ranges.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is a Breakout Mode pattern. There was a small bull breakout at the end of the day and it continued overnight.<p>Yesterday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. Because it was a small bear doji candlestick, it is a weak signal bar. However, the rally on the daily chart has been strong. Traders expect at least a slightly higher prices before a 2 – 3 week test down to the April 1 higher low begins.<p>The Emini tested near the 2706 level again yesterday, but reversed up. That is 20% down from the high. If the Emini trades below it, the Emini will once again be back in a bear market. Regardless of whether it is above or below, it will probably be mostly sideways for several months.<h3>Possible wedge lower high</h3><p>As strong as the rally has been, today will be the 3rd leg up on the daily chart. Consequently, the rally will be a wedge pullback in a bear trend.<p>If the bears get a reversal down within a few days from above Thursday’s high, the bulls will start to take profits and the bears will sell more aggressively. Traders will expect a couple legs down to the April 1 higher low over the following few weeks.<p>The bulls want a strong break above Thursday’s high. That is also last week’s high. If they get it, traders will then expect the rally to continue up to the March 3 lower high before there is a 2 – 3 week selloff.<p>That March 3 high was the start of the parabolic wedge sell climax. It is a customary magnet for the 1st reversal up. Since it is so far above the low, it is more likely that the Emini will test down to the April 1 low before rallying to the March 3 high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The rally on the daily chart has been strong. Traders expect it to continue to above Thursday’s high either today or later this week.<p>The Emini is up 40 points in the Globex session. It is now testing the 2800 Big Round Number.<p>However, it has been sideways for most of the session. Furthermore, the rally has not yet broken above last week’s high. Therefore, this week is still an inside bar on the weekly chart.<p>If the bears continue to prevent a break above last week’s high, the bulls will be disappointed. They will then begin to sell out of their longs either above this week’s high or below this week’s low. Traders will then begin to think that a 2 – 3 week selloff to the April 1 higher low has begun.<p>But the 4 week rally is probably a bull leg in a trading range on the daily chart. Traders therefore believe that there will soon be a test down to the April 1 higher low. That increases the chance of a surprisingly big bear day within the next week or so.<p>However, rallies often end with buy climaxes. Therefore, there is also an increased chance of a big bull day at some point this week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That triggered a weekly buy signal. It is also breaking above the bear trend line of a month-long triangle and a 7 month diamond pattern.<p>But so far the breakout is small. Furthermore, the rally might be forming a small wedge. If there is a reversal down this week, traders will expect a test of the April 6 higher low.<p>At the moment, the EURUSD is likely to go at least a little higher. If today closes far above yesterday’s high, today will probably be a measuring gap. That gap would be between today’s close and yesterday’s high.

That is a Breakout Mode pattern. There was a small bull breakout at the end of the day and it continued overnight.<p>Yesterday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. Because it was a small bear doji candlestick, it is a weak signal bar. However, the rally on the daily chart has been strong. Traders expect at least a slightly higher prices before a 2 – 3 week test down to the April 1 higher low begins.<p>The Emini tested near the 2706 level again yesterday, but reversed up. That is 20% down from the high. If the Emini trades below it, the Emini will once again be back in a bear market. Regardless of whether it is above or below, it will probably be mostly sideways for several months.<h3>Possible wedge lower high</h3><p>As strong as the rally has been, today will be the 3rd leg up on the daily chart. Consequently, the rally will be a wedge pullback in a bear trend.<p>If the bears get a reversal down within a few days from above Thursday’s high, the bulls will start to take profits and the bears will sell more aggressively. Traders will expect a couple legs down to the April 1 higher low over the following few weeks.<p>The bulls want a strong break above Thursday’s high. That is also last week’s high. If they get it, traders will then expect the rally to continue up to the March 3 lower high before there is a 2 – 3 week selloff.<p>That March 3 high was the start of the parabolic wedge sell climax. It is a customary magnet for the 1st reversal up. Since it is so far above the low, it is more likely that the Emini will test down to the April 1 low before rallying to the March 3 high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The rally on the daily chart has been strong. Traders expect it to continue to above Thursday’s high either today or later this week.<p>The Emini is up 40 points in the Globex session. It is now testing the 2800 Big Round Number.<p>However, it has been sideways for most of the session. Furthermore, the rally has not yet broken above last week’s high. Therefore, this week is still an inside bar on the weekly chart.<p>If the bears continue to prevent a break above last week’s high, the bulls will be disappointed. They will then begin to sell out of their longs either above this week’s high or below this week’s low. Traders will then begin to think that a 2 – 3 week selloff to the April 1 higher low has begun.<p>But the 4 week rally is probably a bull leg in a trading range on the daily chart. Traders therefore believe that there will soon be a test down to the April 1 higher low. That increases the chance of a surprisingly big bear day within the next week or so.<p>However, rallies often end with buy climaxes. Therefore, there is also an increased chance of a big bull day at some point this week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That triggered a weekly buy signal. It is also breaking above the bear trend line of a month-long triangle and a 7 month diamond pattern.<p>But so far the breakout is small. Furthermore, the rally might be forming a small wedge. If there is a reversal down this week, traders will expect a test of the April 6 higher low.<p>At the moment, the EURUSD is likely to go at least a little higher. If today closes far above yesterday’s high, today will probably be a measuring gap. That gap would be between today’s close and yesterday’s high. It would increase the chance of a measured move up to the March 27 lower high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied overnight to above yesterday’s high.

The 4 week bull trend has been strong. Also, the 50 day simple moving average and the March 10 lower high are magnets above.<p>The bulls were hoping that the Emini reaches those targets. However, the overnight selloff reduces the chances. Also, the Emini entered the sell zone once it went above the 50% pullback level.<p>Traders have known that there would soon be a test down to the April 1 higher low starting soon. This is because they expect that the Emini will continue in a trading range for many months. The odds are high that every leg up in a trading range eventually reverses into a leg down and vice versa.<p>If today is the start of a reversal down, the 3 week rally would have 3 legs up. It would therefore be a wedge lower high. Traders would then expect at couple legs down to the April 1 higher low over the next few weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 75 points in the Globex session. It will gap down far below yesterday’s close and it might also gap below yesterday’s low. Yesterday would be a 1 day island top. Remember, the the April 1 low was part of a 3 day island bottom. Island tops and bottoms are common in trading ranges and they typically are minor reversal patterns.<p>Today will open with a big gap below yesterday’s close. The Emini will therefore be far below the average price (the EMA) on the 5 minute chart. When that is the case, there is an 80% chance of early trading range trading.<p>There are 4 common patterns in this Breakout Mode type of open. The bears will look to sell a double top or wedge top near the EMA, expecting a swing down. However, the bulls will want to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom for a swing up.<p>There is only a 20% chance of a strong trend from the open up or down. If there is one, down is slightly more likely than up because of the gap being down.<p>Day traders should always be ready for anything. However, they will most likely see a trading range open for the 1st hour or two. They should then look to trade one of the 4 patterns that I just mentioned.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-sell-climax-to-double-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-15.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax to double bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today is an outside down day.<p>I have said several times that the 1st breakout of the diamond pattern would have a 50% chance of failing. This is what a failure looks like.<p>The 2 week rally has been a small wedge. Today is now a sell signal bar for tomorrow. It will have a higher probability of beginning a move down to the April 6 higher low if today closes near its low and below yesterday’s low.<p>If instead today closes above yesterday’s low, it will be a weaker sell setup. And if it closes in the middle of the range, tomorrow will probably be sideways. The bulls would then still have a 50% chance of the rally continuing sideways to up for at least a few more days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off from above yesterday’s high to below yesterday’s low. The selloff has been in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. Day traders have only been selling, and many have been swing trading.<p>Because the trend has been strong, they have been selling for any reason. That includes selling at the market and at the low.<p>While there is no evidence that this is about to end, it is unlikely to continue all day. The bears have achieved their goal. They created an outside down day and they are triggering a wedge reversal.<p>Their goal will soon switch. Although they would like the trend to continue all day, they are much more interested at this point in keeping what they have already accomplished. They therefore will begin to take profits and then sell rallies.<p>If there is a 30 pip profit taking rally, which is likely, the bulls will start to buy reversals up from the low for scalps. The result of the bears selling rallies and bulls buying selloffs will be a trading range. That should begin within a couple hours. It will still probably be easier to make money as a bear all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trending-trading-range-day-and-doji-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day and doji day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

On the 5 minute chart, today was a trading range day. After a weak selloff on the open, the Emini went sideways. It reversed up but failed just below yesterday’s low. The day closed in the middle. It is a weak buy signal bar on the daily chart for tomorrow.<p>Traders should expect a test of the April 1 low by the end of May. It could come in April. They are deciding if today’s gap down after a 2 week wedge rally is the start of a 2 – 3 week test down.<p>Since the rally got near the 50 day simple moving average, it will probably have to get there before the selloff begins. It can reach it by going sideways or a little more up.<p>The bears need follow-through selling over the next few days to convince traders that they have regained control. If they do not get it, the odds will continue to favor at least slightly higher prices before the test of the April 1 low.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The selloff has been in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. Day traders have only been selling, and many have been swing trading.<p>Because the trend has been strong, they have been selling for any reason. That includes selling at the market and at the low.<p>While there is no evidence that this is about to end, it is unlikely to continue all day. The bears have achieved their goal. They created an outside down day and they are triggering a wedge reversal.<p>Their goal will soon switch. Although they would like the trend to continue all day, they are much more interested at this point in keeping what they have already accomplished. They therefore will begin to take profits and then sell rallies.<p>If there is a 30 pip profit taking rally, which is likely, the bulls will start to buy reversals up from the low for scalps. The result of the bears selling rallies and bulls buying selloffs will be a trading range. That should begin within a couple hours. It will still probably be easier to make money as a bear all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trending-trading-range-day-and-doji-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day and doji day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

On the 5 minute chart, today was a trading range day. After a weak selloff on the open, the Emini went sideways. It reversed up but failed just below yesterday’s low. The day closed in the middle. It is a weak buy signal bar on the daily chart for tomorrow.<p>Traders should expect a test of the April 1 low by the end of May. It could come in April. They are deciding if today’s gap down after a 2 week wedge rally is the start of a 2 – 3 week test down.<p>Since the rally got near the 50 day simple moving average, it will probably have to get there before the selloff begins. It can reach it by going sideways or a little more up.<p>The bears need follow-through selling over the next few days to convince traders that they have regained control. If they do not get it, the odds will continue to favor at least slightly higher prices before the test of the April 1 low.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini will probably be in a trading range all year. Island tops and bottoms are common in trading ranges. They are minor reversal patterns. If today gaps up, yesterday would be a 1 day island bottom.<p>The Emini is still in a Small Pullback Bull Trend on the daily chart. Yesterday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the daily chart. The bulls will try to break above yesterday’s high to trigger that buy signal. They expect the rally to go at least a little more sideways to up to test the 50 day simple moving average before a selloff begins.<p>The selloff might begin in April. It might have begun this week. But if today breaks above yesterday’s high, yesterday will be just a one day pullback in a 3 week Small Pullback Bull Trend. The Emini will then try to reach the next resistance. That is the March 10 lower high and the 50 day moving average.<p>Above that is the March 3 high of 3125.75. The Emini will get there at some point within the next year because that was the start of the parabolic wedge selloff on the daily chart. That is a reliable magnet.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 22 points in the Globex market. It is near yesterday’s high. Today will probably go above yesterday’s high. That will trigger a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. It would increase the chance of this rally reaching the 50 day moving average, which is already likely.<p>It is important to note that the past 4 days have had mostly trading range price action. Unless there is a strong breakout up or down, day traders will expect more of that again today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trending-trading-range-day-and-doji-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-16.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day and doji day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This results in a more symmetrical triangle, which will make more computers watch for a breakout within the next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had 2 legs down over the past 2 days following last week’s wedge top. That meets the minimum expectation for the bears. They bought back their shorts overnight when the EURUSD fell below yesterday’s low. The bulls bought as well.<p>The two lines of the triangle on the daily chart are converging and are now very close.

It closed near the high, which increased the chance of higher prices today. Today will probably gap up big because it is up 73 points in the Globex session. Also, the daily chart is still in a Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>Since the rally has had 3 legs up on the daily chart, it is a wedge. However, there has been no clear top nor a strong reversal down. Consequently, the odds continue to favor at least slightly higher prices. It will probably open today around the next targets, which are the 50 day moving average and the March 10 lower high.<p>As strong as the rally has been, it is still probably a leg in a trading range. Traders expect at least a 2 week test down at some point in May. Since the rally has been very strong, traders will buy the pullback.<p>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important. This is particularly true in the final hour.<p>With today likely to gap up, the weekly targets are the 20 week EMA and the high of the week. On the downside, if today sells off, the open of the week and the 50% pullback of the 2 month bear trend are potential magnets below.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 73 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap up.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the average price on the 5 minute chart (the 20 bar EMA). Traders do not want to pay a price that is far above average unless the early bars are very strong.<p>When there is a big gap up, there is only a 20% chance of a strong trend up or down on the open. More often, the Emini goes sideways for an hour or two until it gets closer to the EMA. The bulls will then look to buy a reversal up from around the EMA. They want to see either a wedge bottom or a double bottom.<p>Trading ranges also have sell setups. The bears will look for a wedge rally or a double top if there is an opening trading range.<p>If there is a trading range open, which is likely, that means there is trading range price action. That reduces the chance that the day will become a strong trend day. Therefore, once a trend begins, traders will expect it to evolve into a trading range or have a reversal later in the day.<p>If there is going to be a trend, up is slightly more likely than down because the big gap is up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trading-range-day-with-big-swing-trades.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-17.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with big swing trades\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday’s breakout was small and today so far has a bull body. This is a weak breakout. Remember, a triangle is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail. This looks like a failed bear breakout.<p>But the reversal up is weak as well. That increases the chance that the triangle will evolve into a simple trading range. The EURUSD will still be in Breakout Mode.<p>Traders want to see either a strong rally to above the March 27 high or a strong selloff to below the March 23 low before they conclude that a trend might be underway.<p>Even then, most breakout attempts fail. I have been saying this for 2 years. There have been countless strong rallies and selloffs. Every time there was an attempt at beginning a trend, I said that a reversal was more likely.<p>Markets have inertia. They have a strong tendency to continue to do what they have been doing.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to below yesterday’s low and then reversed up. The 60 pip rally has been strong. Day traders have only been buying.<p>However, the EURUSD is now near the top of yesterday’s trading range. Also, while the rally has been relentless for 4 hours, the bars have been small. That increases the chance that the EURUSD will begin to go sideways. But unless there is at least a 20 pip selloff, day traders will continue to only buy.<p>Can the EURUSD reverse back down again today? That is unlikely after a reasonably strong reversal up from a bear breakout on the daily chart. The best the bears will probably get is a 30 pip pullback today. Today will probably continue up or enter a trading range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-lower-low-and-then-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low and then higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It closed near the high, which increased the chance of higher prices today. Today will probably gap up big because it is up 73 points in the Globex session. Also, the daily chart is still in a Small Pullback Bull Trend.<p>Since the rally has had 3 legs up on the daily chart, it is a wedge. However, there has been no clear top nor a strong reversal down. Consequently, the odds continue to favor at least slightly higher prices. It will probably open today around the next targets, which are the 50 day moving average and the March 10 lower high.<p>As strong as the rally has been, it is still probably a leg in a trading range. Traders expect at least a 2 week test down at some point in May. Since the rally has been very strong, traders will buy the pullback.<p>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important. This is particularly true in the final hour.<p>With today likely to gap up, the weekly targets are the 20 week EMA and the high of the week. On the downside, if today sells off, the open of the week and the 50% pullback of the 2 month bear trend are potential magnets below.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 73 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap up.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the average price on the 5 minute chart (the 20 bar EMA). Traders do not want to pay a price that is far above average unless the early bars are very strong.<p>When there is a big gap up, there is only a 20% chance of a strong trend up or down on the open. More often, the Emini goes sideways for an hour or two until it gets closer to the EMA. The bulls will then look to buy a reversal up from around the EMA. They want to see either a wedge bottom or a double bottom.<p>Trading ranges also have sell setups. The bears will look for a wedge rally or a double top if there is an opening trading range.<p>If there is a trading range open, which is likely, that means there is trading range price action. That reduces the chance that the day will become a strong trend day. Therefore, once a trend begins, traders will expect it to evolve into a trading range or have a reversal later in the day.<p>If there is going to be a trend, up is slightly more likely than down because the big gap is up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trading-range-day-with-big-swing-trades.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-17.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with big swing trades\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday’s breakout was small and today so far has a bull body. This is a weak breakout. Remember, a triangle is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail. This looks like a failed bear breakout.<p>But the reversal up is weak as well. That increases the chance that the triangle will evolve into a simple trading range. The EURUSD will still be in Breakout Mode.<p>Traders want to see either a strong rally to above the March 27 high or a strong selloff to below the March 23 low before they conclude that a trend might be underway.<p>Even then, most breakout attempts fail. I have been saying this for 2 years. There have been countless strong rallies and selloffs. Every time there was an attempt at beginning a trend, I said that a reversal was more likely.<p>Markets have inertia. They have a strong tendency to continue to do what they have been doing.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to below yesterday’s low and then reversed up. The 60 pip rally has been strong. Day traders have only been buying.<p>However, the EURUSD is now near the top of yesterday’s trading range. Also, while the rally has been relentless for 4 hours, the bars have been small. That increases the chance that the EURUSD will begin to go sideways. But unless there is at least a 20 pip selloff, day traders will continue to only buy.<p>Can the EURUSD reverse back down again today? That is unlikely after a reasonably strong reversal up from a bear breakout on the daily chart. The best the bears will probably get is a 30 pip pullback today. Today will probably continue up or enter a trading range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-lower-low-and-then-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low and then higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls are trying to reach the February close to erase the entire March selloff. The rally has a wedge shape, which means it is a buy climax. But traders will buy the 1st 2 – 4 week pullback.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>are at the apex of a triangle on the daily chart. There probably will be a test of the November low within a few months. This is true even if the bonds break above the triangle and test the March high 1st.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>chart is at the apex of a diamond pattern. It will probably break out withing a few weeks. There is a 50% chance of the breakout being up or down.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Trading range for remainder of the year</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bond-Futures-daily-candlestick-chart-at-apex-of-triangle-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-18.png\" alt=\"Bond Futures daily candlestick chart at apex of triangle after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures daily chart has been in a tight range for the past 4 weeks. This follows the most extreme buy climax in history.<p>When there is an extreme buy climax, the bulls take profits. That does not mean that the bears take control, although there sometimes is an immediate trend reversal down. It is more common for the bull trend to pause. The more extreme the buy climax, the longer the pause. The bulls want to see if the bears are strong enough to reverse the trend. If not, the bulls will buy again.<p>This buy climax was present on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. As a guide, traders expect at least 2 legs sideways to down over about 10 bars. Because there is a buy climax on the monthly chart, the sideways to down trading could last about a year.<h3>Daily chart is in a triangle</h3><p>The daily chart has been forming higher lows and lower highs since the March 9 high. It is therefore in a triangle.<p>A triangle is a Breakout Mode pattern. When a chart is in Breakout Mode, traders expect an eventual breakout to lead to a trend. But they know that the 1st breakout up or down fails 50% of the time.<p>It is important to understand that a chart cannot not be in a Breakout Mode pattern unless the probability of a successful bull breakout is the same as for a bear breakout. Think about this. If there was a 60% chance of a bull breakout, traders would not wait for the breakout. Why wait and buy higher when you know that it is going up?<p>Does a bull breakout above the triangle on the daily chart mean that there will be a rally to a new high? No. There is plenty of room up to the March high for a successful bull breakout to get near the old high without going above it. If it rallies to near the old high, the rally will probably reverse down and then form a bear leg in the developing yearlong trading range.<h3>Monthly chart has a tiny inside doji bar in April after a huge buy climax</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bond-Futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-small-doji-inside-bar-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-18-1.png\" alt=\"Bond Futures monthly candlestick chart has small doji inside bar after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>On the monthly chart, this month’s high is far below last month’s high. Also, its low is far above last month’s low. April is an inside bar. Additionally, its range is tiny compared to March’s.<p>Furthermore, it is currently near the open of the month. That makes it a doji bar at the moment, which is neutral. Finally, it is almost exactly in the middle of March’s range. This month is therefore as neutral as it could be after an extremely strong 3 month rally.<p>If this month remains an inside bar, it will be a Breakout Mode bar on the monthly chart in addition to the Breakout Mode pattern (a triangle) on the daily chart.<p>That means April will be both a buy signal bar and a sell signal bar for next month on the monthly chart. The bulls will see March as a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar in a strong bull trend. But the bears will see it as a sell signal bar for a reversal down from an extreme buy climax.<p>If the month closes near its high, a bull breakout will be more likely in May. The bears want it to close near its low. That would increase the chance of a bear breakout.<p>If it closes near the open, it will be a lower probability signal bar for both the bulls and bears. That would increase the chance of more buyers below its low and more sellers above its high.<h3>Trading range for the rest of the year</h3><p>Does it really matter how April looks once it closes in a couple weeks? Not really. The monthly chart is likely to be sideways to down for the next year. If it goes up for a couple months, it will then probably reverse down.<p>What happens if it begins to trade down? When there is a reversal down from a buy climax, the selling usually continues down to the bottom of the buy climax. That is the January low of around 154. But it could take a year to get there and it might go up a little first.<p>Also, if it gets there, the bulls will probably start to buy again. That would create at least a bounce for a few months.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Bear channel, but tight trading range so Breakout Mode</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-weekly-Forex-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range-in-bear-channel-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-18-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD weekly Forex candlestick chart in tight trading range in bear channel\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart has had dramatic reversals up and down over the past 5 weeks. There was an expanding triangle and then a triangle (I did not draw the lines this week). That is a diamond pattern, which, like all trading ranges, is a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>This week triggered a buy signal by going above last week’s high. Last week was a bull bar closing near its high. It formed a micro double bottom with the bar from 2 weeks earlier. Since this is taking place near the bottom of the 3 month range, the EURUSD is more likely to trade up than down over the next few weeks.<p>However, this week was a bear bar. Not only is that a bad entry bar for the bulls who bought above last week’s high, this week is a sell signal bar for next week. The bears see this week as forming a Low 2 bear flag with the Low 1 bear flag from 2 weeks ago.<p>Whenever there is both a credible buy and sell signal, the market is in a trading range and in Breakout Mode. There is a 50% chance of a swing down and a 50% chance of a swing up. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail.<h3>ioi Breakout Mode pattern on the monthly chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-monthly-Forex-candlestick-chart-in-ioi-breakout-mode-pattern-in-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-18-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD monthly Forex candlestick chart in ioi breakout mode pattern in bear channel\"></a></figure><p>This month’s low is above last month’s low and this month’s high is below last month’s high. April is therefore inside last month’s range. It is an inside bar. That is a breakout Mode bar.<p>Furthermore, March’s high was above February’s high and March’s low was below. March is therefore outside of February, and February is inside of March’s range.<p>With April within March’s range, these 3 bars have formed an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern. That is a more significant Breakout Mode pattern than simply April being an inside bar. It increases the chance of a trend up or down following the breakout.<p>The bears see April as a sell signal bar for a Low 2 bear flag. But the bulls see it as a High 2 buy signal bar at the end of a 2 year bear trend. If April ends up as a bear bar closing near its low, the odds of a bear breakout will go up. Conversely, if it is a bull bar closing near its high, the odds of a bull breakout in March go up. A small bull or bear body would increase the chance of another month or two of sideways trading.<h3>Where will a breakout go?</h3><p>Remember, the 1st breakout of a Breakout Mode pattern fails and reverses 50% of the time. This ioi pattern increases the chance of a breakout of the 7 – 9 month trading range and then a trend lasting for possibly a couple months.<p>If the bulls get their breakout, the will look for a rally to the September 2018 high. That is the start of the 20 month bear channel. A bear breakout will probably test the January 2017 bottom of the 2017 bull trend. It might continue down to par (1.00).<h2>Impact of the pandemic</h2><p>When the pandemic struck in February, traders were confident of one thing. They knew it would drastically change the behavior of consumers.<p>Since consumer spending is responsible for 70% of the GDP, companies would make less money or even lose money. The value of companies is based on earnings. If the total earnings of America’s companies was going to be less, the price of stocks had to fall.<p>No one knew how bad the unemployment and the reduced spending would be. But everyone knew the economy would be bad. It took a while for America to conclude that life will not get back to normal until there is a vaccine next year. I am a physician with some virology expertise, and I had been saying that from mid-February.<h3>The stock market leads the economy</h3><p>The stock market is actually a futures market. People buy stock based on what they think the price will be in the future. Therefore, the market typically goes down before there is a recession and up before a recession ends.<p>The market has rallied strongly over the past 4 weeks. This is because traders concluded that a 34% reduction in the stock market’s price was more than what was needed to account for the damage from the pandemic.<p>The market is now in search of a price that is appropriate. Traders concluded that the February high is too high and the March low is too low. Somewhere in the middle is just about right.<p>It will take many months to find the theoretically fair price. As traders become more confident of what the fair price is, the legs up and down will get smaller.<p>After many months of equilibrium, traders will become confident that there is no more significant risk of a 2nd or 3rd wave of infections and economic damage. Traders will begin to ignore the pandemic and then life will start to get back to normal, or at least a new normal. Once that happens, the bulls would then try to create a rally to a new high.<h3>The vaccine will probably work</h3><p>Traders want to know that a vaccine will work. Vaccines work for most viruses, but not all. HIV is an obvious example. It took decades to create a reasonably good treatment for people infected with HIV. A satisfactory treatment is one that helps the patient and greatly reduces the chance of spreading the virus to others.<p>For Covid-19, it would probably also take many years to develop a comparably effective treatment. A treatment without a vaccine would have the world living with the virus indefinitely and possibly forever. That dismal prospect would be a chronic weight on the economy.<h3>Remdesivir might help</h3><p>There was a report this week from my alma mater, the University of Chicago, concerning Gilead’s Remdesivir. They used it to treat 113 patients with severe disease and most were discharged within a week.<p>While it is good that the drug appears to reduce the death rate, it is not enough to make American life normal again. Being on one’s death bed and then surviving is better than not surviving. But who ever wants to be so sick that he is on a deathbed? That is not our normal life.<p>It is important to note that there are politics in everything, including medical research. I was a medical scientist decades ago and saw it for myself at many major medical centers. Also, there are statistical abnormalities that result in what appears to be a good result, but is actually just a coincidence. Doctors know this and therefore want to see similar results from several medical centers before being confident that a drug is truly helpful.<h3>What traders want from a vaccine</h3><p>Traders want a vaccine will prevent infection in a large percentage of the population. For example, the flu vaccine only works in about 70% of people who get vaccinated. People want a more reliable vaccine than that because Covid-19 is a more serious illness. Traders also want the protection to be permanent or last at least several years.<p>Viruses mutate. If they mutate enough, the old vaccine is ineffective. I would not be surprised if a coronavirus vaccine gets incorporated into the annual flu shot. That<p>Finally, traders want to be sure that a vaccine will not have horrible side effects. If it does, many will refuse to get vaccinated. The result will be lots of people choosing to risk getting sick and passing the infection to others. That would prolong the damage to the economy.<p>These uncertainties will be here for another year. That will probably keep the market sideways into 2021.<h3>But what if the pandemic is not the main problem?</h3><p>I have mentioned since late 2017 that the<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/trump-corporate-tax-cut-rally-might-be-january-barometer/#buy-climaxes-on-daily-weekly-monthly-charts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Emini was the most overbought in the 100 year history of the stock market</a>. I said that it would probably take a decade for the fundamentals to catch up to the high price.<p>That is what happened after the buy climaxes in the 1960’s and the 1990’s. Each led to about a decade of sideways trading. There were 50% selloffs and 100% rallies, but the market was in a trading range. The market sometimes made new highs, but they led to a reversal back down instead of a bull trend.<p>The stock market has been in a trading range for over 2 years. I suspect that it will probably continue in a range between 1800 and 3600 for the rest of the decade. I do think that there will be at least one more new high. It might even come next year. But the market will likely have a difficult time getting far above this year’s high for a long time.<p>What happens if the market rallies to 4,000 within a few years? That would indicate that the fundamentals had caught up to price. The odds of another bull trend at that point could be better than 50%. But, without that, there is a 60% chance that the 2 year trading range will continue for at least several more years.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong reversal up erasing March selloff</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-big-bull-inside-bar-after-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-18-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has big bull inside bar after sell climax\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;so far is a big bull bar in April. Its low is above the March low and its high is below the March high. April is therefore an inside bar.<p>It is important to note that March collapsed below the 10 year bull trend line and the 2 year trading range. It then reversed up dramatically. April is continuing that reversal up.<p>This is similar to what happened in January 2019. That, too, was a big bull inside bar following a collapse below a 1 year trading range. It was a buy signal bar and the start of a yearlong rally to a new all-time high.<h3>The importance of the February close</h3><p>The bulls want April to get back above the February close. It will then have erased the March sell climax. Furthermore, it will be a sign of strong bulls. Traders will conclude that the low is in, even if the Emini is sideways for the rest of the year.<p>We do not know yet if April will close on its high. If it has a prominent tail on top of its candlestick, traders would suspect that the bulls are slightly hesitant. That would reduce the chance of the rally continuing directly up to the old high.<p>The bulls are hoping that 2020 will be a repeat of 2019. But it will not be. It will probably be more like the rally in early 2018. While it was strong, it ended up as the 1st leg up in a 6 month trading range.<h3>Why is this different from last year?</h3><p>What are the differences that account for this conclusion? There are several. An obvious one is that the Emini fell 34% in 2 months. This is the most dramatic selloff since the Great Depression. That much selling makes a trading range for the next year more likely than a bull trend.<p>There are many trapped bulls who bought near the high who are desperate to exit if the rally gets near their entry price. Also, after such a strong selloff, the bears are eager to sell this rally. They know that the odds favor a test down within the next couple months.<p>In addition, the monthly chart had 2 consecutive big bear bars this time. That is more relentless selling than in late 2018. There was a bull bar in between the 2 big bear bars back then. That hesitation was a sign that the bears were not as determined as they could be. The bulls had less resistance in their reversal up.<h3>History makes a trading range likely</h3><p>Traders have to pay attention to history. What has the market done when it has sold off 30% in the past?<p>The low of the March selloff was 34% down from the high. Once a selloff falls 20%, there is a bear market. The final low typically is around 30% down from the high. This selloff has already met that objective. But the final low on average comes a year after the high. Therefore, there is a risk of a new low a year from now.<h3>V bottoms usually do not lead to bull trends</h3><p>A reversal up form a sell climax is typically very strong. Traders refer to it as a V bottom.<p>But it is important to understand that a V bottom only has a 20% chance of growing into a bull trend. The 1st leg up is typically minor, even if it is very strong. A minor reversal up in a bear trend is either a bear flag or a bull leg in what will become a trading range.<p>If there is a reversal back down, traders will then watch for a 2nd reversal up. That would then be a major trend reversal, which means it has a better chance of starting a bull trend. However, a major reversal still has only a 40% chance of growing into a bull trend. More often, it leads to a continuation of the trading range.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Rally getting near the 20 week EMA</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-big-bull-reversal-after-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-18-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has big bull reversal after sell climax\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied 30% over the past 4 weeks. That is incredibly strong. It is now testing the 20 week EMA.<p>After a 34% selloff, traders expect that this 1st leg up will be minor. In terms of the percentage gained, it has been major. But when traders talk about major and minor trend reversals, this one is likely to be minor. That means another leg in the 2 year trading range is more likely than a resumption of the 11 year bull trend.<p>A bull leg in a trading range eventually transitions into a bear leg. Traders expect the bear leg to begin within the next few weeks.<h3>Only minor reversal down</h3><p>The rally erased a lot of the damage from the 2 month crash. But the bulls will probably have a difficult time extending the current leg up much beyond April. This is because the bulls who bought well (near the March low) know the rally will pull back soon. They will want to take profits before there is much of a reversal down.<p>Then there are the bulls who bought poorly (near the February high). They will begin to sell out of their longs, relieved to have avoided a huge loss.<p>Some of the rally is caused by bears who sold poorly (near the March low) and are being squeezed out of painful, losing positions. Once the remaining shorts have exited, there will probably not be many traders left to buy at the high. Also, strong bears will begin to scale into shorts now that the rally has reached the 20 week EMA.<p>The increasing selling by both the bulls and the bears should soon overwhelm the buying by any traders left who are buying up here. The result will be a reversal back down.<p>After a strong rally like this, the minimum objective is a 2 week pullback. Another is a 50% retracement of the 4 week rally. At that point, traders will watch to see if the selloff is stalling and forming another higher low. If so, they will expect a test of the top of the current rally.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>V bottom wedge rally testing February close</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-rally-after-sell-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-18-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has wedge rally after sell climax\n\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied strongly in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for 4 weeks. It has retraced more than 50% of the 2 month bear trend. That is a common resistance level. It is now testing the 50 day moving average and the 20 week EMA.<p>Most importantly, the bulls are trying to get back to the February close. If they succeed, they will have completely erased the March collapse.<h3>How much higher before there is a pullback?</h3><p>The rally has had 3 legs up. It is therefore a wedge. A wedge rally usually begins to attract sellers. The bulls see it as a buy climax and they start to take profits. Also, the bears expect the profit-taking to lead to lower prices. They therefore begin to scale into shorts.<p>Like most wedges, this one does not have a perfect shape or a strong sell signal bar. Because the bull channel is tight, many bulls see the trend as strong. They therefore are continuing to buy. They are trying to reach the February close before taking profits.<p>The rally also might reach the March 3 lower high. That was the start of the parabolic wedge bear channel. It is a reliable magnet. The bulls will probably get there at some point in 2020. But it might be too far up to reach before there is a 2 – 3 week pullback.<p>Because this rally has been extremely strong, the bulls will buy the 1st pullback. That is true even if it falls all of the way to the April low. More likely, it will probably not fall much below a 50% retracement of the rally.<h3>Support and resistance are magnets</h3><p>There are 3 remaining magnets above. The obvious one is the all-time high. That may be out of reach for 2020.<p>The nearest one is the February close, which is near the 20 week EMA (on the weekly chart). That Emini should get there, maybe even next week.<p>Next is the March 3 lower high. That was the start of the parabolic wedge sell climax. The start of a bear channel typically eventually gets tested when a sell climax reverses up. But it might be too far above the bear trend low. There may be one or more 2 – 4 week pullbacks before the Emini can reach it.<p>The Emini is currently testing the resistance of the 50 day simple moving average and the March 10 lower high. Institutional traders watch 50, 100, 150, and 200 day simple moving averages. These averages therefore are often support or resistance. Traders will watch next week to see if the bears are able to create a reversal down.<h3>What to expect when there is a reversal down</h3><p>When a wedge rally reverses, it usually does so at resistance. If the Emini does reverse, traders will look for a couple legs down to support over the following 2 – 4 weeks.<p>One downside target is 2706. That is 20% down from the high. If the Emini falls below that level, it will be back in a bear market.<p>Below that is the March 31 high. That is the breakout point for the 2nd leg up. That should get tested during the pullback.<p>Less likely is the April 1 higher low. While the Emini will probably get there this year, it is now so far above that price to make it is unlikely to fall that far within the next couple months.<p>Traders should expect sideways to up trading for another week or two. Then, the Emini will probably pull back for a few weeks. After this strong of a rally, traders will buy the pullback.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is testing the March 10 lower high and the 50 day moving average. There is room to the 20 week EMA and that might be the next target. Also, the bulls would like to get back to the February close. They would then have erased the entire March collapse.<p>There is a wedge rally on the daily chart. That is a buy climax. The daily chart is also extremely overbought. Traders expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin soon.<p>Since the bull channel has been tight, the 1st reversal down might not fall far. However, traders should expect a pullback lasting at least a couple weeks to begin soon. Traders will buy the pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 54 points in the Globex session after Friday’s late, strong rally. That is disappointing for the bulls. Since disappointment is a sign of a trading range, the 4 week rally might be evolving into a trading range.<p>Most of the intraday trading last week was within trading ranges. Most days had at least 2 trends. Traders will therefore expect at least one reversal today.<p>Everyone knows that the daily chart is extremely overbought. That increases the chance of some bear trend days. But markets tend to continue to do what they have been doing. Traders expect that until the Emini is clearly doing something else.<p>A big gap down means that the Emini will open far below the 20 bar EMA. Traders do not like to sell far below the average price. Therefore, there is an 80% chance of trading range price action for the 1st hour or two. The bulls hope for a double bottom or wedge bottom. They bears will look for the Emini to get near the EMA and reverse down from a double top or a wedge rally.<p>When there is a big gap, there is a 20% chance of a strong trend from the open that lasts all day. When the big gap is down, a bear trend is slightly more likely than a bull trend.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-lower-low-and-then-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-20.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low and then higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-weak-breakout-below-triangle-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-20-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been in a tight trading range for a month within a bigger 8 month trading range. It is forming lower highs and higher lows. This is a triangle. It is following an expanding triangle. The pattern is now a diamond.<p>Any trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. When the market is at the apex of a triangle, the odds of a breakout coming soon go up. Traders are expecting a strong breakout up or down within the next couple of weeks. It is important to note that the 1st breakout of a Breakout Mode pattern fails half of the time.<p>The EURUSD broke below the bull trend line last week. It therefore is breaking below the triangle.<p>But the breakout has been small and Friday was a bull bar. This is not how successful breakouts typically begin. Consequently, traders are still waiting for a strong breakout up or down.<p>At least half of the time when there is a breakout of a Breakout Mode pattern, the market continues sideways. Since it is still in a trading range, it is still in Breakout Mode.<p>If the EURUSD continues sideways for a couple weeks, the current triangle will evolve into either a simple trading range or a triangle with different lines. It does not matter. Traders are still waiting for a strong breakout up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above Friday’s high overnight. That triggered a buy signal on the daily chart for a failed breakout below a triangle.<p>But, just as the breakout was weak, so is the reversal up. There were more sellers than buyers above Friday’s high.<p>The EURUSD rallied and then sold off overnight. Neither trend was strong. It has been sideways in a 15 pip range for the past 2 hours. That makes it difficult for day traders to make even a small scalp.<p>They will, however, look for reversals today after 3 sideways days. But, they know that there is an increased chance of a strong breakout up or down coming soon. They will be quick to switch to swing trading if there are 2 or 3 consecutive big trend bars.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-wedge-top-and-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Traders believe that the rally still might reach the 20 week EMA and the February close before reversing.<p>But the rally is a wedge and a buy climax.

That increases the chance of lower prices today.<p>The bulls would like the rally to reach the 20 week EMA and the February close. However, as strong as the Emini has been, the 4 week rally will probably be just a leg in a trading range that could last for the rest of the years. Consequently, traders should expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin by the end of the month.<p>It might have begun yesterday. If so, the bear leg will probably retrace at least half of the bull leg. For example it could get down to the gap above the 3 day island bottom or even to the April 1 higher low.<p>But even if it does, the daily chart will still be in a trading range. Traders will expect another bull leg after a 2 – 3 week selloff.<p>Most days over the past 2 weeks have had at least one reversal. Traders will expect that again today, even if today trends for several hours on the open. However, because a 2 – 3 week pullback will begin soon, there is an increased chance of one or more bear trend days this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 50 points in the Globex session. There will be a big gap down on the daily chart. When there is a big gap, the Emini is far below the EMA on the 5 minute chart. The bears do not want to sell far below the average price unless the early bars are much more bearish than average.<p>Big breakouts often reverse. The bulls want a series of big bull bars on the open. That would increase the chance of a big bull trend day.<p>However, a strong trend up or down right from the open happens only 20% of the time when there is a big gap. More often, there are one or more reversals and the Emini enters a trading range for the 1st hour or two. The bulls hope for a wedge bottom or a double bottom, and then a trend up. The bears like to sell near the average price. They want a double top or a wedge top near the EMA.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-wedge-top-and-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-21.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-weak-breakout-below-triangle-and-now-double-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-21-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weak breakout below triangle and now double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been sideways for 8 months. It is therefore in Breakout Mode. Last week, it broke below a triangle. However, the breakout has stalled.<p>The bulls are now trying to create a small double bottom. If today closes on its high, it will have a bull body. It would then be a buy signal bar for tomorrow. Traders will conclude that the bear breakout failed.<p>The EURUSD has been in a tight trading range for 4 days at the apex of the triangle. The bars and bodies have been small. That is a sign of complacency and not tension. This is very different from several weeks ago when the bodies were big. There was much more energy and the moves were bigger.<p>These small days with prominent tails do not typically instantly change into big days. Therefore, although the EURUSD is at the apex of a triangle, it does not look like there will be a big move today or tomorrow. There will probably be a transition to bigger bodies over the course of 2 to 3 days before there is a breakout.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low overnight. That triggered a Low 1 sell signal on the daily chart. But because there is no energy on the daily chart, there have not been many sellers so far below yesterday’s low. The 5 minute chart has been in a 30 pip range for the past 10 hours. Day traders have been scalping small reversals.<p>This overnight trading range is following a brief breakout below yesterday’s low. The bears want a resumption of that earlier overnight bear trend. They would like the range to expand and for the day to close on its low. Today would then be a relatively good day for the bears on the daily chart. It would increase the chance that the bear breakout below the triangle is succeeding.<p>Alternatively, if the bulls can get a 40 – 50 pip rally in the US session, today would be a reversal day. That would make traders conclude that the bear breakout has failed.<p>What is most likely? Markets resist change. Day traders will continue to look for reversals today unless there is a strong breakout up or down. But if there is, there would be an increased chance of follow-through tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bear-trend-and-then-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That is 20% down from the high. It reversed up from a lower low major trend reversal and finished the day in the middle of the range.<p>The Emini has probably begun a 2 – 3 week pullback. If so, it should retrace about half of the rally on the daily chart. A reasonable target zone for a higher low is between 2500 and 2600. Traders expect it to fall in 2 or more legs because of the wedge top. Therefore, it could bounce to around 2800 before continuing down. Traders will sell rallies until the Emini falls down to that buy zone.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is 20% down from the high. If the Emini falls below that price, it will be back in a bear market. That should happen within a week or so.<p>However, the wedge top on the daily chart and 60 minute chart should get at least 2 legs down. It is possible that yesterday ended a brief 1st leg down. If so, the Emini could bounce to around 2800 before beginning the 2nd leg down.<p>That 2nd leg down will probably retrace about half of the rally. It might even reach April 1 higher low. A reasonable target is between 2500 and 2600 within a few weeks.<p>Traders should expect Emini to remain in a trading range for the rest of the year. Last week might be the top of the current leg up. If it is not, the top will likely not be much higher. The odds favor a test down to around 2500 within a few weeks. Traders will look to sell rallies, but they will then buy a higher low around 2500.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 34 points in the Globex market. I have been saying that there will probably be at least a couple legs down to below 2600 on the daily chart over the next few weeks.<p>Traders are wondering if the selloff has begun. Because there is a wedge top at resistance on the daily chart and consecutive bear days, there is better than a 50% chance that it has.<p>However, the daily chart will probably be in a trading range all year. When that is the case, legs up and down have bad follow-through, which means traders expect reversals every few days. Also, there will be more trading range days on the 5 minute chart.<p>Yesterday began to reverse up from a major trend reversal on the 5 minute chart. That reversal continued overnight, even though it is still small. It might continue again today, but there will probably be sellers around 2800, if the Emini gets there this week.<p>Because the daily chart is probably in a bear leg, traders expect lower highs and lows. Consequently, even if the Emini bounces for a day or two, the swing down will probably continue for a couple weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bear-trend-and-then-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-22.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend and then trading range.png\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It broke below a triangle on the daily chart last week.<p>However, it has entered a 5 day tight trading range. Traders are deciding if the breakout below the triangle will succeed or fail.<p>This 5 day range is a smaller Breakout Mode pattern. Every Breakout Mode pattern has both a reasonable buy and sell setup. The past 4 days have both a micro double top and a micro double bottom.<p>The bears want tomorrow to break below today’s low. That would be a resumption of the breakout below the triangle. They then want the selloff to continue to below the March low.<p>The bulls want the breakout above yesterday’s high to accelerate back into and then above the triangle. Traders would then conclude that the bear breakout failed and the bull breakout was beginning. They then want a strong rally to above the March 27 high and then the March 3 high.<p>The bars and bodies have been small for 4 days. There is no energy. But the apex of a triangle is often an area where the market begins to trend. But traders want to see a series of big, strong trend bars. Until they do, they will continue to bet on quiet trading.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market triggered a micro double bottom buy signal overnight by going above yesterday’s high. However, the breakout was small. Also, the day’s range is small. Day traders are scalping for 10 pips, looking for reversals.<p>Everyone knows that the market is in Breakout Mode. That increases the chance of a trend beginning soon. But until traders begin to see a series of big trend bars and big bodies, they will continue to look for small moves and reversals.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-channel-but-reversed-and-formed-doji-candlestick.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel but reversed and formed doji candlestick\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a wedge bull flag and an opening reversal up from near the EMA. It led to a bull channel and a test above 2800. It collapsed into the close to back near the open. Today was a doji bar on the daily chart.<p>The Emini should soon begin a 2 – 3 week pullback from the wedge top on the daily chart. However, it might make one more new high before the pullback to below 2600 begins. The bulls will buy the pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is 20% down from the high. If the Emini falls below that price, it will be back in a bear market. That should happen within a week or so.<p>However, the wedge top on the daily chart and 60 minute chart should get at least 2 legs down. It is possible that yesterday ended a brief 1st leg down. If so, the Emini could bounce to around 2800 before beginning the 2nd leg down.<p>That 2nd leg down will probably retrace about half of the rally. It might even reach April 1 higher low. A reasonable target is between 2500 and 2600 within a few weeks.<p>Traders should expect Emini to remain in a trading range for the rest of the year. Last week might be the top of the current leg up. If it is not, the top will likely not be much higher. The odds favor a test down to around 2500 within a few weeks. Traders will look to sell rallies, but they will then buy a higher low around 2500.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 34 points in the Globex market. I have been saying that there will probably be at least a couple legs down to below 2600 on the daily chart over the next few weeks.<p>Traders are wondering if the selloff has begun. Because there is a wedge top at resistance on the daily chart and consecutive bear days, there is better than a 50% chance that it has.<p>However, the daily chart will probably be in a trading range all year. When that is the case, legs up and down have bad follow-through, which means traders expect reversals every few days. Also, there will be more trading range days on the 5 minute chart.<p>Yesterday began to reverse up from a major trend reversal on the 5 minute chart. That reversal continued overnight, even though it is still small. It might continue again today, but there will probably be sellers around 2800, if the Emini gets there this week.<p>Because the daily chart is probably in a bear leg, traders expect lower highs and lows. Consequently, even if the Emini bounces for a day or two, the swing down will probably continue for a couple weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bear-trend-and-then-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-22.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend and then trading range.png\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-micro-double-top-and-bottom-after-triangle-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-22-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex micro double top and bottom after triangle breakout\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market has been in a trading range for 8 months and it continues to be in breakout Mode. It broke below a triangle on the daily chart last week.<p>However, it has entered a 5 day tight trading range. Traders are deciding if the breakout below the triangle will succeed or fail.<p>This 5 day range is a smaller Breakout Mode pattern. Every Breakout Mode pattern has both a reasonable buy and sell setup. The past 4 days have both a micro double top and a micro double bottom.<p>The bears want tomorrow to break below today’s low. That would be a resumption of the breakout below the triangle. They then want the selloff to continue to below the March low.<p>The bulls want the breakout above yesterday’s high to accelerate back into and then above the triangle. Traders would then conclude that the bear breakout failed and the bull breakout was beginning. They then want a strong rally to above the March 27 high and then the March 3 high.<p>The bars and bodies have been small for 4 days. There is no energy. But the apex of a triangle is often an area where the market begins to trend. But traders want to see a series of big, strong trend bars. Until they do, they will continue to bet on quiet trading.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market triggered a micro double bottom buy signal overnight by going above yesterday’s high. However, the breakout was small. Also, the day’s range is small. Day traders are scalping for 10 pips, looking for reversals.<p>Everyone knows that the market is in Breakout Mode. That increases the chance of a trend beginning soon. But until traders begin to see a series of big trend bars and big bodies, they will continue to look for small moves and reversals.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-channel-but-reversed-and-formed-doji-candlestick.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel but reversed and formed doji candlestick\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a wedge bull flag and an opening reversal up from near the EMA. It led to a bull channel and a test above 2800. It collapsed into the close to back near the open. Today was a doji bar on the daily chart.<p>The Emini should soon begin a 2 – 3 week pullback from the wedge top on the daily chart. However, it might make one more new high before the pullback to below 2600 begins. The bulls will buy the pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday’s rally retraced half of this week’s selloff. However, the Emini collapsed at the end of the day and the day was a doji bar on the daily chart. Traders should expect the Emini to pull back to between 2500 and 2600 within a few weeks.<p>It is important to know that it is common for the 1st reversal down from a wedge top to fail. Consequently, the Emini might rally to above last week’s high before beginning its 2 – 3 week correction.<p>Because the 5 week rally has been strong, traders should expect buyers to come back at around halfway down, between 2500 and 2600. Furthermore, they should expect a trading range for the remainder of the year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 18 points in the Globex session. It will probably open near yesterday’s high. The bulls want April to get above the February close. It would then have completely erased the March selloff.<p>Because the 2 month rally has been so strong, the bulls have a reasonable chance of achieving their goal. Traders will be ready to buy a strong breakout above 2800.<p>But traders expect the bulls to give up soon. They know that the rally is probably a leg in a yearlong trading range and not a resumption of the bull trend. If they give up, there will be one or more big bear trend days. That is how bear legs typically begin.<p>Since most days over the past 2 weeks have at least one trend up and one trend down, day traders will continue to look for reversals.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-channel-but-reversed-and-formed-doji-candlestick.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-23.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel but reversed and formed doji candlestick\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bears are hoping that this is a resumption of the March 23 bear trend. They want a series of bear bars to continue to far below the March 23 low and then down to par (1.0).<p>But look at the bodies in the legs down. They were very big in the leg down to the March 23 low, and fairly big in the leg down to the April 6 low. Also, both legs had many consecutive big bear bodies.<p>However, the selloff from the April 15 high had only 2 bear bars. Both were smaller and had prominent tails below. Finally, the bear breakout of the past 2 days is even smaller.<p>Traders see that the attempts to sell off are getting weaker. That will make bears less interested at selling at the bottom of a leg down. Furthermore, the bulls will begin to buy.<p>This is trading range price action. It reduces the chance that the 2 week selloff is a resumption of the March 23 bear trend.<p>It is important to note that the daily chart has been in a trading range for 8 months. Trading ranges resist breaking out. There have been many strong legs up and down. Each reversed and the trading range continued.<p>Traders expect this bear breakout to fail and reverse. But there is no sign of a reversal yet.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market continued its 2 day selloff overnight. But the bars have been small and there have rarely been more than a couple consecutive big bear bars. This selloff lacks conviction. Traders expect it to end today or tomorrow.<p>When a bear trend ends, the chart evolves either into a trading range or it reverses into a bull trend. Over the past 6 hours, the bars look like they are entering a trading range. Day traders have been scalping, expecting reversals.<p>Since today broke below a higher low (April 6) on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of a trend up or down. If the trend was going to be down, it probably would have begun soon after the breakout many hours ago. Therefore, if there is going to be a trend, up is more likely. However, there is so little energy that traders will continue to scalp unless there is a surprising big move up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-parabolic-wedge-and-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge and bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was another failed test of the 50 day moving average.<p>After collapsing to a new low, it entered a trading range. Today was a trending trading range day and it closed on its low. It is a sell signal bar for tomorrow on the daily chart.<p>The bears have a credible wedge top. Today was a lower high. Traders expect a 2 – 3 week selloff to below 2600. It might have already begun, but there might be one more push up to a new April high first.<p>This week so far is an inside bar on the weekly chart. That makes is a High 1 buy signal bar for next week. But the rally is climactic and the 20 week EMA is just above. If next week is higher, the rally will probably fail at around the 20 week EMA.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. Therefore, the open of the week might be a magnet again today.<p>It also reversed down from the 50 day moving average for the 3rd time this week. Consequently, traders see that as a magnet as well.<p>Yesterday is a sell signal bar for today on the daily chart. The bears are hoping that a 2 – 3 week selloff to below 2600 has begun. However, there might be one more push to a new April high first.<p>So far, this week in an inside bar on the weekly chart. If it remains an inside week, this week will be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the weekly chart for next week.<p>After a 5 bar bull micro channel on the weekly chart, the odds favor at least slightly higher prices. For example, the 20 week EMA is just above. But there will probably be sellers above this week’s high at around the 20 week EMA.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 27 points in the Globex session. That is a sign that traders are still paying attention to the open of the week and the 50 day moving average. Both could be magnets again today.<p>Yesterday was a bear channel on the 5 minute chart. Bear channels typically eventually have bull breakouts. Traders see them as bull flags.<p>If the Emini opens where it is now, it will be at the top of the channel. Also, with the magnets above, it will probably trade up to those magnets today.<p>The bulls want the week to have a bear body on the weekly chart. This week would then be a more reliable buy signal bar for a High 1 bull flag. That would make higher prices likely next week. The 20 week EMA is a magnet above for next week.<p>The bulls would prefer the week to close on its high. However, that might be too far above to get there today. If the bulls decide that it is unreachable, today might again oscillate around the open of the week and the 50 day moving average.<p>The overnight reversal up toward important magnets make a bear trend day unlikely. Since most days over the past 2 weeks have been trading range days, that is what traders expect again today. The open of the week could be an important magnet in the final hour if the Emini is within 10 – 20 points of it.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-parabolic-wedge-and-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-24.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This follows 2 strong rallies in March. If today closes near its high, it would be a good buy signal bar for a higher low major trend reversal.<p>Also, since the 2 legs down from the March 27 high are forming a bull flag, this would additionally be a High 2 buy signal. A strong bull close today would make higher prices likely for the next couple weeks.<p>It is important to remember the point that I have made during every rally and selloff for 2 years. There is no strong trend. Traders expect every breakout attempt up and down to fail within a few weeks. They continue to look for reversals. This is a good candidate for the end of a 4 week selloff and the start of a 2 – 4 week rally,<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up from below yesterday’s low overnight. It is now almost back to last week’s low.<p>Remember, last week was a Low 2 sell signal bar on the weekly chart. One goal for the bulls today is to get this week to close back above last week’s low.<p>That is around the midpoint of this week. If they get the week to close above its midpoint, the week would be slightly more bullish than bearish, even with a bear body.<p>The overnight 80 pip rally has been in a tight bull channel. Day traders have only been buying. They will continue to buy for swings and scalps today. If there is a 30 pip pullback, some will begin to sell for scalps as well.<p>After a strong reversal up with good context on the daily and weekly charts, a bear trend is unlikely today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trading-range-open-and-then-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range open and then small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bears were unable to trigger the sell signal on the daily chart by breaking below last week’s low. Instead, the bulls rallied in a Small Pullback Bull Trend to above the open of the week. Today is now a High 1 buy signal bar for Monday.<p>On the weekly chart, this week is also a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for next week. Since the 20 week EMA is an important magnet and is nearby, the Emini will probably get there next week.<p>Because the buy climax on the daily and weekly charts is extreme, traders expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to below 2600 to begin within a few weeks.

There is a wedge top on the daily chart. But there are High 1 bull flag buy signals on both the daily and weekly charts. There will probably be one more brief leg up to the 20 week EMA before the selloff begins.<p><strong>Crude oil</strong>had an extreme sell climax last week. It might have to go sideways for a long time before there is much of a reversal up.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is near the bottom of a 3 month trading range. It will probably begin to reverse up for 2 – 3 weeks within a couple weeks.<h2><strong>Crude oil futures monthly chart:</strong><br>Reversal up from extreme sell climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Crude-oil-month-candlestick-chart-in-buy-climax-at-wedge-bottom-and-measured-move-target-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-25.png\" alt=\"Crude oil month candlestick chart in buy climax at wedge bottom and measured move target\"></a></figure><p>The monthly chart of crude oil has been in a bear trend for 12 years. This year’s selloff is the 3rd leg down from the 2008 high. This month reversed up strongly after breaking below the bear channel.<p>Furthermore, the low was a measured move down from the height of the 2015 – 2020 trading range. Finally, the low was from single digits. Ten dollars is an important Big Round Number and therefore psychological support.<p>This week is a reasonable candidate for the end of the current leg down. A bear trend ends when no one is left to sell at the low. The bears see that it is getting too easy to sell at the low. Good fill, bad trade. Too many buyers down there. They conclude that they need to sell higher and therefore stop selling near the low.<p>Additionally, at the bottom of a sell climax, the bears have huge profits. Since their stop is far above, they become eager to reduce their risk. They look for a sell climax at support and then take profits. That reduces their position size, which means their risk is less.<p>The bulls see the reversal up and they begin to buy. The result is a sharp short covering rally. For example, the May contract rallied $50 in its final 24 hours. Also, the June contract went up more than 100% in 24 hours this week.<h3>What happens after a sell climax?</h3><p>When the bears take profits, they want to be confident that the bear trend has not become a bull trend. At a minimum, they want to see at least 2 attempts at a trend reversal up. After those 2 legs up, they will begin to sell again if they think the rally is failing.<p>That means that the minimum rally will have at least a couple legs up and last at least 10 days. That is about 2 weeks. It could be much more, but usually not much less.<p>About 20% of the time, when there is a reversal up from a sell climax, the V bottom reversal grows into a bull trend. What usually happens is that the rally has a couple legs up. Traders then look for a resumption of the bear trend. If that 2nd selloff reverses up again, there is a 40% chance of it growing into a bull trend. More often, there are additional legs up and down and the bear trend evolves into a trading range.<p>Every trading range always has both buy and sell signals. But crude oil is unlikely to fall much below $10. That means there will eventually be a bull trend.<p>However, the trading range could last many months and possibly years before a significant bull trend begins. If the range is tight, traders call that a “dead money” market. There is little profit potential and many traders will choose to trade other markets.<p>Traders should expect crude oil to be a trader’s market for a long time. They will buy low, sell high, and take quick profits, betting on a trading range and against a trend.<h2>Crude oil daily chart: Fell below zero this week!</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/crude-oil.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-25-1.png\" alt=\"crude oil traded negative \"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the May futures contract expired on Tuesday at $10.01. What is noteworthy is that it traded down to far below zero on Monday. It closed on Monday at -$37.63 a barrel. That means that at that moment, the oil producers were willing to pay 37.63 to anyone willing to take the oil off their hands. They had determined that it was better financially to pay someone to take the crude oil than it was for them to keep it.<p>There are many factors involved. An obvious one is that they clearly did not have the ability to store it because all of their storage tanks were full.<p>Another important factor is that taking crude oil from below the surface of the earth is not the same as getting water from a faucet. You cannot instantly turn it off and then on. If that were the case, they would have done it.<h3>Why don’t the oil producers cut the supply of oil?</h3><p>There are two primary reasons for the oversupply. One is you. How many miles have you driven over the past couple months? Compare that to last year at this time. Consumption is much less.<p>The other reason is less certain and it has to do with Saudi Arabia and Russia. The news says they are squabbling over reducing supply. It is being reported that they cannot come to an agreement about cuts that would be big enough to raise prices. Okay, fair enough.<h3>Follow the money</h3><p>Then there is the uncertain part of it. That has to do with intent. It would benefit both countries if the US crude oil production was severely curtailed. One way that could happen is if lots of US oil producers ceased to exist. That could happen if oil prices stay this low for several months.<p>Why wouldn’t the Saudi and Russian oil companies go bankrupt as well? Because they are effectively owned by their governments and those governments will not let that happen.<p>Saudi Arabia and Russia could quickly make the price go up by greatly cutting supply. Why are they not doing that when the low prices are also hurting their economies? It must be that they see the low oil prices as benefiting them in the long run.<p>This is an old fashioned price war. Those wars are fought to drive a competitor out of business. Short-term pain for long-term gain. Once the competitor is gone, you get his market share and you are free to greatly raise the price without the fear of competition.<p>Saudi Arabia denies that this is their motive. Trump is best friends with Putin, and it is unimaginable that a best friend would ever be so nefarious. But if you follow the money, the path leads to this conclusion, despite the denials.<h3>Where are Washington and the media?</h3><p>What is surprising to me is that I haven’t heard anything bold coming out of Washington about fighting back. A price war is an actual form of war, and it therefore requires a strong defense. For example, the Fed says it is willing to print infinite dollars to save the economy. Why hasn’t the Secretary of Energy said that the Army Corps of Engineers will build infinite oil storage tanks to fight back?<p>I really don’t understand why I haven’t heard any bold statement from Washington to the effect that the Saudis and Russians have crossed a line and that our government would do whatever is necessary to defend our interests. In part, it is because the pandemic is consuming everyone’s attention. But what is happening to oil is very important, and our government is failing to address it.<p>There has been some talk about paying US oil producers to stop producing, like grain incentives, but the idea does not appear to be gaining traction.<p>The press is ignoring the problem. I assume it is a combination of the pandemic and schadenfreude. Energy has done many things over the years that have angered environmentalists and the media. Maybe the media is quietly enjoying hearing the powerful voice of the fossil fuel industry become a lot quieter.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Breaking below Low 2 bear flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-high-2-bull-flag-after-Low-2-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-25-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has high 2 bull flag after Low 2 bear flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart has been in a bear channel for 2 years. Channels often spend a lot of time in trading ranges. The EURUSD had been sideways for 8 months. It formed an expanding triangle into March and a contracting triangle over the past 7 weeks. The triangle is easier to see on the daily chart.<p>This is a diamond pattern. Diamond patterns and triangles are simply types of trading ranges. Every trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. That means that the probability of a successful breakout is about the same for the bulls and for the bears. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-dailly-candlestick-chart-has-high-2-bull-flag-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-25-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart has high 2 bull flag and higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>On the daily chart, the past 2 weeks have broken below the triangle. This corresponds to the breakout below the Low 2 bear flag on the weekly chart.<p>However, the breakout has been weak. Friday was a bull day and therefore a buy signal bar. The bulls see Friday as forming a higher low major trend reversal. In addition, it is the end of 2 legs down from the March 27 rally. There, it is also a buy signal bar for a big High 2 bull flag.<p>But the 2 week selloff has been in a tight bear channel. This is therefore a weaker buy setup. Most bulls will want at least a micro double bottom or a surprisingly big bull bar before concluding that a 2 – 3 week leg up is beginning. However, the odds favor higher prices beginning within 2 weeks.<p>Small sideways bar with prominent tails over the past 2 weeks is a sign of complacency. It reduces the chance of a big move up or down next week.<h3>Will the bears get a test of par (1.0)?</h3><p>The bears want the breakout to continue down below the March low. If the bears get a couple consecutive closes below that low, traders will look for a break below the January 2017 low of 1.0340 and then a test of par (1.0).<p>But it is important to remember that there have been many breakouts and strong legs up and down for 2 years. Every one of them led to a reversal instead of a trend.<p>Traders therefore believe that this week’s breakout will not get far. They expect a reversal up from above the March 1.0636 low. And even if the selloff continues below that low, they know that there will probably be a reversal up.<p>Since the March low is nearby and a higher low is likely, traders expect a reversal up within the next few weeks. Less likely, there will be a successful break below the March low and a trend down to par.<h2 id=\"covid-19-update\">Covid 19 Update</h2><p>First of all, on February 29, 2020, when there were only 70 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in the US, I wrote that possibly<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/market-analysis/emini-has-30-chance-30-correction-coronavirus-pandemic/#coronavirus-pandemic\" target=\"_blank\">3 billion people could get infected and 50 million people could die.</a>In my chat room that week, I said that it was reasonable to consider the possibility of a million Americans dying and 50% of the country getting infected.<p>If you have been following the news, you might have heard Dr. Fauci a couple weeks ago say that maybe only 60,000 Americans would die. He and Dr. Birx said that the worst case is 100,000 to 200,000 deaths.<p>Who’s right, Dr. Brooks or Dr. Fauci (yes, I really am a physician)? They are political appointees and that constrains them when they speak. They will not lie, but they will also not freely say everything they believe if they want to keep their jobs.<p>I agree that he and Dr. Birx are the experts, but I do not see how we avoid 30 – 50% of the country getting infected. That is 100 to 160 million people.<p>Maybe only 20% will have symptoms, but 1/2 to 1% of the infected people will die. If 1/2% of 160 million infected Americans die, that is about 800,000 people.<p>If only 30% of the country gets infected, a 1/2% death rate results in 500,000 deaths. That is more than the total American deaths in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, The Iraq War, and the Afghan War combined. I do not see how we avoid that. I think 200,000 American deaths is the best case, not the worst case.<h3>A vaccine will not suddenly stop the pandemic</h3><p>My prediction is far worse than the worst case of Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. I hope that Dr. Brooks is wrong and that Drs. Fauci and Birx are right, but I do not see how only 100,000 Americans will die.<p>Even if there is a vaccine in 6 months, the anti-social distancing crowd will guarantee that 30 – 50% of the country gets infected. I think we will be lucky if Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx’s worst case of 200,000 deaths is the final total.<p>It is important to note that I am holding this view even with a vaccine coming early next year. The vaccine is not a light switch that instantly turns the pandemic off. It will roll on for many months after the start of vaccinations. Millions more Americans will still get infected after the vaccinations begin.<h3>The importance of multiple studies confirming each other</h3><p>Last week I wrote that I needed to see other studies confirming the benefit of Remdesivir in the treatment of severe Covid 19 infections. A study came out this week that found no benefit.<p>I mentioned that I was a medical scientist many decades ago and I never believe anything until it has been confirmed by at least 3 or 4 major medical centers. Also, I really need to see a double blind study where neither the patient nor the doctor knows if the patient is receiving the medicine or the placebo.<h3>What’s a double blind study?</h3><p>A double blind study is one where both the patient and the doctor are “blind.” The patient is treated with either a placebo or the medicine, but neither the doctor nor the patient knows which is in the medicine bottle.<p>Here is a simplistic way to look at it. There is a box of pill bottles and each bottle has a different number on it. The doctor randomly grabs a bottle of pills and gives it to the patient. He then plugs the bottle’s number and the patient’s name into a computer.<p>When the date arrives for the end of the study, the doctors decide if each patient is better or not. They enter that into the computer. After the doctors vote on every patient, the computer program allows everyone to see if the patients who got the medicine did better than those who got the placebo. They compare the 2 treatments using every at every imaginable factor. That includes every symptom, sign, side effect, and measure of success.<h3>It’s all about the math</h3><p>A medical statistician applies some formulas to the data to determine how significant the result is. If the math shows that there is a 95% chance or better that the medicine is better than the placebo, the scientists conclude that the medicine is effective and that the result is statistically “significant.”<p>Again, they look at every way to measure what “effective” is. The headline ways are what you hear about. Those are things like the percent who died in each group or how long it took to get better.<p>The treated patients can do much better than the untreated patients, or just a tiny bit better. For example, assume that 1000 patients took the medicine and all were 100% cured the next day. Also assume that only 1% of placebo patients were better on the 2nd day and the average placebo patient got better in 10 days. The drug is clearly effective.<p>But, for a different drug, assume that the average patient got better in 9 days and the average placebo patient took 10 days. There still might be 95% certainty that the medicine was effective, but it was not much better than the placebo. Most doctors would not prescribe the drug because every drug has side effects. Those could erase the 1 day benefit.<p>A well-constructed, big, double blind, multi-medical center test is considered the gold standard of medical testing. It is the best way to eliminate even minor biases, and of course, fraud. There are still ways to mess it up. But if it is done on a lot of patients with many doctors at many medical centers participating in the study, it is very reliable.<p>Also, remember the early studies that showed that anti-malarial drugs were helpful? I always cringe when I see non-scientists hype stuff like that. It is ignorant. It does a disservice because people die from following the stupid recommendations. Well, new studies have shown that they not only did not help, they increase the risk of death.<h3>To paraphrase James Carville, “It’s the vaccine, stupid”</h3><p>All of this stuff about treatment is just entertainment to distract us from what everyone knows is true. There is no return to anything close to normal until there is a safe and effective vaccine.<p>And unless it is perfect, life for us might be different forever, at least to some extent. The more our behavior remains different, the more weight there will be on the economy.<p>Since the vaccines (there will be many options) will not be perfect, many people will curtail some activities forever. If enough reduce their spending, there will be a permanent reduction in the world’s GDP.<h3>American hubris</h3><p>I think the press is missing something. All I hear about is American scientists working on vaccines. There are already many vaccines currently being tested in the US. But the FDA will not allow them to be used on the public until 3 phases of testing are complete. That will be in early 2021.<p>I have met many very smart doctors and medical scientists from around the world and they are just as good as our best. They are also working on vaccines. Many are in countries that do not have exactly the same lengthy 3 phase testing that we have in the US. I bet one or more effective vaccines will be approved overseas within 4 – 6 months.<p>If the pandemic continues to be horrific, the FDA might be forced to allow these vaccines to be used in the US before the regular 3 phase testing is complete. If not, lots of Americans will start flying again… to the countries that will give them the vaccine!<h3>A vaccine has to be both safe and effective</h3><p>I said that the vaccine has to be safe and effective. If the vaccine has a high incidence of serious side effects, most people will not get it. Life will remain as it is now.<p>Also, the vaccine has to be effective. The public has the erroneous opinion that effective vaccines prevent close to 100% of infections. That is nonsense.<p>In a good year, 30% of people receiving a flu shot can still get the flu. When 30% can get infected, that is considered a great flu vaccine. In a bad year, 70% can still get infected after vaccination. If the coronavirus vaccine is only 50% effective and if wears off in 3 months, then we still have a major coronavirus problem.<p>All viruses mutate. There is a reasonable chance that mutations of the current coronavirus (the official name is SARS-CoV-2) could be with us forever. If so, we might end up getting a combined flu and coronavirus vaccine every year.<h3>Christopher Marlowe and the economy</h3><p>If I am right, then the pandemic is going to last much longer and affect far more people than what the news is reporting. Yes, the stock market is rallying and there are many hopeful stories about several states getting back to work. But, is this sustainable? Not if my thoughts about the pandemic are correct.<p>Why are states talking about lifting social distancing restrictions? Is Georgia’s governor saying that the pandemic is just about over so let’s get back to normal? No! He is arguing that it is better to have 1% of all Georgians die than to continue the anxiety and economic damage that the shutdown in causing.<p>In the short-run, it is good for the economy to have everyone back at work. But over the course of the next year, it will result in 100 million Americans getting infected and 500,000 to 1 million dying. That is a Faustian bargain, and it is why the stock market will have a difficult time making a new high this year.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Big bull inside bar after sell climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-High-1-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-25-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart High 1 bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;reversed up strongly in late March. That put a big tail on the bottom of the March candlestick.<p>The reversal has continued through April. April so far is a big bull bar closing near its high. The bulls want April to close above 2939.75. That is the February close. If April closes above that price, the bulls will have totally reversed the March collapse. That would be a sign of strong bulls and increase the chance of sideways to up prices over the next couple months.<p>However, the die is cast. Those 2 huge bear bars in February and March were a major surprise. Because they are so dramatic, there is a 70% chance of a 2nd leg sideways to down at some point this year. There is only a 30% chance that the bull trend will continue straight up to a new high.<h3>High 1 bull flag</h3><p>This month is an inside bar in a 10 year bull trend. It is also a bull bar. April is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for May. If April closes on its high, May will probably trade above the April high. That would trigger the monthly buy signal.<p>But those 2 huge bear bars make the context bad for the bulls. April is probably only a minor buy signal. That means if May triggers the buy by going above the April high, the rally will likely only last a bar (month) or two.<p>The odds are against a new high at least until after a 2nd leg sideways to down. Consequently, although April is a buy signal bar, there are probably more sellers than buyers somewhere above its high and below the February high.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Emini High 1 bull flag in April buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-High-1-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-25-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart High 1 bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied for 5 weeks from a V bottom. Only 20% of V bottoms grow into bull trends. As strong as this rally has been, it is still likely to be a bull leg in a trading range.<p>That means that there will be a bear leg. The rally retraced more than 50% of the 2 month selloff. It is also near the resistance of the 20 week EMA.<p>Also, 5 months without a pullback is getting excessive for a leg in a trading range. Consequently, traders should expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin within a few weeks.<h3>Strong rally, but pullback soon</h3><p>This week was the 5th bar in the micro channel. Traders have been so eager to buy that they have been buying above the low of the prior week. They will be very happy to buy below the low of the prior week when they finally have the opportunity. Therefore, there are probably buyers below this week’s low.<p>This week was an inside bar in a bull trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for next week. Also, there is room to the magnet of the 20 week EMA just above. This makes it slightly more likely than not that next week will go above this week’s high. That would trigger the buy signal.<p>But this week was only a doji bar. That is a weak buy signal bar. Also, the 5 bar bull micro channel is unsustainable and therefore climactic. Finally, the buy signal is coming from just below the resistance of the 20 week EMA. Therefore, traders should expect more sellers than buyers above this week’s high. Those sellers will be at and just above the 20 week EMA.<p>If next week goes above this week’s high, which is likely, the breakout will probably only last a week or two. Traders should then expect a 2 – 3 week reversal down. A reasonable target would be about a 50% correction. That is around 2500 – 2600.<p>The rally has been strong enough to expect at least a small 2nd leg up. Therefore the bulls will probably buy again below 2600.<h3>V bottom but probably just a leg in a trading range</h3><p>It is important to remember that a rally from a V bottom only has a 20% chance of growing into a bull trend. Therefore, there should be a test down soon. But the rally has been strong enough to make a 2nd leg up likely.<p>These repeated legs up and down are the early signs of a trading range. This developing range will probably be between 2500 and 3000. It is within the 2 1/2 year trading range between 2200 and 3400.<p>The January 2018 rally was the most extreme buy climax in history on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. Traders should expect this 2 1/2 year trading range to continue for the decade. There will probably be at least one new high and low. Traders should expect the 10 year range to expand and be between 1800 and 3600.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Weak wedge top so might get one more leg up</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-High-1-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-25-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart High 1 bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a bull inside bar in a 5 week bull trend on Friday. That is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. Remember, on the weekly chart, last week was also an inside bar and a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>There are already 3 legs up in the 5 week rally on the daily chart. That means there is a wedge, which is a type of buy climax. Buy climaxes tend to attract profit takers and bears willing to short. But if there is one more leg up and then a reversal, the wedge would be more convincing. That would attract more sellers.<p>The wedge top on the daily chart has a bad shape. As a result, many bears are hesitant to sell and many bulls are continuing to buy. They think the rally will continue at least a little higher.<p>In addition to the bad shape of the wedge on the daily chart, the weekly chart has a buy signal bar this week. Also, the 20 week EMA is a magnet just above. These factors make it slightly more likely that there will be one more leg up on the daily chart before a 2 – 3 week selloff to below 2600 begins.<h3>V bottom but probable leg in a trading range</h3><p>As I discussed in the section on the weekly chart, the Emini is reversing up in a V bottom. Only 20% of V bottoms grow into bull trends. Traders know that the rally is likely to end soon. But until there is a clear top at resistance, the bulls will continue to buy.<p>This reversal has gone a long way and lasted a long time. Since traders believe it is not the start of a trend, they expect a bear leg to begin soon. There is almost a 50% chance that it is already underway.<p>Because the rally has been so strong, there will be many bulls who will be eager to buy the 1st pullback. Consequently, it will probably only last 2 – 3 weeks. It might retrace about half of the rally.<p>The rally is a Spike and Channel Bull Trend. Traders expect the eventual reversal to test the start of the channel. That is the April 1 higher low. But that is far below and the rally has been extremely strong. The 1st reversal down will probably not fall that far.<p>What are alternative targets? A common one is a test of the breakout point. That is the March 31 high of 2629.50. Another is a 50% correction. There is also the gap above the early April 3 day island bottom. These are all in the 2500 – 2600 area and that makes a pullback to that level likely.<h3>What happens next week?</h3><p>If the selloff to below 2600 has already begun, the bears should be able to create at least a couple big bear bars. It is more likely that the weekly chart will control the Emini over the next 2 weeks. Traders should expect one more push up to the weekly EMA next week. Since the weekly buy signal bar is weak and the rally is extreme, traders should then look for a 2 – 3 week correction to below 2600 to begin a week or two later.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Last week was an inside bar on the weekly chart. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for this week.<p>Friday was an inside bar on the daily chart. It is also a High 1 buy signal bar.<p>The 20 week EMA is at 2911 and it is a magnet just above last week’s high. Traders should expect a move above the weekly EMA today or this week.<p>However, there is a wedge rally on the daily chart. Also, there is now a 6 week bull micro channel on the weekly chart. That is extreme and unsustainable. Consequently, traders should expect this week to rally early and then reverse down at the end of the week or early next week.<p>Can today be a big bear day? Thursday was a sell signal bar on the daily chart. While it is possible, The Emini is more likely to be sideways to up today. It should rally to at least a little above the 20 week EMA this week before sellers will consider becoming aggressive.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 28 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above Friday’s high and trigger the daily buy signal.<p>It is just a few points below last week’s high. If it gaps above it or trades above it, the Emini will also trigger the weekly buy signal.<p>With the daily and weekly charts having buy signals in bull trends and magnets above, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day today. Can we see the opposite? Of course, especially since the 5 minute chart was in a buy climax on Friday. But the odds favor a move above resistance at some point this week. This is true even if there is a bear day 1st.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trading-range-open-and-then-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-27.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range open and then small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-higher-low-major-trend-reversal-and-High-2-bull-flag-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-27-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart today triggered a higher low major trend reversal buy signal by going above Friday’s high. The month-long selloff had 2 legs down from the March 27 strong rally. It is therefore also a High 2 bull flag buy signal.<p>Friday was a strong buy signal bar. Traders expect 2 – 4 weeks of sideways to up trading. However, if the rally turns down from resistance, there could be another brief leg down to below last week’s low. If so the month-long bear channel would then probably evolve into a wedge bottom instead of a High 2 bottom.<p>The chart has been in a trading range for 8 months. Consequently, traders keep looking for legs up and down to reverse every few weeks. This is a good candidate for the start of a leg up. But they also expect disappointment.<p>There is nearby resistance. This includes the month-long bear trend line, the daily and weekly EMAs, and last week’s high. However, the bears need a strong break below the March low before traders will conclude that a leg up is not imminent.<p>If the bulls get a series of strong bull days, the rally will probably quickly test the March 27 high. But look at the past month. The bars are small and have prominent tails. They mostly overlap one another. This is trading range price action. Therefore, the rally will probably not race higher.<p>Traders will be hesitant until they see clear strength. They expect a pause for several days this week for a possible attempt at a double top bear flag at resistance. That will make the bulls quick to take profits.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied for 2 days in a Spike and Channel bull trend. That typically is followed by a break below the bull channel and then a transition into a trading range.<p>While today triggered a buy signal on the daily chart, the EURUSD has traded sideways in a a 30 pip range overnight. Day traders have been scalping reversals up or down for 10 – 20 pips.<p>This is because they see that the daily chart is near resistance and the past month has had mostly trading range price action. They expect the 2 day rally to stall here or around last week’s high.<p>Day traders are willing to swing trade, but they need to see a series of strong trend bars breaking far above or below the overnight range. That is unlikely. Today will probably remain a trading range day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-after-gap-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open after gap up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After trend resumption up, there was a small selloff into the close. By going above last week’s high, it triggered the weekly buy signal.<p>Traders should expect the Emini to reach the 20 week EMA at some point this week. It is currently at 2901, which is less than 20 points below today’s high.<p>However, the Emini will probably then begin a 2 – 3 week reversal down. The Emini should remain in a trading range all year.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Last week was an inside bar on the weekly chart. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for this week.<p>Friday was an inside bar on the daily chart. It is also a High 1 buy signal bar.<p>The 20 week EMA is at 2911 and it is a magnet just above last week’s high. Traders should expect a move above the weekly EMA today or this week.<p>However, there is a wedge rally on the daily chart. Also, there is now a 6 week bull micro channel on the weekly chart. That is extreme and unsustainable. Consequently, traders should expect this week to rally early and then reverse down at the end of the week or early next week.<p>Can today be a big bear day? Thursday was a sell signal bar on the daily chart. While it is possible, The Emini is more likely to be sideways to up today. It should rally to at least a little above the 20 week EMA this week before sellers will consider becoming aggressive.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 28 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above Friday’s high and trigger the daily buy signal.<p>It is just a few points below last week’s high. If it gaps above it or trades above it, the Emini will also trigger the weekly buy signal.<p>With the daily and weekly charts having buy signals in bull trends and magnets above, there is an increased chance of a bull trend day today. Can we see the opposite? Of course, especially since the 5 minute chart was in a buy climax on Friday. But the odds favor a move above resistance at some point this week. This is true even if there is a bear day 1st.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-trading-range-open-and-then-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-27.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range open and then small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EURUSD-Forex-higher-low-major-trend-reversal-and-High-2-bull-flag-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-27-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart today triggered a higher low major trend reversal buy signal by going above Friday’s high. The month-long selloff had 2 legs down from the March 27 strong rally. It is therefore also a High 2 bull flag buy signal.<p>Friday was a strong buy signal bar. Traders expect 2 – 4 weeks of sideways to up trading. However, if the rally turns down from resistance, there could be another brief leg down to below last week’s low. If so the month-long bear channel would then probably evolve into a wedge bottom instead of a High 2 bottom.<p>The chart has been in a trading range for 8 months. Consequently, traders keep looking for legs up and down to reverse every few weeks. This is a good candidate for the start of a leg up. But they also expect disappointment.<p>There is nearby resistance. This includes the month-long bear trend line, the daily and weekly EMAs, and last week’s high. However, the bears need a strong break below the March low before traders will conclude that a leg up is not imminent.<p>If the bulls get a series of strong bull days, the rally will probably quickly test the March 27 high. But look at the past month. The bars are small and have prominent tails. They mostly overlap one another. This is trading range price action. Therefore, the rally will probably not race higher.<p>Traders will be hesitant until they see clear strength. They expect a pause for several days this week for a possible attempt at a double top bear flag at resistance. That will make the bulls quick to take profits.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied for 2 days in a Spike and Channel bull trend. That typically is followed by a break below the bull channel and then a transition into a trading range.<p>While today triggered a buy signal on the daily chart, the EURUSD has traded sideways in a a 30 pip range overnight. Day traders have been scalping reversals up or down for 10 – 20 pips.<p>This is because they see that the daily chart is near resistance and the past month has had mostly trading range price action. They expect the 2 day rally to stall here or around last week’s high.<p>Day traders are willing to swing trade, but they need to see a series of strong trend bars breaking far above or below the overnight range. That is unlikely. Today will probably remain a trading range day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-after-gap-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open after gap up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After trend resumption up, there was a small selloff into the close. By going above last week’s high, it triggered the weekly buy signal.<p>Traders should expect the Emini to reach the 20 week EMA at some point this week. It is currently at 2901, which is less than 20 points below today’s high.<p>However, the Emini will probably then begin a 2 – 3 week reversal down. The Emini should remain in a trading range all year.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The most important factor currently is the 20 week EMA. There is a 6 week bull micro channel on the weekly chart. That is a strong bull trend. Yesterday, the Emini was just below the EMA, which is a strong magnet. Traders should expect the Emini to get above the 20 week EMA today after the strong rally in the Globex session. The average is currently at 2901.<p>The entire 6 week rally is probably a bull leg in a 2 1/2 year trading range. Therefore, a bear leg should begin within a couple weeks. However, traders do not expect it to start until the Emini goes at least a little above the 20 week EMA.<p>Once the bears get their 2 – 3 week selloff, the bulls will buy it. When a 6 week rally is as strong as this one has been, there is a 70% chance that the bulls will buy the 1st reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 40 points in the Globex session. It is currently just above the day session’s 20 week EMA.<p>I have been saying that it would probably get above that price this week. I also said that it could get all the way up to the March 3 lower high before pulling back for a few weeks.<p>However, it is more likely that it will begin to pull back within a couple weeks. A reversal down from here would be from a clearer wedge top. Traders would have more confidence selling if they get a strong sell signal bar.<h3>3 days in a tight bull channel is extreme</h3><p>The Emini has rallied in a tight bull channel on the 5 minute chart for 2 days. Today would be the 3rd day. That typically is the outer limit for the duration of a buy climax. Therefore, there is an increased chance of either a trading range or at least a minor reversal coming today or tomorrow.<p>The overnight bull trend has been in a tight bull channel. There is no sign of a top. But there will probably be a big gap up. If so, the Emini will be far above its 20 bar EMA on the 5 minute chart. Since the bulls do not want to pay too much above the average price and the chart is overbought, there is an increased chance of an early trading range.<h3>Targets for the bulls</h3><p>The bulls do not need to do more than they have already done overnight. They will probably break above the 20 week EMA on the open. If they can close today above that EMA, they will increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p>They would like the Emini to close far above the EMA. Their next target is 2939.75. That is the February close. If the bulls can get there, they will have completely erased the March pandemic crash.<p>Traders would then wonder if the rally will continue up to the March 3 lower high. That was the start of the March parabolic bear channel.<h3>Strong bull trend so not great downside risk</h3><p>The bears know that there are now 3 clear legs up on the daily chart. Also, the rally is at important resistance. They want the break above the 20 week EMA to fail.<p>But a strong bull trend does not typically become a bear trend without first transitioning into a trading range for a few days Consequently, the downside risk over the next few days is not great. But, the odds favor a 50% correction of the April rally to begin within a few weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-after-gap-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-28.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open after gap up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There was a good buy signal bar 2 days ago.<p>While the entry bar yesterday was only a doji bar, today is an outside up day. The EURUSD traded below yesterday’s low, which triggered a Low 1 sell signal. But it immediately reversed up to above yesterday’s high. This is a sign that the bulls are stronger than the bears.<p>The EURUSD is probably beginning a 2 – 4 week rally. It is important to remember that the chart has been sideways for 8 months. Every strong leg up and down reversed in about 2 – 4 weeks. Consequently, even though this is a major buy signal, the result will probably be minor. That means another leg in the 8 month trading range instead of the start of a bull trend.<h3>Weekly chart has weak High 2 bull flag</h3><p>The EURUSD daily chart has been in a smaller trading range for a month within its 8 month range. It might stall at last week’s high.<p>On the weekly chart, last week is a High 2 buy signal bar. But it is a bear bar in a 7 week tight trading range.<p>That is a weak buy setup. It increases the chance of more sideways trading. Therefore, the EURUSD might remain stuck below 1.10 for a few weeks before breaking out to test either the March high above or the March low below.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied strongly from below yesterday’s low to above yesterday’s high. The bulls accomplished their goal of creating an outside up day. That increases the chance of higher prices for a week or two.<p>Their minimum goal for the remainder of the day is to have today close above yesterday’s high. They would like today to close above last week’s high. That would trigger the weekly buy signal. But it is more significant to have a strong outside up candlestick on the daily chart.<p>It is important to note that the bulls have not bought aggressively above yesterday’s high so far. The 5 minute chart has been in a tight trading range for 4 hours. Since the bears have not yet had a 20 – 30 pip pullback, most traders are only looking to buy. But if the bulls continue to fail to resume the rally, the bears will begin to sell for scalps.<p>While it is possible for today to reverse back down to below yesterday’s low, there is only a 20% chance. Traders expect today to pay a lot of attention to yesterday’s high. Today might pull back from above yesterday’s high and close in the middle of the range. More likely it will close around yesterday’s high.<p>Since a trading range in a bull trend is a bull flag, the bulls have a 60% chance of at least a small additional leg up after the early overnight rally. That could then trigger the weekly buy signal.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-Low-2-top-then-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 top then parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then entered a trading range for several hours. The selling resumed into the close and the day closed near the low.<p>There are now 3 clear legs up on the daily chart. This is a wedge rally, which is a type of buy climax. That typically attracts profit taking. Consequently, a 2 – 3 week pullback should begin by the end of next week.<p>Today is a sell signal bar for tomorrow. But when a rally is strong like it has been on the daily chart, the Emini often has to go sideways for a few days before it goes down. Therefore, there might not be a lot of sellers below today’s low. The bears might wait for tomorrow’s FOMC announcement or for next week after they see how this week closes.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That could then trigger the weekly buy signal.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-Low-2-top-then-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 top then parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars.

It then entered a trading range for several hours. The selling resumed into the close and the day closed near the low.<p>There are now 3 clear legs up on the daily chart. This is a wedge rally, which is a type of buy climax. That typically attracts profit taking. Consequently, a 2 – 3 week pullback should begin by the end of next week.<p>Today is a sell signal bar for tomorrow. But when a rally is strong like it has been on the daily chart, the Emini often has to go sideways for a few days before it goes down. Therefore, there might not be a lot of sellers below today’s low. The bears might wait for tomorrow’s FOMC announcement or for next week after they see how this week closes.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That often leads to a big move up or down. However, there will probably not be any surprises from the meeting.<p>There are now 3 clear legs up on the daily chart. This is a wedge rally. A wedge is a buy climax. It typically attracts profit-takers. Traders should expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin either this week or next week.<p>Yesterday had a bear body and is therefore a sell signal bar. But after a strong 5 week rally, the Emini might have to go sideways to up for a few days before going down. Traders expect it to begin to pull back soon.<h3>The importance of the 20 week EMA</h3><p>I have been saying that the Emini would probably have to reach the 20 week EMA before pulling back. It got there yesterday on the open and sold off. The Emini might test it 2 or 3 days before traders decide that the resistance will hold or that the rally will continue to the March 3 lower high.<p>Last week was only a doji bar on the weekly chart. That is a weak buy signal bar. A weak buy signal bar often has more sellers than buyers above its high.<p>This week triggered the buy signal by going above last week’s high. But there is now a 6 bar bull micro channel, which is extreme. It is at the resistance of the 20 week EMA and it is coming after a huge selloff.<p>A weak buy setup at resistance typically does not lead to a strong leg up. More often, there is a pullback that starts within a couple bars. Therefore, the Emini will probably begin to pullback soon for 2 – 3 weeks.<p>The selloff might retrace about half of the rally. Since the rally has been surprisingly strong, traders will look to buy the selloff. They expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up to test the March 3 lower high.<p>The Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years. It will probably remain in the range for the rest of this year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 45 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open with a big gap above yesterday’s close. A big gap usually leads to a trading range for the 1st hour. The bulls will look to buy a wedge bottom or double bottom near the EMA. However, the bears want a reversal down from a wedge top or double top. There is only a 20% chance of a strong trend day from the open up or down.<p>The 20 week EMA is at 2901 and it is significant resistance. However, the bull trend is strong and it could easily continue up to the next resistance within the next couple weeks. That is the March 3 lower high of 3125.75.<p>Most days over the past month have had a lot of trading range price action. Day traders will expect that again today. But, there have also been at least 1 or 2 swings up or down every day as well, Because the weekly chart is at important resistance, there is a slightly greater chance of a trend today.<p>However, day traders should go flat before the 11 a.m. PST FOMC announcement. This is because there is a 60% chance of at least one big reversal coming within the 1st few minutes. It is better to wait at least 10 minutes after the report before resuming day trading. Furthermore, day traders should be open to anything. That means a strong trend up or down, a big reversal, or a trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-Low-2-top-then-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-29.png\" alt=\"Emini Low 2 top then parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, it has gone sideways rather than up. Because the EURUSD is in an 8 month trading range, traders expecting disappoint.<p>The bears want yesterday’s high to be a sell signal for a double top with last week’s high. But because this is in a trading range, there will more likely be buyers below the April 24 low. That is the neck line of the double top. If there is a reversal up from below that low, the month-long selloff will evolve into a wedge bottom.<p>The bears want a strong break below the March low and then a move down to par (1.0). While they might achieve their goal at some point, 80% of breakout attempts fail. Traders will continue to look for reversals every few weeks. Since the EURUSD has sold off for about a month after the March 27 rally, traders expect a leg up soon.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to just below yesterday’s high and reversed down to just above yesterday’s low. Today is so far an inside day.<p>Since yesterday was an outside day, if today remains inside, there will be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) setup. That is a Breakout Mode Pattern on the daily chart. However, the daily chart has been in Breakout Mode for several weeks. Therefore, an ioi does not change anything.<p>Today’s range has been small and today is the 3rd consecutive small, sideways day. Day traders have been scalping.<p>The range will probably stay small until the 11 a.m. PST FOMC announcement. While no one expects any surprises, all financial markets often make big moves after the report. Day traders should exit positions ahead of the report and wait at least 10 minutes afterwards before taking new day trades. This is because there is a 60% chance of at least one fast reversal within the 1st several minutes after the announcement.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-FOMC-trading-range-after-test-February-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC trading range after test February close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The 7 week bull micro channel is extreme and it is coming after a big bear trend. There is now a wedge rally on the 60 minute chart nested within the wedge rally on the daily chart. But, there is no reversal yet.<p>Traders should expect the rally to be just another leg in the 2 1/2 year trading range. That means there should soon be a bear leg. The context is good for the bear leg to begin within the next few weeks.<p>I said over the weekend that this week might rally and then reverse. That would create a doji bar on the weekly chart. A doji bar is common after a High 1 where the buy signal bar was also a doji. This increases the chance of a reversal down this week or next. However, there is no sign of a reversal at the moment. Furthermore, the open of the week is probably too far below for a selloff today to get there.<p>The bull channel has been tight. This is a strong bull trend. It will probably reach the March 3 lower high at some point this year. Traders currently think that there will be a pullback before the bulls get their target.<h3>April erased the March crash</h3><p>Today is the last day of April. April is currently a big bull bar on the monthly chart. Yesterday got back to the February close. April therefore totally erased March’s collapse.<p>The bulls would like the month to close on its high. It would then be a good buy signal bar for May. It would increase the chance of higher prices in May. That February close could be a magnet today, especially in the final hour.<p>However, April follows 2 big bear bars on the monthly chart. Therefore, there will probably be sellers above the April high and below the all-time high of February. The 2 1/2 year trading range will probably continue for the rest of the year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 13 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was sideways for 4 hours and today will open within that range. That increases the chance of more trading range price action today.<p>The most important price for today is the February close. It could be a magnet all day. If the Emini is within 20 points of it in the last hour, it might get drawn to it.<p>The Emini on the monthly chart currently has a big bull bar closing on its high. Most bars on the monthly chart have at least noticeable tails on top and bottom. That increases the chance that today will close at least 20 points below the high of the month.<p>The high currently is yesterday’s high. Today could make a new high. But even if it does, there is an increased chance of a late selloff and the month closing 20 or more points below the high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-FOMC-trading-range-after-test-February-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-30.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC trading range after test February close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

A brief bear breakout led to a lower trading range. Today was a Bear Trending Trading Range Day.<p>Today was also the end of the month. April was a big bull inside bar in a 12 year bull trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for May.<p>May might have to get above the April high to see what’s there. That would trigger the buy signal, but it comes after 2 huge bear bars on the monthly chart. There probably will be more sellers than buyers above its high. Traders expect the 2 1/2 year trading range to continue all year.<p>There is a nested wedge on the 60 minute and daily charts. However, about half of wedges in strong trends have at least a small new high before there is a reversal down.<p>A new high above the daily wedge would trigger the monthly buy signal. But, traders expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin within a couple weeks. As strong as the rally has been, there is probably not much left to it.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The 7 week bull micro channel is extreme and it is coming after a big bear trend. There is now a wedge rally on the 60 minute chart nested within the wedge rally on the daily chart. But, there is no reversal yet.<p>Traders should expect the rally to be just another leg in the 2 1/2 year trading range. That means there should soon be a bear leg. The context is good for the bear leg to begin within the next few weeks.<p>I said over the weekend that this week might rally and then reverse. That would create a doji bar on the weekly chart. A doji bar is common after a High 1 where the buy signal bar was also a doji. This increases the chance of a reversal down this week or next. However, there is no sign of a reversal at the moment. Furthermore, the open of the week is probably too far below for a selloff today to get there.<p>The bull channel has been tight. This is a strong bull trend. It will probably reach the March 3 lower high at some point this year. Traders currently think that there will be a pullback before the bulls get their target.<h3>April erased the March crash</h3><p>Today is the last day of April. April is currently a big bull bar on the monthly chart. Yesterday got back to the February close. April therefore totally erased March’s collapse.<p>The bulls would like the month to close on its high. It would then be a good buy signal bar for May. It would increase the chance of higher prices in May. That February close could be a magnet today, especially in the final hour.<p>However, April follows 2 big bear bars on the monthly chart. Therefore, there will probably be sellers above the April high and below the all-time high of February. The 2 1/2 year trading range will probably continue for the rest of the year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 13 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was sideways for 4 hours and today will open within that range. That increases the chance of more trading range price action today.<p>The most important price for today is the February close. It could be a magnet all day. If the Emini is within 20 points of it in the last hour, it might get drawn to it.<p>The Emini on the monthly chart currently has a big bull bar closing on its high. Most bars on the monthly chart have at least noticeable tails on top and bottom. That increases the chance that today will close at least 20 points below the high of the month.<p>The high currently is yesterday’s high. Today could make a new high. But even if it does, there is an increased chance of a late selloff and the month closing 20 or more points below the high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-FOMC-trading-range-after-test-February-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-4-30.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC trading range after test February close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.
