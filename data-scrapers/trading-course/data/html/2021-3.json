It closed below the middle of the month, which is slightly bearish because of the parabolic wedge on the monthly chart – a bear follow-through day. On the weekly chart, it was the 2nd consecutive bear bar, which increases the chance of lower prices this week.<p>Most importantly, the daily chart on Friday did something that it has not done since October. Friday was the day after a big bear day, and it had a bear body. Every other big bear day for 4 months was followed by a bull day, and soon by a new all-time high.<p>The bear body confirmed Thursday’s big selloff. A confirmed selloff has better than a 50% chance of at least slightly lower prices. That increases the chance that a 10% correction is underway. However, the Emini could go sideways for several days before it continues down.<p>With it up 40 points in the Globex session, today will open around Friday’s open, and Friday was a big bear day. This is important. When there is a big bear day and the next day opens at the open and high of the bear day, there is an increased chance of a big bull trend day. When that happens, they often begin strong bull trends. Look at March 24, 2020 on the daily chart.<p>A big bull day today could make the daily chart neutral once again, but without that, traders should expect lower prices over the next couple weeks. The bulls need consecutive bull days to flip the odds back in favor of a new high before there is a 10% pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 40 points in the Globex session. It will probably open around the 3,850 Big Round Number and Friday’s close. While the bulls are hoping that today will be a big bull day, and a resumption of the yearlong bull trend, they will probably need a series of strong bull bars in the 1st hour. If they get it, day traders will have a better chance of a bull trend day. But if there is a trading range open, day traders will assume that the bulls will fail. Today will probably then be mostly sideways.<p>Can today be a big bear day? Probably not with it opening near Friday’s high. If the bears were strong, they would have had today open near Friday’s low.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Emini-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-1.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and bull trend reversal and bear follow-through day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

A trading range constantly forms new buy and sell setups, but most fail. Until there are consecutive closes above or below the range, traders will continue to bet on reversals.<p>The bulls formed a head and shoulders bottom last week. After breaking above the neckline, the EURUSD reversed down and is testing the bottom of the right shoulder. The bulls now want a double bottom for the right shoulder.<p>The bears see last week’s reversal as a lower high major trend reversal, and a failed breakout below the neckline of the head and shoulders bottom. They want today to fall at least a couple pips below the February 17 right shoulder. That would increase the chance of a test of the February 5 bottom of the trading range.<p>It is important that last week was a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. Today triggered the weekly sell signal by going below last week’s low. While the EURUSD has been sideways for 2 months, there is a clear wedge top. The odds slightly favor a bear breakout, and a test of the November low of 1.16 over the next couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off sharply overnight, but it stopped 1 pip above the February 17 low. It has been sideways in a 20-pip range for the past 2 hours. The bears are hoping that this is a bear flag, and want trend resumption down. If today falls far below that low, especially if today closes on its low and far below that low, traders will look for a break below the February 5 low.<p>Because the biggest bounce has only been 20 pips, day traders cannot make money yet buying with stops. The should wait for a reversal up from the bottom of the range, or for a strong break above the range.<p>However, with the range being so tight for 3 hours, bear day traders are not making money either.<p>When a range is tight like this, it is difficult to make 10 pips with stop entries. Most traders should wait for a small bear reversal bar near the top, to sell or for a small bull reversal up from the bottom to buy. Or, wait for a clear breakout in either direction.<p>Because the EURUSD is at a critical price, and in a trading range on the daily chart, there normally would be an increased chance of a reversal up. But with the earlier selloff as strong as it was, the bulls will have a difficult time getting a big reversal today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-1-2.png\" alt=\"\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls hope last week was a bear trap, but they need another bull day tomorrow to confirm the reversal up. The bears will try to get a double top with last week’s high.<p>Today made the Emini neutral again. Traders need more information. A strong bull day tomorrow will make traders expect a test of 4,000 this month. But a strong bear day tomorrow will make traders see today as just a pullback from last week’s 2 big bear days.<p>The Emini has been in a trading range for a month. Traders are looking for reversals every few days. Today tested the 3900 Big Round Number again, like the majority of days since early February. In fact, today pulled back into the close to finish just 2 ticks below that 3,900 magnet.<p>What should traders expect tomorrow? Because the Emini is in a trading range on the daily chart, traders expect disappointing follow-through up and down. Also, the day after a big buy climax day like today has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading starting by the end of the 2nd hour.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That has not happened since the 10% corrections in September and October. It made a 10% correction likely.<p>However, yesterday was a big bull day, and the Emini is now back to neutral. If the bulls get a strong follow-through day today, traders will expect a break above 4,000 in March. But if today is a big bear day, traders will see yesterday as a pullback from last week’s bear days. They would then again think that a 10% correction is underway.<p>Which is more likely? Neither. The Emini has been in a trading range oscillating around 3,900 for a month. That means lots of reversals, which increases the chance of disappointing follow-through for the bulls today.<p>Also, yesterday was a buy climax day on the 5-minute chart. The day after a buy climax has a 75% chance of a couple hours of sideways to down trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 6 points in the Globex session. That increases the chance that it will continue yesterday’s trading range, which began after the early rally.<p>Since 3,900 has been such an important magnet for a month and the Emini is very close, the Emini will probably test it again today. But with the daily chart in a trading range for a month, today will probably not be a 2nd consecutive big bull day.<p>Since yesterday was a Bull Surprise, there should be a least a little more sideways to up trading today or tomorrow. That makes a big bear day unlikely. Therefore, today will probably be either a trading range day or a weak trend day in either direction. Also, with today opening within yesterday’s trading range, there is an increased chance of a trading range open.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-consecutive-wedge-tops.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and consecutive wedge tops\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-testing-January-1st-bottom-of-3-month-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-2-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex testing January 1st bottom of 3 month trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is again testing the January 1 sell climax low. With the overnight reversal up from below support, the odds are against a close far below the January 1 low today.<p>The bears got a big bear bar in early February that closed below the January 5 low, but they need consecutive closes below support to convince traders that the bear breakout will succeed. They are trying to get another close below today, but they now need closes below the new low of the trading range, which is the February 5 low.<p>After 4 strong days down, the bulls will probably need a micro double bottom before they can get a leg up. With the EURUSD looking like it will not close below the January low and with the bulls needing a micro double bottom, there is an increased chance that today will be sideways.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off again below the January 1 low and again reversed up. It did not fall below the February 5 low, which is the new low of the 3-month trading range.<p>The overnight reversal up so far has only been 40 pips, and the EURUSD has been sideways for 3 hours. The minimum goal for the bulls is to have today close above or around the February 17 low. If the EURUSD simply continues sideways here, they will have achieved their goal. That would increase the chance that it will reverse up again from the bottom of the range.<p>Can today collapse down to the February 5 low or rally strongly today? Probably not. The range and the legs have been small. Day traders have only been scalping. With the EURUSD oversold, if there is going to be a big trend today, up is more likely. However, a continuation of the trading range day is most likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-trading-range-day-with-close-near-low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with close near low\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It tried a couple more times to get above 3,900 and failed. It again sold off to the 60 minute EMA at the end of the day, but could not break far below below.<p>The Emini closed near the low of the day, and there was no follow-through buying after yesterday’s reversal up. That shifts the odds a little in favor of the bears.<p>The Emini has been stuck at 3,900 for a month, and it has been reversing every few days. Traders are deciding if the bull trend will resume to above 4,000 or correct down 10%.<p>With today being an inside day closing on its low, it is a sell signal bar for tomorrow on the daily chart. If the bears create another big bear day again tomorrow, the odds of a 10% correction in March will be back at 60%.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is a sell signal bar for today. If the Emini forms a 2nd consecutive big bear day today, the probability of a 10% correction will be back to 60%, as it was on Friday’s close. But if today is a strong bull day, the Emini will be back to neutral and possibly bullish despite the Emini oscillating around 3900.<p>The Emini yesterday again failed at 3,900, as it has many times for the past month. As a general rule, if the market tries several times to do something and fails, it then often tries to do the opposite. Traders should know within a week if the Emini will rally to 4,000 or correct down 10% in March. After yesterday, the odds are back to slightly favoring the bears. But one big bull day closing above last week’s high, would flip them back again in favor of the bulls.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down over 10 points in the Globex session. It is below yesterday’s low, and yesterday was a sell signal bar on the daily chart. Today will probably trade below yesterday’s low, which would trigger the sell signal. But since the Emini is in the middle of the 6-day trading range, there might be more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low. The 6-day trading range is neutral, which increases the chance of another sideways day. The recent ranges have been big, so if today is a trading range day, there should be at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>Everyone knows that the daily chart is in Breakout Mode. Traders are ready for several consecutive strong trend days in either direction. If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the 1st hour, the chance of a bull trend day will go up. But if there is a trading range open, traders know that today will probably be another trading range day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-trading-range-day-with-close-near-low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-3.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with close near low and Emini oscillating around 3900.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-testing-bottom-of-3-month-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-3-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been in a trading range for 3 months. Every attempt to break out reversed, which is what happens in a trading range. The EURUSD is now at the bottom of the range. Traders hope that the 4-day selloff will lead to a successful breakout. They see yesterday as a pullback from the break below the January 1 low.<p>However, the bulls see yesterday as a failed breakout, and they are hoping for a reversal up to the middle or top of the range, over the next couple weeks. For them, the overnight selling is just a pullback from a 2-day rally.<p>Who is right? Both are. But until there are consecutive closes above or below the 3-month range, traders know that reversals and a continuation of the range is likely.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied above yesterday’s high, which triggered a buy signal on the daily chart. But there were more sellers than buyers above yesterday’s high. The EURUSD sold off sharply from a double top overnight. The selloff has been strong enough so that the EURUSD will probably not make a new high today.<p>As strong as the selloff has been, it is now at a 50% retracement of the 2-day rally. Also, the EURUSD is back in Friday’s trading range. That reduces the chance of the selloff continuing much lower.<p>Because the selloff was a strong reversal down, day traders have only been selling since the reversal down began several hours ago. But because it is a sell climax down to support, the bears will probably take profits and the bulls will start to look to buy reversals up for scalps.<p>Day traders will sell rallies all day. Once there is a 20-pip rally, day traders will begin to buy reversals up from the low. This is because they know that this selloff will probably evolve into a trading range within the next couple hours.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/‌Emini-trianlge-with-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-3-2.png\" alt=\"‌Emini triangle with bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a triangle for the 1st half of the day and then a selloff into the close. Because there are again consecutive bear bars with good-size bodies on the daily chart, the probability that this is leading to a 10% correction is back to 60%. The bulls need consecutive strong bull bars to flip the probability back in their favor.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

With 2 more consecutive bear bars with good-size bodies on the daily chart, the odds are back to 60% that a March 10 percent correction is underway. The bulls need consecutive strong bull days to flip the odds back in their favor.<p>Because the Emini is still in a trading range, it could continue sideways for another week or two. But look at the 10% reversals in September and October. They stalled only for a week or so before falling 10%. Traders should expect lower prices, even if the Emini goes sideways this week. A big bear day today will convince traders that the Emini will go down to at least the November 9 high at around 3,650. But with the Emini at the bottom of a 7-day trading range, and yesterday’s selling being climactic, there is an increased chance that today will be sideways to up.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 2 points in the Globex session. If today gaps down, the gap should be small. A small gap typically closes within the 1st hour.<p>Yesterday’s selloff lasted more than 50 bars, which is extreme. It will probably attract some profit taking this morning. That should result in at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading, that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>What happens if today gaps down 10 points, and sells off from the open? Traders would expect a bear trend day and lower prices tomorrow. With the Emini at the bottom of a 7-day tight trading range, and having consecutive big bear days, today will probably not be a 3rd big bear day.<p>Can today reverse up strongly, like it has done twice in the past 7 days? Yes, but it probably will not. Traders are likely becoming resigned to the Emini selling off for a month or two, and the bulls being less eager.<p>So if today probably will not be a big bear day or a big bull day, what will happen? Confusion and exhaustion usually results in a neutral day. There will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down, and a lot of sideways trading.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/‌Emini-trianlge-with-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-4.png\" alt=\"‌Emini triangle with bear breakout., with March 10 percent correction likely.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-4-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is at the bottom of a 3-month trading range. All trading ranges always have a buy and sell setup, but most fail. Trading ranges are more likely to reverse than break out.<p>The bears see yesterday as a pullback from the break below the February 17 low. It was a Low 1 sell signal bar, and today triggered the sell signal, when it traded below yesterday’s low.<p>The bulls are hoping that yesterday, and today, are forming a pullback from the reversal up 2 days ago. They want today or tomorrow to reverse back up, which would create a micro double bottom with Tuesday’s low.<p>What is most likely? More sideways. Even if the EURUSD falls below the February 5 low, it is still more likely to reverse than continue down. Until there are consecutive closes above or below the range, traders will continue to bet on reversals.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been selling off in a broad bear channel since yesterday’s high. That is a weak bear trend, and there have been 3 trading ranges so far. It is always easier to make money selling in a bear trend, but when there are 20-pip bounces, like in this one, bull scalpers will buy reversals up from new lows.<p>The EURUSD is again testing the January 1 low. The bulls want today to close at least 20 pips above that low, to increase the chance of a reversal up tomorrow. If the bulls can get it to close near the high, today would be a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>But if the bears can get today to close on its low, tomorrow will probably trade at least a little lower.<p>So far, today has had many small reversals. There is not a sense that the price is terribly wrong, and that the market has to quickly move to a better price. Unless there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, which is unlikely, today should continue as a scalping day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-sell-climax-and-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then reversed down from a wedge rally to a higher high double top.<p>The selloff was extremely strong. It closed the gap below the February 2 low and fell below last year’s close. The selloff should drop below the November 9 high at a minimum within a couple weeks.<p>Because the Emini is so oversold on the daily chart, it could bounce for a few days along the way. However, traders should sell rallies. The Emini will probably be sideways to down for at least a month, and it should fall about 10% and maybe more.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It temporarily dropped back below last year’s close, erasing the 2021 gains. On last Friday, I said that there is a 60% chance that this is the start of about an Emini 10 percent correction, and yesterday only reinforced that view. The minimum goal is a drop below the November 9 high, because that was resistance and then support for about a month.<p>The next target is the November 10 low at the start of the wedge bull channel. On the monthly chart, a minimum target is the September high. It could continue down to the September low, which is the bottom of the most recent leg up on the monthly chart.<p>But what about today? The Emini is very oversold on the daily chart. Also, it has had 3 legs down, and therefore the selloff is a wedge sell climax. That typically attracts profit takers, which increases the chance of a bounce for at least a day or two. But at the moment, there is a 60% chance it will work lower over the next few weeks. Traders should sell rallies. The bulls need at least a couple consecutive big bull days to turn the chart back to neutral.<p>Today is Friday, so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the last hour. Magnets include the 2020 close, the 20 week EMA below, the open of the week, and last week’s low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up over 35 points in the Globex session. The day after a sell climax day has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading, starting by the end of the 2nd hour. Also, there is a wedge bottom on the daily chart. Additionally, the Emini reversed up yesterday from a sell climax at the important support of the close of last year, and from just above the 3,700 Big Round Number.<p>Finally, a streak of 3 consecutive big bear days is unusual. Today will probably not be a 4th. In fact, there is an increased chance of today closing above the open. Also, with the selloff being so climactic, there is an increased chance that today will be a bull trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-sell-climax-and-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-5.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and bear trending trading range day.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-breaking-below-trading-range-for-measured-move-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-5-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex breaking below trading range for measured move down\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart yesterday had a big bear bar closing on its low. Today is breaking below the 3-month trading range and so far, it too is a big bear day closing on its low. If today closes on the low, there would be consecutive big bear day in a breakout. Traders will expect a measured move down to the November 4 low at 1.16.<p>While there are 2 bear days, today is the 1st breakout day. Monday is the follow-through day. At a minimum, the bears want at least a small bear body. Consecutive closes below the trading range is a confirmed breakout. It significantly increases the chance of a measured move down.<p>If today reverses up and closes above the February 5 low, or if Monday is a big bull day similar to February 5, traders will wonder if the breakout is failing. The bulls will need a series of bull days, like after February 5, to make traders believe that the selloff is only a big High 2 pullback from the January high.<p>Currently, traders expect the selloff to continue to 1.16. What happens over the next few days will increase or decrease that probability.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has trended down overnight, but it was in a tight trading range until 15 minutes ago. It just broke strongly below that range, but it is reversing up from the 1.19 Big Round Number.<p>A trading range is an area of agreement. Traders think the price is fair. A trading range late in a bear trend is a magnet, and a possible Final Bear Flag.<p>The bulls hope the reversal gets back into that trading range. If it does, then we probably have seen the low of the day. Also, today would have a big tail below on the daily chart. That would reduce the strength of the bear breakout. Monday, then, would be more important. Will it resume the bear breakout on the daily chart or continue the reversal up?<p>When a market reverses back up into a trading range, it can continue up to the high of the day. More often, it gets stuck in that trading range, and again goes sideways. Less often, it resumes down and closes at the low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

I said in the chat room that it would probably reverse up from above yesterday’s low and it did. It then rallied strong to a new high of the day. and above of the 60-minute EMA and the midpoint of the week. It broke above yesterday’s high just before the close. When there is a huge selloff on the open and then a reversal, the Emini usually has a hard time going far above the high of the open. Today was an exception and the rally went quite a bit above the earlier high.<p>Today formed a micro bottom with yesterday’s low on the daily chart. Since there is also a wedge bottom, the Emini might go sideways to up for a couple legs next week. While today was good for the bulls, the daily chart is still slightly more bearish than bullish. The bulls will need consecutive strong bull bars to undo the consecutive big bears bars from this week and from last week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, the week also formed a wedge bull flag on Friday. The odds are still slightly greater for a bear breakout and a 10% correction, but a pair of consecutive big bull bars next week will make traders look for a break above 4,000.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>have been accelerating down in a parabolic wedge sell climax. Since they are in a support zone, they can bounce at any time. Sell rallies. They are in a bear trend.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has been reversing down on the weekly chart from a 10-month wedge rally. They will probably continue down to the November low at 1.16. However, a strong reversal up next week will create a wedge bull flag. Traders will then wonder if the EURUSD will continue up to the February 2018 high, instead of the January low.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures\">30-year Treasury Bond futures</h2><h3 id=\"2-bond-futures-on-weekly-chart-are-in-sell-climax-but-in-support-zone-so-could-bounce-at-any-time\">Bond futures on<em>weekly</em>chart are in sell climax, but in support zone so could bounce at any time</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-sell-climax-at-support-so-likely-short-covering-soon.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-6.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in sell climax at support so likely short covering soon\"></a></figure><p>Bond futures have been in a parabolic wedge sell climax on the weekly chart since the August high. I have been saying that they would fall below the March 18, 2020 sell climax low, and below the February 20, 2020 buy climax low, which they did last week.<p>The bond market formed a big bear bar this week, and it broke slightly below last week’s low. The bears hope next week trades below this week’s low. They want the selloff to continue down to that magnet at the January 2020 low. That was the start of last year’s buy climax, and it is a reliable magnet once there is a reversal down.<p>Bonds will get there, and ultimately much lower, but they might go sideways to up for a couple months first. I keep saying that bonds will be lower in 5 and 10 years from now. Interest rates are going up.<p>The ranges last week and this week were big. A big bar late in a sell climax at support usually attracts profit takers. The tails on last week’s low, and this week’s low were created by bears taking windfall profits (short covering).<p>Will bonds go up in March? There is no evidence for that yet on the weekly chart, although there is now a lower low double bottom on the daily chart (not shown), and a possible micro double bottom on the weekly chart as a result.<p>But even if the bonds reverse up, the reversal will be minor. Traders will sell it, expecting the bear trend to continue down to the January 2020 low.<h2 id=\"3-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-on-the-weekly-chart-is-working-lower-after-a-10-month-wedge-top\">The EURUSD on the<em>weekly</em>chart is working lower after a 10-month wedge top</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-breaking-below-trading-range-but-bulls-want-wedge-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-6-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart breaking below trading range, but bulls want wedge bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart has been sideways to down since the January 6 wedge top. Traders are deciding if the wedge will lead to a test of the November 4 low at 1.16.<p>The alternative is that the selloff is forming a wedge bull flag, and the bull trend will resume up to the 2018 high at 1.2555. If the bulls get a a few big bull bars next week, traders will start to bet on a breakout above the January high. At the moment, it is more likely that the EURUSD will work down to 1.16.<p>Last week was a sell signal bar. When this week went below last week’s low, it triggered the sell signal. This week was a bear bar, which is good for the bears.<p>Also, it closed below the February 5 low, which is the bottom of the 2-month trading range. That increases the chance of a measured move down to the November 4 low. The bears need a couple closes on the daily chart (not shown) below the February 5 low, to convince traders that the EURUSD is heading for 1.16.<p>What about the bulls? Everyone on TV keeps saying that the EURUSD is going higher. While that might be true, it does not mean it will happen next week. It could easily fall to 1.16 before trying again to break above the 6-year trading range at 1.2555.<h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart-has-small-parabolic-wedge-top-but-has-been-sideways-for-4-months\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart has small parabolic wedge top, but has been sideways for 4 months</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-micro-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-6-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a strong bull trend since last year’s pandemic low. But the rally has had 3 small legs up, and it is therefore a parabolic wedge. This month so far is a bear bar doji. If it closes near its low, it will be a sell signal bar for the parabolic wedge top. If it closes near its high, traders will look for 4,000 in April.<p>The wedge began with the September low. It therefore only has 7 bars. If there is a reversal down, traders should not expect TBTL (Ten Bars, Two Legs) on this time frame. That could happen on the weekly chart. That would be a couple legs sideways to down over a couple months on the weekly chart. A couple months means two bars on the monthly chart. Therefore, if February is a top, the reversal down will probably be minor on the monthly chart.<p>When the Emini broke above the February 2020 high, it pulled back below that breakout point a couple months later. In November, the Emini broke above the September high of 3,568.50, but has not yet tested it. Trends tend to become weaker as they age. Therefore, with the September rally reversing down to below its breakout point, traders should expect a pullback to below the September high, which is a breakout point, within the next few months.<p>A reversal down often tests the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the September low at 3189.75, or about 3,200. If the Emini were to get there, the correction would be about 20%. At the moment, the bears have a 30% chance.<p>Can the Emini continue straight up to above the 4,000 Big Round Number? The bull trend has been very strong and there are many several weeks left to March. But, the consecutive big bear bars on the daily chart (see below) make it more likely that a 10% correction is underway.<h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-3-consecutive-bear-bars-but-in-trading-range-with-higher-lows\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has 3 consecutive bear bars, but in trading range with higher lows</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-3-bear-bars-in-buy-climax-at-top-of-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-6-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has 3 bear bars in buy climax at top of channel\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed its 3rd consecutive bear bar this week. The last time this happened was during the 10% corrections in September and in October. Also, the Emini this week broke below the bull trend line from the pandemic low.<p>The selloff has been strong enough for traders to expect at least a 2nd leg sideways to down, after the 1st one or two week bounce. The 1st downside target is the September 9 high. That was the most recent breakout point. It is also near the November 10 low, which was the start of a 3-month bull channel. When a bull channel reverses, it often tests down to where the channel began.<p>Because the yearlong bull trend has been strong, the bulls have a 40% chance of resuming the bull trend, before there is a 2nd leg sideways to down. If the bulls get a bull bar next week, the weekly chart would become neutral again. Consecutive strong bull bars would make the weekly chart bullish again.<h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-should-go-lower-after-3-consecutive-big-bear-bars-despite-a-wedge-bull-flag\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart should go lower after 3 consecutive big bear bars, despite a wedge bull flag</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-bull-flag-after-3-big-bear-bars.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-6-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has wedge bull flag after 3 big bear bars\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had consecutive big bear bars 2 weeks ago, for the 1st time since the 10% corrections in September, and in October. There were 3 consecutive big bear bars this week.<p>I wrote last week that there was a 60% chance of a couple legs down and a 10% correction. But with the big tail below this week’s bar, and the higher lows since November 10, the probability is no longer 60%, but it is still better than 50%.<p>The bears have accomplished several things. The Emini broke below the bull trend line from the October low. Also, it closed the February 2 gap on the daily chart. Additionally, it had 2 consecutive big bear bars 2 weeks ago, and 3 consecutive big bear bars this week. They now need to prevent a big bull bar next week for traders to give up on a 10% correction in March. Otherwise, the chart would be neutral to bullish.<h4 id=\"9-wedge-bull-flag\">Wedge bull flag</h4><p>The Emini has had 3 pushes down, and 3 reversals up over the past few weeks. Since the Emini is in a bull trend, this is a wedge bull flag. Because this week closed above its midpoint, it is a reversal bar and a buy signal bar for next week. However, it has a bear body and the prior 2 weeks were bear bars. This is a weak buy setup. There might be more sellers than buyers above its high.<p>What happens if next week rallies for a couple days and forms a small lower high, and then reverses down below this week’s low? For example, when there is a wedge bull flag, the rally sometimes reverses down from a double top, with either of the 1st 2 legs up. Here, those are the the February 24 and March 1 highs.<p>The stop for the wedge bottom bulls is below the wedge bottom, which is Thursday’s low. If the Emini falls below the wedge, many bulls will give up. Other bulls will buy, betting on a failed breakout. An unknown number of bears will sell as well.<p>One of my general rules is that if a market falls below a wedge or any protective stop, there is a 50% chance that the breakout will fail and the market will reverse up, and a 50% chance that the breakout will lead to a selloff and a measured move down. The percentages can be a little higher or lower, depending on the context (bars to the left) and the bars in the wedge, but this is a useful way to look at wedge buy signals.<p>I bring this up because there is a wedge bull flag, but the past 3 bars had bears bodies. Therefore, this is a lower probability buy setup. If it triggers, it is good to have an idea of what will happen it the buy fails, and there is a downside breakout.<h4 id=\"10-what-about-next-week\">What about next week?</h4><p>Whenever a market is unable to get a sustained move up or down, it is in a trading range. The Emini has been in a trading range all year. Traders are buying low, selling high, and taking quick profits. This will continue until there is a strong breakout up or down, and there is follow-through. Until then, traders will continue to look for reversals every few days.<p>As I said, because of the 3 big consecutive bear bars this week, and the 2 big bear bars 2 weeks ago, the odds of a bear breakout are slightly better. But the bulls only need consecutive strong bull bars to make traders expect a break above 4,000.<h2 id=\"11-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Since it had a big tail below, Friday formed a micro double bottom with Thursday. It is a buy signal bar for today. But after 3 big bear days, this is probably a minor buy signal.<p>There is also a wedge bull flag on the daily chart. That makes it likely that the bulls will get at least a couple small legs sideways to up this week. The chart is now almost back to neutral.<p>But if there is a rally, and it turns down from either the February 24 or March 1 lower highs, there will be a double top lower high major trend reversal. A break below this week’s low, which would be the neckline, could lead to a measured move down.<p>Despite the strong legs up and down for the past couple weeks, the Emini is still in February’s trading range. The bulls need consecutive strong bull bars to undo the bearishness of 3 consecutive strong bear bars last week, and 2 more from the week before.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 3 points in the Globex session. If it gaps up, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>Because Friday is a buy signal bar, for a wedge buy flag in a bull trend on the daily chart, today will probably trade above Friday’s high. That will trigger the daily buy signal. The bulls are hoping that last year’s bull trend is resuming.<p>Friday’s strong reversal up makes it likely that the Emini will trade at least a little higher this week. However, the bulls will need a 2nd consecutive big bull day today to undo last week’s 3 consecutive big bear days. Therefore, traders expect that if today will be a bull day on the daily chart, it will probably not be a big bull day closing on its high.<p>Friday was an extreme buy climax on the 5-minute chart. There is therefore a 75% chance that the Emini will begin at least 2 hours of sideways to down trading by the end of the 2nd hour. Also, there is only a 25% chance that today will be another extremely strong bull trend day.<p>The open will be important. If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, there will be an increased chance of a strong trend day. Since an early trading range trading is likely, traders will expect any early sharp leg up or down to reverse. If there is a trading range open, it reduces the chance of a big trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/0_Blog-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-8.png\" alt=\"Emini bull flag micro double bottom set up on daily chart\"></a><figcaption>Above is the version that I post every day.<br>Because I often get questions about what subscribers to Daily Setups see, today I am including the example below of that version.</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/0_Blog-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-8-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-breaking-below-neckline-of-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-8-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex breaking below neckline of double top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is breaking below a 3-month trading range. The bears want a measured move down based on the 400-pip height of the range. That would be down to the November 4 major higher low.<p>The February 5 low is also the neckline of the January 22/February 16 double top. The breakout above failed, and the EURUSD has been breaking below for a couple days. That measured move target is just below the November 11 low. That was the start of the bull channel after the spike up in early November, and the start of a channel is always a magnet.<p>While its possible that the selloff will collapse to the November 11 and November 4 lows, that is unlikely. Remember, the EURUSD was in a trading range for 3 months until this week. That November 4 low was the bottom of another 3-month trading range. That means that most of the trading since the end of July has been sideways. Since the EURUSD is still in that range, it is more likely to soon begin to convert into a trading range again.<p>A new trading range might not be obvious until after the EURUSD falls to the November 11 low, but the EURUSD will probably bounce this week. This is because February 26 was a spike down, and the past 4 days are forming a parabolic wedge bear channel. It is easier to see on the 15- or 60-minute charts.<p>This is a sell climax, and it should attract profit takers soon. That should lead to a bounce for at least a day or two, and it could begin a test above the February 5 low, which is a breakout point.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight, but the selloff has been in a fairly broad channel. Also, the daily chart has sold off strongly for 4 days, which is extreme. Day trading bears will begin to take profits below prior lows on the 5-minute chart and switch to selling rallies instead of at the market.<p>There have been many reversals up overnight. While none has yet been 20-pips, the bulls are starting to buy, expecting more sustained profit taking from the bears. In general, when looking to buy in a bear trend, a trader has a better chance of making money after he sees other bulls making money. That usually requires at least a 20-pip bounce.<p>Also, today’s range is already fairly big. That reduces the chance that it will get much bigger. Therefore, even though the EURUSD has been in a strong bear trend for 4 days, traders will expect some short covering today and tomorrow and a transition into a trading range on the 5- and 60-minute charts.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-8-3.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

While it broke above Friday’s high and triggered a High 1 and wedge bull flag buy signal, it failed to rally strongly above Friday’s high.

Since it had a big tail below, Friday formed a micro double bottom with Thursday. It is a buy signal bar for today. But after 3 big bear days, this is probably a minor buy signal.<p>There is also a wedge bull flag on the daily chart. That makes it likely that the bulls will get at least a couple small legs sideways to up this week. The chart is now almost back to neutral.<p>But if there is a rally, and it turns down from either the February 24 or March 1 lower highs, there will be a double top lower high major trend reversal. A break below this week’s low, which would be the neckline, could lead to a measured move down.<p>Despite the strong legs up and down for the past couple weeks, the Emini is still in February’s trading range. The bulls need consecutive strong bull bars to undo the bearishness of 3 consecutive strong bear bars last week, and 2 more from the week before.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 3 points in the Globex session. If it gaps up, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>Because Friday is a buy signal bar, for a wedge buy flag in a bull trend on the daily chart, today will probably trade above Friday’s high. That will trigger the daily buy signal. The bulls are hoping that last year’s bull trend is resuming.<p>Friday’s strong reversal up makes it likely that the Emini will trade at least a little higher this week. However, the bulls will need a 2nd consecutive big bull day today to undo last week’s 3 consecutive big bear days. Therefore, traders expect that if today will be a bull day on the daily chart, it will probably not be a big bull day closing on its high.<p>Friday was an extreme buy climax on the 5-minute chart. There is therefore a 75% chance that the Emini will begin at least 2 hours of sideways to down trading by the end of the 2nd hour. Also, there is only a 25% chance that today will be another extremely strong bull trend day.<p>The open will be important. If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, there will be an increased chance of a strong trend day. Since an early trading range trading is likely, traders will expect any early sharp leg up or down to reverse. If there is a trading range open, it reduces the chance of a big trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/0_Blog-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-8.png\" alt=\"Emini bull flag micro double bottom set up on daily chart\"></a><figcaption>Above is the version that I post every day.<br>Because I often get questions about what subscribers to Daily Setups see, today I am including the example below of that version.</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/0_Blog-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-8-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

The bears want a measured move down based on the 400-pip height of the range. That would be down to the November 4 major higher low.<p>The February 5 low is also the neckline of the January 22/February 16 double top. The breakout above failed, and the EURUSD has been breaking below for a couple days. That measured move target is just below the November 11 low. That was the start of the bull channel after the spike up in early November, and the start of a channel is always a magnet.<p>While its possible that the selloff will collapse to the November 11 and November 4 lows, that is unlikely. Remember, the EURUSD was in a trading range for 3 months until this week. That November 4 low was the bottom of another 3-month trading range. That means that most of the trading since the end of July has been sideways. Since the EURUSD is still in that range, it is more likely to soon begin to convert into a trading range again.<p>A new trading range might not be obvious until after the EURUSD falls to the November 11 low, but the EURUSD will probably bounce this week. This is because February 26 was a spike down, and the past 4 days are forming a parabolic wedge bear channel. It is easier to see on the 15- or 60-minute charts.<p>This is a sell climax, and it should attract profit takers soon. That should lead to a bounce for at least a day or two, and it could begin a test above the February 5 low, which is a breakout point.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight, but the selloff has been in a fairly broad channel. Also, the daily chart has sold off strongly for 4 days, which is extreme. Day trading bears will begin to take profits below prior lows on the 5-minute chart and switch to selling rallies instead of at the market.<p>There have been many reversals up overnight. While none has yet been 20-pips, the bulls are starting to buy, expecting more sustained profit taking from the bears. In general, when looking to buy in a bear trend, a trader has a better chance of making money after he sees other bulls making money. That usually requires at least a 20-pip bounce.<p>Also, today’s range is already fairly big. That reduces the chance that it will get much bigger. Therefore, even though the EURUSD has been in a strong bear trend for 4 days, traders will expect some short covering today and tomorrow and a transition into a trading range on the 5- and 60-minute charts.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-8-3.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini is also in the middle of a 3-week trading range. They have been buying selloffs and selling rallies, which has created the trading range. Trading ranges are generally neutral. This one is slightly more bearish because of last week’s 3 consecutive bear days. Therefore, the odds of a bear breakout and a measured move down are greater than for a bull breakout.<p>Yesterday broke above Friday’s high and triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal. It was also a wedge bull flag buy signal. But it closed near its low, and it is now a Low 1 sell signal bar. It is also the 4th lower high in an early bear channel.<p>The bulls hope that yesterday is just a pullback from Monday’s strong reversal up. They might get a rally this week to the February 24 and March 1 lower highs. But they will need either consecutive big bull bars or a strong break above the February 24 lower high to flip the odds back in their favor. If the bears can get a reversal down from either of those highs, there would be a double top lower high major trend reversal on the daily chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex session. Yesterday sold off in a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. The start of the channel was the bounce back up to the open of the month at 11:35 am PST. The Emini is currently back there in the Globex session.<p>The start of a bear channel is always a magnet once there is a reversal up. The market then typically enters a trading range. With the Emini also in the middle of a 3-week trading range and within a 3-month trading range, there is an increased chance of trading range trading on the 5-minute chart today. This is especially true with a reversal up from yesterday’s Spike and Channel Bear Trend.<p>Can today instead be a big trend day up or down? That is possible any day, but a trading day is more likely. The daily ranges have been big so there should be at least one swing up and one swing down today, but today will probably have a lot of sideways trading after all of the recent reversals.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-9.png\" alt=\"Emini higher high major trend reversal.

This is now a confirmed breakout, which makes a measured move down to the November 4 low likely.<p>But that does not mean straight down. The selloff is a parabolic Spike and Channel sell climax, where February 26 is the spike, and the channel began on March 3. That typically attracts profit taking (short covering), which might have started overnight. It could last a couple weeks, and get back to the start of the bear channel around the March 3 high. At a minimum, there should be a bounce above the February 5 low within a week.<p>Why is the EURUSD pausing here? It is testing the September 2018 top of the 2018 bear channel<p>Can the breakout fail? Every breakout always has at least a 40% chance of failing. The bulls will need several strong bull days and probably at least a micro double bottom to have a chance of a trend reversal.<p>Right now, it is more likely that the short covering will last 1- to 3-days and then the selloff will continue down to the November 11 low. That was the start of the bull channel after the March 9 spike up. The EURUSD should reach the November 4 low within a couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly overnight but has pulled back 30 pips over the past 3 hours. That is enough for day traders to expect a trading range. They were only buying since yesterday’s close, but they now will be willing to sell rallies as well, betting on a trading range instead of a continuation of the strong short covering rally.<p>Can the EURUSD continue the reversal back down to the low of the session? After such a strong rally in an extreme sell climax on the daily chart, the selloff will probably not get much below 1.19. The EURUSD should be sideways to up for the remainder of the session.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow. If the week can close near its high, next week should be higher as well.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini is also in the middle of a 3-week trading range. They have been buying selloffs and selling rallies, which has created the trading range. Trading ranges are generally neutral. This one is slightly more bearish because of last week’s 3 consecutive bear days. Therefore, the odds of a bear breakout and a measured move down are greater than for a bull breakout.<p>Yesterday broke above Friday’s high and triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal. It was also a wedge bull flag buy signal. But it closed near its low, and it is now a Low 1 sell signal bar. It is also the 4th lower high in an early bear channel.<p>The bulls hope that yesterday is just a pullback from Monday’s strong reversal up. They might get a rally this week to the February 24 and March 1 lower highs. But they will need either consecutive big bull bars or a strong break above the February 24 lower high to flip the odds back in their favor. If the bears can get a reversal down from either of those highs, there would be a double top lower high major trend reversal on the daily chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex session. Yesterday sold off in a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. The start of the channel was the bounce back up to the open of the month at 11:35 am PST. The Emini is currently back there in the Globex session.<p>The start of a bear channel is always a magnet once there is a reversal up. The market then typically enters a trading range. With the Emini also in the middle of a 3-week trading range and within a 3-month trading range, there is an increased chance of trading range trading on the 5-minute chart today. This is especially true with a reversal up from yesterday’s Spike and Channel Bear Trend.<p>Can today instead be a big trend day up or down? That is possible any day, but a trading day is more likely. The daily ranges have been big so there should be at least one swing up and one swing down today, but today will probably have a lot of sideways trading after all of the recent reversals.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-9.png\" alt=\"Emini higher high major trend reversal.

This is now a confirmed breakout, which makes a measured move down to the November 4 low likely.<p>But that does not mean straight down. The selloff is a parabolic Spike and Channel sell climax, where February 26 is the spike, and the channel began on March 3. That typically attracts profit taking (short covering), which might have started overnight. It could last a couple weeks, and get back to the start of the bear channel around the March 3 high. At a minimum, there should be a bounce above the February 5 low within a week.<p>Why is the EURUSD pausing here? It is testing the September 2018 top of the 2018 bear channel<p>Can the breakout fail?

There have been many strong legs up and down, but every one reversed. Yesterday was another example. The Emini rallied but could not hold above 3,900, and closed in the bottom third of its range (Emini another lower high).<p>This rally is a test of 3,900 and the March 4 and the February 24 lower highs. Last week’s streak of 3 big bear bars was the most sustained selling since the 10% corrections in September and October.<p>As long as the Emini continues to make lower highs, it is in an early bear channel. But because it has been sideways for a month, the bears only have a slightly higher probability of a downside breakout, than the bulls have of a breakout above the 4,000 Big Round Number. The bulls need a strong break above the February 24 lower high to flip the odds in their favor.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up over 20 points in the Globex session. The bulls want the rally to test the February 24 lower high, which is a magnet above. Right now, the Emini is struggling with the 3,900 Big Round Number, as it has been for a month.<p>Because there is room to that lower high, and the 3-day reversal has been reasonably strong, traders expect at least slightly higher prices. However, each of the past 4 days has had reversals. Day traders expect at least one reversal today.<p>Since the daily ranges have been big, the legs in the reversals have been swing trades. For example, yesterday began with a strong bull trend, and ended with a strong bear trend. Also, with the Emini in the middle of a 3-week trading range, and with yesterday being Big Up, Big Down, there is an increased chance of a trading range day, which means more than one reversal. Can today be a big trend day up or down? While it might begin that way like yesterday, day traders are expecting at least one reversal.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-bear-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-10.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-bottom-and-short-covering-in-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-10-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex wedge bottom and short covering in sell climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart formed a bull reversal bar yesterday in an extreme sell climax. It was caused by the bears taking profits.<p>The short covering might only last a day, like on March 2, but this selloff is extreme. The move down from the February 25 high is a parabolic wedge. Also, there is a wedge bull channel with the January 1 and February 5 lows. At a minimum, there should be a pullback above the February 5 breakout point by the end of next week. The short covering could continue for a couple weeks and reach the March 3 high.<p>What traders are now deciding is if yesterday will be the low, or if there will be one more brief low first. The November 4 low is an important magnet on the weekly chart. The EURUSD will probably get there within a couple months. But it will likely work higher over the next couple weeks, even if there is one more brief new low first.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways over night. It’s high is below yesterday’s high and its low is above yesterday’s low. It is an inside day so far.<p>This is the 4th consecutive day when it is testing 1.19. The bulls want today to go above yesterday’s high and trigger a buy signal.

However, the reversal has not been strong, and the EURUSD has spent move of the time in small trading ranges on the 5 minute chart. Day traders are buying and selling for scalps.

There have been many strong legs up and down, but every one reversed. Yesterday was another example. The Emini rallied but could not hold above 3,900, and closed in the bottom third of its range (Emini another lower high).<p>This rally is a test of 3,900 and the March 4 and the February 24 lower highs. Last week’s streak of 3 big bear bars was the most sustained selling since the 10% corrections in September and October.<p>As long as the Emini continues to make lower highs, it is in an early bear channel. But because it has been sideways for a month, the bears only have a slightly higher probability of a downside breakout, than the bulls have of a breakout above the 4,000 Big Round Number. The bulls need a strong break above the February 24 lower high to flip the odds in their favor.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up over 20 points in the Globex session. The bulls want the rally to test the February 24 lower high, which is a magnet above. Right now, the Emini is struggling with the 3,900 Big Round Number, as it has been for a month.<p>Because there is room to that lower high, and the 3-day reversal has been reasonably strong, traders expect at least slightly higher prices. However, each of the past 4 days has had reversals. Day traders expect at least one reversal today.<p>Since the daily ranges have been big, the legs in the reversals have been swing trades. For example, yesterday began with a strong bull trend, and ended with a strong bear trend. Also, with the Emini in the middle of a 3-week trading range, and with yesterday being Big Up, Big Down, there is an increased chance of a trading range day, which means more than one reversal. Can today be a big trend day up or down? While it might begin that way like yesterday, day traders are expecting at least one reversal.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-bear-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-10.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It was caused by the bears taking profits.<p>The short covering might only last a day, like on March 2, but this selloff is extreme. The move down from the February 25 high is a parabolic wedge. Also, there is a wedge bull channel with the January 1 and February 5 lows. At a minimum, there should be a pullback above the February 5 breakout point by the end of next week. The short covering could continue for a couple weeks and reach the March 3 high.<p>What traders are now deciding is if yesterday will be the low, or if there will be one more brief low first. The November 4 low is an important magnet on the weekly chart. The EURUSD will probably get there within a couple months. But it will likely work higher over the next couple weeks, even if there is one more brief new low first.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways over night. It’s high is below yesterday’s high and its low is above yesterday’s low. It is an inside day so far.<p>This is the 4th consecutive day when it is testing 1.19. The bulls want today to go above yesterday’s high and trigger a buy signal. That would increase the chance that the EURUSD has put in a minor low.<p>The bears, however, want today to close near its low.

It tested the 3,900 Big Round Number, like most days since early February. It is also testing the February 24 lower high.<p>Even though the Emini rallied for 4 days, it has been in a trading range since early February and stuck at 3900 Big Round Number. Unless the bulls break strongly above the February 24 lower high, and the February 16 all-time high, it is still slightly more likely to drop 10% from a double top before breaking above 4,000. This is because of the streak of 3 consecutive strong bear days last week. However, one big bull day would flip the odds in favor of 4,000.<p>With yesterday being a small day at the 3,900 magnet, there is an increased chance of today having a lot of trading range price action as well. This is true even it it rallies 30 points to the all-time high.<p>But because the Emini has been testing an important price for a month, there is an increased chance of a big trend day in either direction. If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the 1st hour, the odds of a trend day will go up.<p>Today is rollover day in the Emini. June is now the front month. However, March will still have much greater volume through the end of the day. Therefore, most traders will trade March today and then June starting tomorrow.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 22 points in the Globex session. It therefore might break above yesterday’s high. If it does and the gap is small, it will probably close in the 1st hour.<p>Today’s open will be important. If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, there would be an increased chance of a trend day. If the bulls get an early, strong trend, today could be a big bull day, and break to a new all-time high.<p>Can the bears get an equally strong big bear day? Probably not. This is because the 4-day rally has been in a tight bull channel on the 60-minute chart. It will likely have to go sideways for another day or so, before the bears have a reasonable chance of a strong reversal down.<p>What is most likely? The Emini is at the top of a 5-week trading range. Most days have had at least one swing up and one swing down. The Emini will probably have at least a couple swings again today. Also, it is likely to spend a lot of time going sideways, like most days for the past month. If there is a trend, it will more likely be a weaker trend, like a channel or a Trending Trading Range Day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-11.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day oscillating and stuck at 3900 big round number\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Since there were 3 legs down, this is a wedge bottom reversal attempt.<p>All reversals up from sell climaxes begin with short covering. I said that the EURUSD should break above the February 5 low this week. It did overnight.<p>But how far up will it go? If the bears get a strong bear bar today, there might be one more push down before a 2-week rally. If not, the current rally will probably last a couple weeks and have a couple legs. It could test the March 3 lower high, which was the top of the most recent sell climax.<p>Tomorrow is Friday and this week is becoming a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. The more the week closes on the high, the more traders will expect higher prices next week. The week will probably not close back at the low, so the EURUSD will probably be sideways to up for at least another week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied in the Asian session to above the February 5 breakout point. However, it has been in a tight trading range for the 6 hours since. Day traders have been buying and selling for 10-pip scalps.<p>Will the bears get a bear breakout and turn today into a Low 1 sell signal bar on the daily chart?

It tested the 3,900 Big Round Number, like most days since early February. It is also testing the February 24 lower high.<p>Even though the Emini rallied for 4 days, it has been in a trading range since early February and stuck at 3900 Big Round Number. Unless the bulls break strongly above the February 24 lower high, and the February 16 all-time high, it is still slightly more likely to drop 10% from a double top before breaking above 4,000. This is because of the streak of 3 consecutive strong bear days last week. However, one big bull day would flip the odds in favor of 4,000.<p>With yesterday being a small day at the 3,900 magnet, there is an increased chance of today having a lot of trading range price action as well. This is true even it it rallies 30 points to the all-time high.<p>But because the Emini has been testing an important price for a month, there is an increased chance of a big trend day in either direction. If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the 1st hour, the odds of a trend day will go up.<p>Today is rollover day in the Emini. June is now the front month. However, March will still have much greater volume through the end of the day. Therefore, most traders will trade March today and then June starting tomorrow.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 22 points in the Globex session. It therefore might break above yesterday’s high. If it does and the gap is small, it will probably close in the 1st hour.<p>Today’s open will be important. If there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction, there would be an increased chance of a trend day. If the bulls get an early, strong trend, today could be a big bull day, and break to a new all-time high.<p>Can the bears get an equally strong big bear day? Probably not. This is because the 4-day rally has been in a tight bull channel on the 60-minute chart. It will likely have to go sideways for another day or so, before the bears have a reasonable chance of a strong reversal down.<p>What is most likely? The Emini is at the top of a 5-week trading range. Most days have had at least one swing up and one swing down. The Emini will probably have at least a couple swings again today. Also, it is likely to spend a lot of time going sideways, like most days for the past month. If there is a trend, it will more likely be a weaker trend, like a channel or a Trending Trading Range Day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-11.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day oscillating and stuck at 3900 big round number\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Since there were 3 legs down, this is a wedge bottom reversal attempt.<p>All reversals up from sell climaxes begin with short covering. I said that the EURUSD should break above the February 5 low this week. It did overnight.<p>But how far up will it go? If the bears get a strong bear bar today, there might be one more push down before a 2-week rally. If not, the current rally will probably last a couple weeks and have a couple legs. It could test the March 3 lower high, which was the top of the most recent sell climax.<p>Tomorrow is Friday and this week is becoming a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. The more the week closes on the high, the more traders will expect higher prices next week. The week will probably not close back at the low, so the EURUSD will probably be sideways to up for at least another week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied in the Asian session to above the February 5 breakout point. However, it has been in a tight trading range for the 6 hours since. Day traders have been buying and selling for 10-pip scalps.<p>Will the bears get a bear breakout and turn today into a Low 1 sell signal bar on the daily chart? Or, will the bulls either keep the day sideways or get a 2nd leg up? If the bulls win, tomorrow will probably be sideways to up as well.<p>So far, the EURUSD is paying a lot of attention to the February 5 low. It could continue sideways and then close a little above or below it.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The break above the February 24 lower high erased the bearishness of last week’s 3 consecutive bear bars. The bears gave up, at least for the moment.<p>When one side gives up, there is usually at least a small 2nd leg up. Consequently, traders will likely buy the 1st 1- to 3-day pullback. Therefore, there is not much downside risk over the next few days.<p>The bears want the breakout to fail. With yesterday’s tail on top, and with the 6-day micro channel, there is an increased chance that today will trade below yesterday’s low. A reversal down would be from a higher high double top. But since traders will buy the 1st reversal down, the bears will need at least a micro double top before they can get more than a minor reversal.<p>The next target above is the 4,000 Big Round Number. Will the Emini break above it? I have been saying for months that it should, but the odds favored a pullback first. Now, the odds favor at least a test of 4,000 within about a week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down over 10 points in the Globex session. While yesterday broke to a new high, the size of midday reversal down was disappointing for the bulls. Big Up, Big Down creates Big Confusion. When traders are uncertain, they tend to buy low, sell high, and take quick profits. There is therefore an increased chance of a trading range day today.<p>Also, with yesterday’s weak close and a 6-day bull micro channel on the daily chart, the bears will try to get today to break below yesterday’s low. That would trigger a double top (with the February 16 high) sell signal. However, there probably will be more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low.<p>With today being Friday, weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the last hour. The most important magnets below are the February 24 high and the last week’s high. Also, the 3,900 Big round Number is a magnet. For the bulls, they want the week to close above the February 16 high and the 3,950 Big Round Number.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-12.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday is a Low1 sell signal bar, and the November 4 low is a magnet below.<p>However, the selloff was extreme and therefore climactic. Also, there have been 3 legs down from the January high, and therefore the bear channel is a wedge. The 3-day reversal up was strong enough for traders to expect at least a small 2nd leg up. Also, yesterday was a bull bar closing near its high, and therefore a weak sell signal bar for today. Consequently, while yesterday is a sell signal bar in a bear trend, there probably are more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>Today is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important. The EURUSD is now trading just above the open of the week, so the weekly candlestick is a bull doji, which is slightly bullish. The bulls want the week to close on its high. This week would then be a good buy signal bar on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week. But the bears want lower prices. Their odds will go up if this week has a bear body and closes below the midpoint.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight from yesterday’s close. It traded below yesterday’s low and completely reversed yesterday’s rally. The bears want today to close near its low. Today would then be the 2nd bar of a 2-bar reversal on the daily chart. Traders would see today as a better sell signal bar for Monday. Also, if the week closes below its midpoint, fewer traders would be willing to buy above this week’s high.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the open. After the overnight strong selloff, today will probably not close at the high of the week, so this week will likely not be a strong buy signal bar on the weekly chart. The best the bulls probably can get is a close above the open of the week. The reversal up over the past 3 hours was big enough, so that the bulls have at least a 50% chance of achieving their goal.<p>Day traders only sold early in the session, but they bought below yesterday’s low, and the EURUSD has rallied 30 pips over the past 3 hours. That is enough so that bulls will buy pullbacks. Since a reversal up to yesterday’s high is unlikely, today will probably be sideways. Day traders will look to scalp in both directions. The fight will be over the close of the week. The bulls will try to get the week to close above the open and the bears want a bear close on the weekly chart. This week will probably close near the open, with either a small bull or bear body on the weekly chart.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and weak bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The break above the February 24 lower high erased the bearishness of last week’s 3 consecutive bear bars. The bears gave up, at least for the moment.<p>When one side gives up, there is usually at least a small 2nd leg up. Consequently, traders will likely buy the 1st 1- to 3-day pullback. Therefore, there is not much downside risk over the next few days.<p>The bears want the breakout to fail. With yesterday’s tail on top, and with the 6-day micro channel, there is an increased chance that today will trade below yesterday’s low. A reversal down would be from a higher high double top. But since traders will buy the 1st reversal down, the bears will need at least a micro double top before they can get more than a minor reversal.<p>The next target above is the 4,000 Big Round Number. Will the Emini break above it? I have been saying for months that it should, but the odds favored a pullback first. Now, the odds favor at least a test of 4,000 within about a week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down over 10 points in the Globex session. While yesterday broke to a new high, the size of midday reversal down was disappointing for the bulls. Big Up, Big Down creates Big Confusion. When traders are uncertain, they tend to buy low, sell high, and take quick profits. There is therefore an increased chance of a trading range day today.<p>Also, with yesterday’s weak close and a 6-day bull micro channel on the daily chart, the bears will try to get today to break below yesterday’s low. That would trigger a double top (with the February 16 high) sell signal. However, there probably will be more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low.<p>With today being Friday, weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the last hour. The most important magnets below are the February 24 high and the last week’s high. Also, the 3,900 Big round Number is a magnet. For the bulls, they want the week to close above the February 16 high and the 3,950 Big Round Number.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-12.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday is a Low1 sell signal bar, and the November 4 low is a magnet below.<p>However, the selloff was extreme and therefore climactic. Also, there have been 3 legs down from the January high, and therefore the bear channel is a wedge. The 3-day reversal up was strong enough for traders to expect at least a small 2nd leg up. Also, yesterday was a bull bar closing near its high, and therefore a weak sell signal bar for today. Consequently, while yesterday is a sell signal bar in a bear trend, there probably are more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>Today is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important. The EURUSD is now trading just above the open of the week, so the weekly candlestick is a bull doji, which is slightly bullish. The bulls want the week to close on its high. This week would then be a good buy signal bar on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week. But the bears want lower prices. Their odds will go up if this week has a bear body and closes below the midpoint.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight from yesterday’s close. It traded below yesterday’s low and completely reversed yesterday’s rally. The bears want today to close near its low. Today would then be the 2nd bar of a 2-bar reversal on the daily chart.

Friday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The<strong>Bond futures</strong>market has gone sideways for 3 weeks in a sell climax. While it might fall a little further, traders expect some short covering soon.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market formed a weak buy signal bar for a wedge bull flag on the weekly chart. This should lead to at least slightly higher prices next week.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures\">30-year Treasury Bond futures</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-bond-futures-weekly-chart-sell-climax-is-losing-some-momentum\">The Bond futures<em>weekly</em>chart sell climax is losing some momentum</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range-in-sell-climax-near-support.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-13.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in tight trading range in sell climax near support\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures have collapsed into a support zone between the August 2018 high and the January 2020 low. I have been saying for a year that the first reversal down, from an extreme buy climax, typically reverses all the way down to the start of the most recent leg up. On the monthly chart (not shown), that is the January 2020 low. Bonds should get there are some point this year, but there might be short covering first, since the sell climax is so extreme.<p>The bears only have a 30% chance of the collapse continuing to far below the January 20 low, without a short covering rally first. One of the problems the bears face is the stop for their shorts is far above. The simplest way to reduce risk is to reduce the position size.<p>That means the bears should begin to take some profits soon. When the bears take profits, they are covering some of their shorts, and this creates a short covering rally. Every bull trend begins with a short covering rally. But the 1st rally in a strong bear trend usually only leads to a bear flag, and not a bull trend.<p>The past 3 weeks have largely overlapped one another, which means there is some loss of momentum. This is an early sign of minor short covering, and it increases the chance that there will be a short covering rally soon. The bulls need to see some bull bars before they will buy. Once the short covering begins, the minimum traders will expect is a couple legs up for several weeks. Many big bull bars closing on their highs could lead to a big short covering rally, that could last a couple months.<p>There are now 8 consecutive bear bars, which is unusual and therefore climactic. When there is an extreme sell climax, and the market is just above major support, there is often a short covering reversal up before reaching the support.<p>If a reversal up and a resumption down are going to be minor, what should traders expect for the next several months? When traders are quick to take profits and look to sell rallies and buy pullbacks, the market usually forms a trading range. Traders expect the sell climax to evolve into a trading range within the next few weeks.<h2 id=\"3-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"4-the-eurusd-weekly-chart-has-wedge-bull-flag\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart has wedge bull flag</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-wedge-bull-flag-after-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-13-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart in wedge bull flag after wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart has been selling off for 3 months from a wedge top. However, it reversed up this week and closed with a small bull body, just below the 1.20 Big Round Number. It is therefore a weak buy signal bar for next week.<p>There have been 3 legs down, and the selloff is therefore a wedge bull flag. That will attract buyers next week. At a minimum, traders expect next week to go above this week’s high, which would trigger the buy signal. They want to know if there will be more buyers or sellers above this week’s high.<p>The bulls hope this will be a resumption of last year’s bull trend. If next week is a big bull bar closing on its high, it will erase last week’s bear bar. That would make the weekly chart neutral again. If there are a couple consecutive big bull bars, the bulls will be back in control.<h3 id=\"5-what-if-there-is-no-follow-through-buying\">What if there is no follow-through buying?</h3><p>But what if next week does not go above this week’s high? Or, if it does, but is a bear bar? Traders will conclude that the 2-week rally is just a minor bounce in the bear channel that began on January 6.<p>Which is more likely, a resumption of the bull trend or a continuation of the bear channel? The weekly chart has been reversing every couple weeks, since the yearlong wedge top 3 months ago. This week is another reversal. Since there is now a wedge bear channel, which is a bull flag, it creates confusion. Traders need more information before they can form a strong opinion, and that means more bars.<p>The odds favor at least slightly higher prices next week, and sideways to up trading for at least a couple weeks. At that point, traders will have a better idea of the direction over the next couple months.<h2 id=\"6-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"7-the-monthly-emini-chart-is-in-a-strong-bull-trend\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart is in a strong bull trend</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-3rd-leg-up-so-parabolic-wedge-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has 3rd leg up so parabolic wedge bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has a bull bar closing near its high so far in March. The yearlong bull trend has been very strong and there is no top yet. Even once the bears get a reversal down, it will probably be minor. That means a 1- or 2-bar (month) pullback.<p>However, extreme buy climaxes attract profit takers. This current leg up began in September. Theoretically, the bulls have stops below the September low. That is 20% down, which means the risk is big. The easiest way to reduce risk is to reduce the position size.<p>At some point, there will be enough bulls taking profits to create a pullback. However, when a trend is this strong, there will be many bulls eager to buy below the low of the prior bar. That should limit the pullback to a month or two.<h3 id=\"8-small-parabolic-wedge\">Small parabolic wedge</h3><p>The rally from the September low is the 3rd push up from the pandemic low. A reversal down would therefore form a parabolic wedge top. That often can lead to a TBTL (Ten Bar, Two Leg) pullback, but not when the rally is only 13 bars. If there is a TBTL pullback, it will be on a smaller time frame, like the weekly or daily charts. It could therefore last a couple months, which means a couple bars on the monthly chart.<p>Will the bull trend resume after the 1st pullback? While that is likely, it could also evolve into a trading range, and that could last many bars. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can create a significant reversal down. A micro double top requires at least a few sideways bars. Therefore the downside risk is small over the next couple months.<p>Because this is a monthly chart, a 2-month pullback could even be 20%. However, since the bears will likely need a micro double top before they can get a trend reversal, traders will be eager to buy the pullback.<h3 id=\"9-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-breaking-above-double-bottom-bull-flag\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart breaking above double bottom bull flag</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-double-bottom-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-13-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has double bottom bull flag. Should test 4000 Big Round Number next week.\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a big bull bar this week, and broke to a new all-time high. However, it closed just below the February 16 high, and therefore the bulls were not as strong as they could have been. Last week was a High 1 buy signal bar, and this week triggered the weekly buy signal when it went above last week’s high.<p>Last week also formed a higher low double bottom bull flag with the January 29 low. The February 16 all-time high is the neckline. Now, the bulls want a 250-point measured move up based on the height of the double bottom. Also, the Emini has been in a trading range all year, and that double bottom is near the bottom of the range. A measured move up would be the same 250 points.<h3 id=\"10-4000-big-round-number-is-a-magnet-just-above\">4,000 Big Round Number is a magnet just above</h3><p>Will the bulls get their measured move target? There is another more important target that they have to clear first. That is the 4,000 Big Round Number. The rally stalled at every Big Round Number since 3,500 in September. Even if the Emini ultimately goes far above 4,000 this year, it will probably go sideways for at least a week or two once it gets to 4,000. Trades will then decide if the Emini will continue up or reverse down.<h3 id=\"11-what-can-the-bears-expect\">What can the bears expect?</h3><p>What about the bears? The past 3 weeks had bear bodies. Therefore, the buy signal was weak. When a weak buy signal triggers, there is a higher probability that it will reverse down within a few weeks. The resistance of the 4,000 Big Round Number increases the chance of a reversal. However, this week was a surprisingly good bull bar, and a Bull Surprise normally has at least some follow-through within a couple bars. Therefore, the risk of a major reversal down next week is small.<p>But can the bears get at least a minor reversal? A minor reversal can come at any time in any trend. The Emini has been reversing every week or two all year. However, if next week is a bear bar, it is more likely to lead to a brief sideways to down move than a major trend reversal.<p>The Emini will probably test 4,000 next week. If it does, it is more likely to stall for a couple weeks than immediately reverse down.<h3 id=\"12-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-breaking-above-neckline-of-double-bottom\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart breaking above neckline of double bottom</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-high-1-bull-flag-but-possible-double-top-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-13-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has high 1 bull flag but possible double top\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke to a new all-time high this week, but closed just below the old high. That old high is the neckline of the January 29/March 4 double bottom. As I mentioned above, the bulls want a 250 point measured move up. The bulls need consecutive closes above the February 16 neckline to confirm the breakout. That would increase the chance of another leg up.<p>This breakout is particularly important, because the bears had 3 consecutive big bear bars last week, which was good for the bears. When they had 2 consecutive big bear bars in September and again in October, the bears got 10% corrections both times. Traders expected that this time would repeat the pattern. But once the Emini broke above the top of the 3 bear bars, the bears gave up.<p>When one side gives up, the breakout typically will have at least a small 2nd leg. Therefore, the bulls will look to buy the 1st reversal down, which they did on Friday. Friday is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for Monday. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices on Monday.<h3 id=\"13-cant-this-be-a-double-top\">Can’t this be a double top?</h3><p>Any test of a prior high can reverse down from a double top. The 2nd leg up in a double top is usually weaker than the first. It is often a wedge bull channel.<p>But about a 3rd of the time, the 2nd leg up is a very strong buy climax. It can be hard to imagine that a strong 2-week rally could reverse down and be the start of a bear trend, but that happens fairly often.<p>However, the bears typically need at least a micro double top or an ii pattern (consecutive inside bars), before they can get a trend reversal down. If either forms next week, smart traders will be ready for a possible reversal down. More likely, traders will buy a reversal down next week.<h3 id=\"14-probably-not-strong-follow-through-next-week\">Probably not strong follow-through next week</h3><p>I mentioned above that the Emini is breaking above a 250-point tall trading range and that the bulls want a measured move up to 4,200. But I also said that the Emini will probably not quickly break far above the 4,000 Big Round Number.<p>With the strong 6-day rally and the breakout above the 3 bear bars, traders are betting against an immediate reversal down. But with the market stalling at every Big Round Number since 3,500, the Emini will probably not race far up next week either. Therefore, the Emini will probably trade sideways to up next week, and not have a dramatic move in either direction.<h2 id=\"15-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Also, there were buyers below Friday’s low. Friday is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. The bulls are trying to break above the 3,950 Big Round Number and then the even bigger 4,000 Big Round Number. Will the Emini go far above 4,000? Too early to tell. However, it should go above Friday’s high, which would trigger the buy signal.<p>I said that traders would buy the 1st reversal down after a 6-bar bull micro channel in a bull trend. If today goes above Friday’s high, but the Emini reverses down today or tomorrow, the bears will have a micro double top. If either day closes on its low, there would then be a Low 2 top, as well as a higher high double top with the February 16 high. That would be a credible sell signal. However, even a good sell signal only has a 40% chance of leading to a trend reversal. Consequently, if the bears get their micro double top, it will more likely be minor. Traders expect a test of 4,000 in March.<p>The past 2 days were small and had reversals on the 5-minute chart. This is not yet a strong breakout above the February 16 high. It increases the chance that today will be sideways again as well. However, with the Emini near a critical price (4,000), there is an increased chance of a big trend day in either direction early this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 1 point in the Globex session. If it opens around here, traders will expect today to trade above Friday’s high, which would trigger a High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. But with the Emini stalling for 2 days at the prior high, traders will look for another sideways day again today. But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the 1st hour, they will switch to swing trading for a possible trend day.<p>While it is possible for today to break above 4,000, it is unlikely to do so. This is because that is 70 points above, and the average range for the past several days is much less than that. Also, the Emini has stalled at the February high.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-15.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and weak bull channel.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-weak-Low-bear-flag-after-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-15-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weak Low  bear flag after wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart reversed down on Friday in a 3-month bear channel. However, there were 3 bull bars and there is now a wedge bottom. Friday formed a 2-bar reversal with Thursday. It is therefore another sell signal bar. But it has a big tail below. Also, it came after 3 bulls bars and a wedge bottom. Traders expect at least a couple legs sideways to up. Therefore, if today triggers the sell signal by breaking below Friday’s low, the EURUSD is more likely to enter a trading range than resume the bear trend.<p>Because the EURUSD is in a bear trend, if there is going to be a surprise, down is more likely. However, the wedge bottom has created some confusion. That typically leads to sideways trading, and at least a couple small legs up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market sold off early in the overnight session on the 5-minute chart. However, it then entered a trading range for the past 6 hours just above Friday’s low. Day traders have been scalping reversals up and down.<p>The bears will try to trigger the sell signal on the daily chart by having the EURUSD break below Friday’s low. But even if they succeed, there will probably be buyers below, and below the March 9 low. This is because traders expect a small trading range after the wedge bottom on the daily chart. They will look to buy selloffs and sell rallies this week. This is true even if the EURUSD goes in one direction for several days, like it did with last week’s the 3-day rally.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then reversed up sharply from a 2nd Leg Bear Trap to back above Friday’s high, again triggering the daily buy signal.<p>After a 20-Gap Bar pullback to the EMA, it rallied to a new all-time high at the end of the day. Today’s strong reversal up increases the chance of higher prices tomorrow. The bulls are hoping for a breakout above 4,000 this week.<p>There is always a bear case. If tomorrow reverses down strongly, which is unlikely after today’s strong rally, the bears will have a micro double top with Thursday’s high and a double top with the February 16 high.

Also, there were buyers below Friday’s low. Friday is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. The bulls are trying to break above the 3,950 Big Round Number and then the even bigger 4,000 Big Round Number. Will the Emini go far above 4,000? Too early to tell. However, it should go above Friday’s high, which would trigger the buy signal.<p>I said that traders would buy the 1st reversal down after a 6-bar bull micro channel in a bull trend. If today goes above Friday’s high, but the Emini reverses down today or tomorrow, the bears will have a micro double top. If either day closes on its low, there would then be a Low 2 top, as well as a higher high double top with the February 16 high. That would be a credible sell signal. However, even a good sell signal only has a 40% chance of leading to a trend reversal. Consequently, if the bears get their micro double top, it will more likely be minor. Traders expect a test of 4,000 in March.<p>The past 2 days were small and had reversals on the 5-minute chart. This is not yet a strong breakout above the February 16 high. It increases the chance that today will be sideways again as well. However, with the Emini near a critical price (4,000), there is an increased chance of a big trend day in either direction early this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 1 point in the Globex session. If it opens around here, traders will expect today to trade above Friday’s high, which would trigger a High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. But with the Emini stalling for 2 days at the prior high, traders will look for another sideways day again today. But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the 1st hour, they will switch to swing trading for a possible trend day.<p>While it is possible for today to break above 4,000, it is unlikely to do so. This is because that is 70 points above, and the average range for the past several days is much less than that. Also, the Emini has stalled at the February high.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-15.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and weak bull channel.

However, there were 3 bull bars and there is now a wedge bottom. Friday formed a 2-bar reversal with Thursday. It is therefore another sell signal bar. But it has a big tail below. Also, it came after 3 bulls bars and a wedge bottom. Traders expect at least a couple legs sideways to up. Therefore, if today triggers the sell signal by breaking below Friday’s low, the EURUSD is more likely to enter a trading range than resume the bear trend.<p>Because the EURUSD is in a bear trend, if there is going to be a surprise, down is more likely. However, the wedge bottom has created some confusion. That typically leads to sideways trading, and at least a couple small legs up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market sold off early in the overnight session on the 5-minute chart. However, it then entered a trading range for the past 6 hours just above Friday’s low. Day traders have been scalping reversals up and down.<p>The bears will try to trigger the sell signal on the daily chart by having the EURUSD break below Friday’s low. But even if they succeed, there will probably be buyers below, and below the March 9 low. This is because traders expect a small trading range after the wedge bottom on the daily chart. They will look to buy selloffs and sell rallies this week. This is true even if the EURUSD goes in one direction for several days, like it did with last week’s the 3-day rally.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then reversed up sharply from a 2nd Leg Bear Trap to back above Friday’s high, again triggering the daily buy signal.<p>After a 20-Gap Bar pullback to the EMA, it rallied to a new all-time high at the end of the day. Today’s strong reversal up increases the chance of higher prices tomorrow. The bulls are hoping for a breakout above 4,000 this week.<p>There is always a bear case. If tomorrow reverses down strongly, which is unlikely after today’s strong rally, the bears will have a micro double top with Thursday’s high and a double top with the February 16 high.

The bulls want the Emini to break strongly above 4,000 this week. With yesterday closing near its high yesterday, today will probably trade at least a little higher. It might even gap up, and It should test 4,000 today or tomorrow.<p>The bears hope that today sells off. That would create a micro double top with Thursday’s high and a double top with the February 16 high. However, today they would need the Emini to close on its low to attract sellers tomorrow, given how strong the 8-day rally has been. Traders expect higher prices.<p>It is important to note that there is an FOMC announcement 11 am PST tomorrow. Financial markets often get neutral and quiet ahead of the report. That slightly reduces the chance of a big trend day today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. It might gap up today. If it does, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the first hour.<p>Yesterday had a climactic rally into the close. While that is a sign of strong bulls, it typically will attract some profit taking. There is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading, that begins by the end of the 2nd hour today.<p>Also, the day after an extreme buy climax day only has a 25% chance of being another strong bull trend day. If today is a bull trend day, it will more likely be a weaker type, like a bull channel of a Trending Trading Range Day.<p>That big rally at the end of the day was a breakout. A move like that typically leads to a measured move up or down within a few days. Up is more likely. However, 20% of the time, it is a bull trap, and immediately reverses down. In this case, it was yesterday’s second leg up. If it were to reverse down on the open, the rally would be a 2nd Leg Bull Trap.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-16.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal and Emini triggered high 1 buy signal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If today’s low remains above yesterday’s low, the bears will see today as the 2nd sell signal bar in 4 days. Today would then be a Low 2 bear flag sell signal bar.<p>The bulls hope that last week’s reversal up will lead to a bull trend. They see the 3-day pullback as a bull flag. If today is a bull day, it would be a High 1 buy signal bar. They see last week’s rally as a reversal up from above the November 4 low. Also, the bear channel has had 3 bottoms since the January 1 low. It is therefore a wedge bull flag.<p>So, we have both a bull flag and a bear flag. What will happen? After a sell climax, traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. That could mean a single bull bar. If today closes above its midpoint, it will meet the minimum expectation of traders. More bears would be willing to look to sell for another leg down.<p>However, after a sell climax and a 3-month selloff, traders expect the reversal to last more than 6 bars, and retrace more of the final leg down. Consequently, it is more likely that the EURUSD will go more sideways to up for at least another week. A common target is the top of the most recent leg down. That is the March 3 sell climax high. But with the EURUSD being sideways for 4 days and with the FOMC announcement tomorrow, today will probably remain small.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up from above yesterday’s low overnight but so far has been unable to get above yesterday’s high. The reversal up was strong enough so that the EURUSD will probably hold above the overnight low. That means it should remain sideways to up for the remainder of the day.<p>There have been many reversals overnight. Day traders have been both buying and selling, but they have been scalping. Despite the reversal up, there is currently a 50% retracement. The EURUSD is now almost back down to the open of the day. Day traders will continue to scalp reversals up and down, unless there is a strong breakout in either direction. There is no sign of that at the moment.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-wedge-bear-channel-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-16-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was a trading range day, but closed below the open. It is now a sell signal bar on the daily chart. However, because it had a prominent tail below, it is a weak sell signal bar.<p>Also, the context is bad for the bears. While today is a 2nd reversal down from above the February 16 high, there is now a 9-day tight bull channel. If tomorrow reverses down, the reversal will probably be minor.

The bulls want the Emini to break strongly above 4,000 this week. With yesterday closing near its high yesterday, today will probably trade at least a little higher. It might even gap up, and It should test 4,000 today or tomorrow.<p>The bears hope that today sells off. That would create a micro double top with Thursday’s high and a double top with the February 16 high. However, today they would need the Emini to close on its low to attract sellers tomorrow, given how strong the 8-day rally has been. Traders expect higher prices.<p>It is important to note that there is an FOMC announcement 11 am PST tomorrow. Financial markets often get neutral and quiet ahead of the report. That slightly reduces the chance of a big trend day today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. It might gap up today. If it does, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the first hour.<p>Yesterday had a climactic rally into the close. While that is a sign of strong bulls, it typically will attract some profit taking. There is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading, that begins by the end of the 2nd hour today.<p>Also, the day after an extreme buy climax day only has a 25% chance of being another strong bull trend day. If today is a bull trend day, it will more likely be a weaker type, like a bull channel of a Trending Trading Range Day.<p>That big rally at the end of the day was a breakout. A move like that typically leads to a measured move up or down within a few days. Up is more likely. However, 20% of the time, it is a bull trap, and immediately reverses down. In this case, it was yesterday’s second leg up. If it were to reverse down on the open, the rally would be a 2nd Leg Bull Trap.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-16.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal and Emini triggered high 1 buy signal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-Low-2-bear-flag-and-High-1-bull-flag-after-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Low 2 bear flag and High 1 bull flag after sell climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart so far, has a bull inside day today. If today’s low remains above yesterday’s low, the bears will see today as the 2nd sell signal bar in 4 days. Today would then be a Low 2 bear flag sell signal bar.<p>The bulls hope that last week’s reversal up will lead to a bull trend. They see the 3-day pullback as a bull flag. If today is a bull day, it would be a High 1 buy signal bar. They see last week’s rally as a reversal up from above the November 4 low. Also, the bear channel has had 3 bottoms since the January 1 low. It is therefore a wedge bull flag.<p>So, we have both a bull flag and a bear flag. What will happen? After a sell climax, traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. That could mean a single bull bar. If today closes above its midpoint, it will meet the minimum expectation of traders. More bears would be willing to look to sell for another leg down.<p>However, after a sell climax and a 3-month selloff, traders expect the reversal to last more than 6 bars, and retrace more of the final leg down. Consequently, it is more likely that the EURUSD will go more sideways to up for at least another week. A common target is the top of the most recent leg down. That is the March 3 sell climax high. But with the EURUSD being sideways for 4 days and with the FOMC announcement tomorrow, today will probably remain small.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up from above yesterday’s low overnight but so far has been unable to get above yesterday’s high. The reversal up was strong enough so that the EURUSD will probably hold above the overnight low. That means it should remain sideways to up for the remainder of the day.<p>There have been many reversals overnight. Day traders have been both buying and selling, but they have been scalping. Despite the reversal up, there is currently a 50% retracement. The EURUSD is now almost back down to the open of the day. Day traders will continue to scalp reversals up and down, unless there is a strong breakout in either direction. There is no sign of that at the moment.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-wedge-bear-channel-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-16-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was a trading range day, but closed below the open. It is now a sell signal bar on the daily chart. However, because it had a prominent tail below, it is a weak sell signal bar.<p>Also, the context is bad for the bears. While today is a 2nd reversal down from above the February 16 high, there is now a 9-day tight bull channel. If tomorrow reverses down, the reversal will probably be minor. That means the Emini could trade sideways to down for a couple days. It is still likely that the Emini will test the strong magnet above at the 4,000 Big Round Number.<p>There is an FOMC announcement tomorrow at 11 am PST.

This is an Emini Low 2 top with Thursday’s high. The bears see it as a 2nd failed breakout. But the 9-day bull channel is tight, the sell signal bar is small with a prominent tail below, and the 4,000 Big Round Number is a strong magnet above. That makes only a minor reversal likely. Traders should expect maybe a couple days of sideways to down trading, and then another attempt to break above 4,000.<p>Because the Emini is so overbought on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts, there is a slightly increased chance that this could be the start of a 10% correction. However, when the bull channel has been tight and there is a magnet just above, traders expect that there will be buyers not far below today’s low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>There will be an FOMC announcement today at 11 am PST. Day traders should exit positions ahead of the report, and wait at least 10 minutes afterwards before resuming trading. This is because there is typically a brief sharp move up and down just after the report, and that makes it easy to lose money in those 1st 10 minutes. Also, an FOMC report sometimes leads to a big trend, and it can be up or down.<p>The Emini is down over 18 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap below yesterday’s low. That would trigger the Low 2 top sell signal on the daily chart. However, it the gap is small, it will probably close in the 1st hour.<p>Even though the Emini has rallied strongly for 9 days, there has been at least one swing up and one swing down every day. Day traders will expect that again today. But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the 1st hour, there will be an increased chance of a trend day. Because of the 11 am PST FOMC announcement, day traders should look at today as 2 separate days. Whatever happens after the report is not highly correlated with what happens before. They should be open to anything after the report. That includes a trend, a reversal, or a trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-wedge-bear-channel-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-17.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bear channel.

However, yesterday was a small bear bar with a big tail below. That means there was hesitation. This is so far a weak bear breakout. Also, the context was bad. While the EURUSD had been in a bear trend since January 6, it reversed up last week from a wedge bottom.<p>There were 3 consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. Traders know that usually will lead to a 2nd leg sideways to up. Consequently, many bears are not eager to sell yet, because they expect at least one more leg sideways to up. However, if there is a surprisingly big bear bar today or tomorrow, they will conclude that the bear trend is resuming and they will begin to sell again.<p>Since the March 9 sell climax was extreme, and it came in a 3-month bear trend, there is an increased chance that the short covering could last a couple weeks and reach the March 3 top of the most recent leg down. However, this 3-month selloff is coming from a clear wedge top on the weekly chart. Therefore, even if the EURUSD rallies from here, the odds still favor a continuation down to the November 4 higher low at some point in the next few months.<p>There is an FOMC announcement today at 11 am PST. It sometimes leads to a big move in either direction, and there is usually a sharp move up and down within the 1st few minutes after the announcement. Day traders should exit positions ahead of the report, and wait at least 10 minutes afterwards before trading again.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a tight trading range overnight. It has been difficult for day traders to make even 10 pips on their scalp attempts. They will continue to scalp reversals in both directions, unless there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction.<p>The bears want today to close below the open. Today would then be a 4th consecutive bear day on the daily chart. That would increase the chance that the bear trend is resuming.<p>The bulls want a 2nd leg up on the daily chart. They need to get strong bull bars to encourage traders to buy. They therefore want today to close near the high of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bull-breakout-after-FOMC.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull breakout after FOMC\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is an Emini Low 2 top with Thursday’s high. The bears see it as a 2nd failed breakout. But the 9-day bull channel is tight, the sell signal bar is small with a prominent tail below, and the 4,000 Big Round Number is a strong magnet above. That makes only a minor reversal likely. Traders should expect maybe a couple days of sideways to down trading, and then another attempt to break above 4,000.<p>Because the Emini is so overbought on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts, there is a slightly increased chance that this could be the start of a 10% correction. However, when the bull channel has been tight and there is a magnet just above, traders expect that there will be buyers not far below today’s low.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>There will be an FOMC announcement today at 11 am PST. Day traders should exit positions ahead of the report, and wait at least 10 minutes afterwards before resuming trading. This is because there is typically a brief sharp move up and down just after the report, and that makes it easy to lose money in those 1st 10 minutes. Also, an FOMC report sometimes leads to a big trend, and it can be up or down.<p>The Emini is down over 18 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap below yesterday’s low. That would trigger the Low 2 top sell signal on the daily chart. However, it the gap is small, it will probably close in the 1st hour.<p>Even though the Emini has rallied strongly for 9 days, there has been at least one swing up and one swing down every day. Day traders will expect that again today. But if there is a series of strong trend bars up or down in the 1st hour, there will be an increased chance of a trend day. Because of the 11 am PST FOMC announcement, day traders should look at today as 2 separate days. Whatever happens after the report is not highly correlated with what happens before. They should be open to anything after the report. That includes a trend, a reversal, or a trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-wedge-bear-channel-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-17.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bear channel.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EURUSD-Forex-weak-breakout-below-Low-2-bear-flag-after-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-17-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weak breakout below Low 2 bear flag after wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart triggered a Low 2 bear flag sell signal yesterday when it traded below Monday’s low. However, yesterday was a small bear bar with a big tail below. That means there was hesitation. This is so far a weak bear breakout. Also, the context was bad. While the EURUSD had been in a bear trend since January 6, it reversed up last week from a wedge bottom.<p>There were 3 consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. Traders know that usually will lead to a 2nd leg sideways to up. Consequently, many bears are not eager to sell yet, because they expect at least one more leg sideways to up. However, if there is a surprisingly big bear bar today or tomorrow, they will conclude that the bear trend is resuming and they will begin to sell again.<p>Since the March 9 sell climax was extreme, and it came in a 3-month bear trend, there is an increased chance that the short covering could last a couple weeks and reach the March 3 top of the most recent leg down. However, this 3-month selloff is coming from a clear wedge top on the weekly chart. Therefore, even if the EURUSD rallies from here, the odds still favor a continuation down to the November 4 higher low at some point in the next few months.<p>There is an FOMC announcement today at 11 am PST. It sometimes leads to a big move in either direction, and there is usually a sharp move up and down within the 1st few minutes after the announcement. Day traders should exit positions ahead of the report, and wait at least 10 minutes afterwards before trading again.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5-minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a tight trading range overnight. It has been difficult for day traders to make even 10 pips on their scalp attempts. They will continue to scalp reversals in both directions, unless there is a series of strong trend bars in either direction.<p>The bears want today to close below the open. Today would then be a 4th consecutive bear day on the daily chart. That would increase the chance that the bear trend is resuming.<p>The bulls want a 2nd leg up on the daily chart. They need to get strong bull bars to encourage traders to buy. They therefore want today to close near the high of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bull-breakout-after-FOMC.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull breakout after FOMC\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, consecutive strong bear trend days have been uncommon since October.<li>The tail at the bottom of yesterday means the bears are hesitant.<li>Yesterday’s range was not very big, and therefore yesterday was not strongly bearish.<li>Yesterday is sell signal bar for higher high major trend reversal.<li>2-week tight bull channel makes minor reversal down more likely.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important in the final hour.<li>The bears want week to close below the open, so this week will be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<li>Every day for 2 weeks has had at least one swing up and one swing down, so traders will expect that again today.<li>If series of strong trend bars up or down in 1st hour, today could trend all day.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>The Emini is down 2 points in the Globex market, and it has been sideways overnight.

Consecutive big bear days have been rare since late October. If today is a bear day, it will probably not be a big bear day.<li>Today is Friday and there is often a trend in the final hour of the end of the week, toward weekly support or resistance.<li>The bulls want the week to close above, or at least near the open, which is the most important magnet this week.<li>The bears want the week to close near the low so that this week will be a credible sell signal bar on the weekly chart.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bear-breakout-below-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-19.png\" alt=\"Emini bear breakout below trading range.

The Emini traded below Monday’s low and 3,900 Big Round Number, but closed above both, and therefore was not as bearish as it could have been. Emini in trading range.<li>Yesterday closed at open of week, so this week so far is neutral (doji inside bar on weekly chart).<li>Bears hope selloff from all-time high is early Small Pullback Bear Trend, but need consecutive big bear days closing near their lows to put odds in their favor.<li>The bulls see past 5 days as pullback from last week’s all-time high. Need good buy signal bar for resumption up to 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>Middle of 2-week trading range. Slightly more likely to make a new high before end of month, because of end of quarter window dressing and strong early March rally.<li>Most days for several weeks have had at least one swing up and one swing down.

That would trigger the weekly sell signal. Bears want this week to be a big bear bar closing near its low.<li>Bulls will try to prevent today from being a big bear day closing on its low.

The buying could continue all week.<li>Despite Friday’s strong rally into the close, the Emini will probably not gap up to a new high on both the daily and weekly charts today.<li>If Wednesday closes near the high of the month, April could gap up to a new high Thursday on the monthly chart.<li>Since Wednesday is also the end of the month, monthly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The 4,000 Big Round Number is a magnet above, and the February high is a magnet below.<li>A reversal can come at any time, but with Thursday and Friday being so exceptionally strong, the odds of a big bear trend are less today. Today will probably be sideways to up. If it is down, it will likely not be a big bear day.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Down 20 points in Globex session after Friday being big bull trend day. Big bull days on March 15, 17, and 22 all had bad follow-through on the next day. Therefore, increased chance of sideways to down today.<li>Bulls unable to create big gap up today on daily and weekly charts. They are therefore not as strong as they appeared at the close of Friday. Reduced chance of big bull day today.<li>Big Up Friday and Big Gap Down today creates Big Confusion. Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range, so increased chance of trading range for 1<sup>st</sup>2 hours today.<li>If today is going to be bear trend, will probably have to enter trading range for a couple hours first. Strong bull trend, like Friday, usually has to transition into trading range, before becoming bear trend day.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Expanding-triangle-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-29.png\" alt=\"Expanding triangle with late bull breakout with 1st quarter window dressing.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<li>However, it had only a small bull body, making it a fairly neutral day (doji day). It is a lower probability buy setup.<li>It was an inside day after a rally, and therefore a sell signal bar, as well a possible bull trap. The bears want a reversal down from a double top with the March 17 high. However, yesterday was the 4<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull day, and it is therefore a weak sell setup.<li>The bears want a reversal down. There would then be a double top with the high from 2 weeks ago. But after 4 bull bars, a reversal down would probably not last more than a couple days.<li>Today is the final day of March and of the 1<sup>st</sup>quarter. The bulls want today to close near its high and a strong finish to 1<sup>st</sup>quarter.<li>That would increase the chance of a gap up tomorrow, which would create a gap up on the monthly chart.<li>If there is a gap up on the monthly chart tomorrow, the gap will be small on the monthly chart. Small gaps usually close before the bar closes. Therefore, the gap should close in April.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Up 5 points in Globex session.<li>With today at end of month, and near new high, increased chance today will close near all-time high. Bulls want gap up on monthly chart tomorrow, which would increase chance of higher prices and breakout above 4,000 in April.<li>Yesterday ended with big bull bar, and higher low double bottom. Bulls are hoping today will break above yesterday’s trading range, and rally for a measured move up to all-time high.<li>Bears want break below yesterday’s trading range, and a measured move down. After 4 bull days, probably buyers not far below yesterday’s low, so would probably lead to only 1- to 2-day pullback.<li>Last day of month and of quarter, so increased chance of trend day, and increased chance of big move up or down in final hour.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Emini-bear-trap-and-bull-trap-in-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-3-31.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trap and bull trap in trading range day.

Without strong bear bars, the bulls will continue to buy every 1- to 3-day pullback, despite the buy climaxes on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
