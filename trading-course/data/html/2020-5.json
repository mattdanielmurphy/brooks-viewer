There is a wedge buy climax on the 60 minute chart. It is nested within a bigger wedge buy climax on the daily chart. The weekly chart is in a 6 week micro channel, which is a buy climax. Traders should expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to below 2700 to begin within 2 weeks. It might have begun this week.<p>However, April is a bull inside bar in a 12 year bull trend. It is a reasonable buy signal bar in a decent buy setup. The Emini might have to go above the April high to see what’s there.<p>That would be a break above the current wedge top on the daily chart. If the bears then get a 2nd reversal down, they would have a better chance of it leading to a couple legs down.<h3>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important</h3><p>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important. Last weekend, I said that this week would probably trade above the 20 week EMA, but it might reverse down in the 2nd half of the week. I said that last week had a big tail below and that increased the chance of this week having a big tail above.<p>The week’s range so far has been small and so has the reversal down. If the bears can get the week to close near its low, that will increase the chance of a pullback over the next few weeks.<p>The bulls would like the week to close near its high. That would increase the chance of triggering the monthly buy signal. But because of the buy climaxes and the monthly chart in a 2 1/2 year trading range, the upside from here over the next few weeks is probably small.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 60 points in the Globex session. But the selling was not strong and the Emini has been sideways for 6 hours.<p>Today will probably gap below yesterday’s low. That usually results in a trading range open. This is even more likely with a 6 hour trading range ni the Globex session.<p>The most important prices today on the weekly chart today are last week’s high and this week’s open. If the bears can get today to close below both, they will have an increased chance of lower prices over the next couple weeks. The bulls know that and will try to get today to close near its high.<p>Even if a 2 – 3 week correction is underway, it will be a pullback in a strong bull trend. Pullbacks in strong trends often lack clarity. There usually is not the conviction and relentless selling that you see in a bear trend. For example, look at February and March.<p>More often, the Emini just works lower. Attempts to resume up have bad follow through and form minor lower highs. The selloff frequently looks like a bull flag that just keeps adding bars and drifting lower.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emini-wedge-rally-to-higher-high-double-top-at-EMA-in-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-1.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge rally to higher high double top at EMA in trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-higher-low-major-trend-reversal-and-high-2-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-1-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex higher low major trend reversal and high 2 bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is reversing up from a higher low major trend reversal. The April selloff was a High 2 bull flag. Traders see the 2 week rally as a resumption of the March 27 bull trend reversal.<p>While this is true, it is important to remember that the chart has been in a trading range for 8 months. There have been many strong 2 – 4 week moves up and down. Several were much stronger than this one. Yet, each reversed within 2 – 4 weeks. Traders expect the same this time. But what they do not know is where the reversal will begin.<p>When there is a reversal, it will come at a resistance level. The most obvious ones are prior lower highs.<p>For example, the bears would like this rally to end around where the EURUSD is now. That would be a double top with the April 15 high. But since that would be from the lower half of the 8 month range, that is less likely.<p>Furthermore, the March 27 rally was surprisingly strong. In addition, the bulls who bought the close of that strong day never had a chance to get out. That close and high therefore are untested.<p>Typically a bull trap like that eventually gets tested. This reversal up, while not very strong, is good enough for traders to believe that it will continue up to the March 27 high within a couple weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a small overnight rally. It broke above yesterday’s high.<p>However, the EURUSD has been sideways in a 20 pip range for 3 hours just below the April 15 lower high. This is a lack of conviction. This protracted hesitation just below significant resistance reduces the chance of a strong breakout above the resistance or reversal down from the resistance today.<p>Traders know that big moves often come at resistance and therefore there is an increased chance of a trend from here. At the moment, day traders are looking for 10 pip scalps, waiting for a strong breakout up or down. It will probably not come today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bear-trending-trading-range-day-in-Emini.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-1-2.png\" alt=\"Bear trending trading range day in Emini\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It formed a lower trading range. Today was therefore a bear Trending Trading Range Day.<p>This week is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. There is also a nested wedge top on the daily chart. This is probably the start of a 2 – 3 week pullback. If so, the bulls will probably buy again around 2600. Traders expect a higher low and at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>If this is a reversal down, it will probably be minor. Therefore, it will likely have bounces along the way.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This week is a good candidate for the start of a 2 – 3 week pullback.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market has been sideways for 8 weeks after an extreme buy climax. It will probably be in a trading range for the remainder of the year.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has also been sideways for 8 weeks. It is in Breakout Mode. This past week’s bull bar slightly increases the chance of higher prices next week.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Consecutive small inside bars after extreme buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-consecutive-inside-bars-after-buy-climax-at-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-2.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart has consecutive inside bars after buy climax at top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures market formed a small bull doji bar in April on the monthly chart. Its high was far below the March high and its low was far above the March low. April was therefore a small inside bar.<p>With only 1 day so far in May, the May candlestick is within April’s range. At the moment, there are now consecutive inside bars. This is an ii (inside-inside) pattern. This tight range is a reflection of the bond futures being in an 8 week tight trading range on the weekly chart and a triangle on the daily chart (not shown).<p>Also, March was a huge bar but it closed almost exactly in its middle. The big tail on its top means that traders sold strongly into the end of the month. That close in the middle is a sign that the strong bull trend is now of neutral, at least for the moment.<p>Traders know that the 3 month rally was the most extreme in the history of the bond market. Many bulls used the big March rally to take surprisingly be profits.<h3>Does the buy climax mean that the bull trend has ended?</h3><p>The selloff from the March high was big enough to make traders wonder if the bull trend has finally ended. They need more information.<p>But with exhausted bulls and scared bears, the bond market will probably have to go sideways for many bars before it begins to trend again. Traders believe that the past 2 months are the start of a trading range that will last all year.<h3>Buy signal bar, but a buy climax is weak context</h3><p>April was a bull inside bar in a bull trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>But there was extreme profit-taking in the end of March. Traders know that the bulls are exhausted. They will not want to buy aggressively again until after they see how strong the bears can be.<p>The bulls typically want to see at least a couple legs down. If the legs down are strong, the bulls will wait for the market to go sideways for several bars before buying again.<p>However, if the 2 legs are more sideways than down, the bulls will doubt the resolve of the bears. That will make the bulls more willing to buy again.<h3>How long before traders decide on direction?</h3><p>This process of deciding how strong the bears are typically takes about 10 bars to complete. Since this is a monthly chart, the bond futures will probably be sideways for the rest of the year.<p>Now what about the April buy signal bar? Since it is coming immediately after strong profit-taking, there will not be sustained buying above its highs. Traders expect a 2nd leg down. Consequently, the bulls will take quick profits and the bears will sell above the April buy signal bar’s high.<p>As an inside bar after a buy climax, April is also a sell signal bar. But it has a bull body and a small range. It is also the 4th consecutive bull bar on the monthly chart. Traders see that as a weak sell signal. Therefore they expect buyers not too far below.<p>With buyers below and sellers above, the odds favor more sideways trading. As I said, the bond futures will probably be sideways for the remainder of the year.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Weak High 2 bull flag in 8 month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-High-2-bull-flag-but-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-2-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has High 2 bull flag but in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart has had many dramatic reversal since February. It has been in a bear channel for 2 years and in a trading range for 8 months.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. The is a 50% chance of a bull breakout and a 50% chance of a bear breakout. Additionally, there is a 50% chance that any breakout will fail.<p>The EURUSD is in the lower half of both the bear channel and the trading range on the weekly chart. Also, the most recent strong move was the rally from the March 23 low. These factors slightly increase the probability that the next move will be up. However, until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Traders see the weekly chart as neutral.<p>By going above last week’s high, the EURUSD triggered a High 2 buy signal. But the buy signal bar last week was a bear bar. Also, there were 2 consecutive bear bars. That is a weak buy setup. However, this week closed near its high. That slightly increases the chance of higher prices next week.<h2>ioi Breakout Mode pattern on the monthly chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-an-ioi-breakout-mode-chart-pattern.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-2-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has an ioi breakout mode chart pattern\"></a></figure><p>On the monthly chart, the April low’s was above the March low. Also, the April high was below the March high. April was therefore an inside bar. That is a one bar Breakout Mode pattern. In addition, March was huge and it was an outside bar. There is now an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern on the monthly chart.<p>After one day, May is currently inside of April. That means consecutive inside bars (ii), which is another Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Since the past 3 months were all dojis, the pattern is more neutral. That reduces the chance of a strong breakout into a trend.<p>Furthermore, the monthly chart has been sideways for 8 months. Markets have inertia. They tend to continue to do what they have been doing. Therefore, traders expect more sideways trading.<p>So what happens if May breaks above or below April’s range? Most likely, not much. Trading ranges resist breaking out. Consequently, a move out of April’s range will have a hard time lasting more than a month or so. The EURUSD will probably continue sideways indefinitely.<p>Everyone knows that there will eventually be a breakout into a trend. But until there are consecutive big trend bars, traders will continue to look for reversals.<h2>The coronavirus pandemic</h2><p>Thirty million Americans have lost their jobs. The majority of the country has significantly curtailed its spending. Consequently, what happens with the pandemic is hugely important to the economy.<p>The euphoria over the past month is ending. In part, it was due to traders concluding that this is not going to be like the plague. But they will soon conclude that it also will not be as simple as the flu. The result is the the market has to remain repriced.<p>What happens with the pandemic and our response will determine what the new price is. Traders believe it is somewhere below the February high and above the March low.<h3>Aggressive pursuit of a vaccine</h3><p>Europe and Asia are paying the WHO to develop a couple dozen vaccines. They expect that at least one will prove to be safe and effective once the studies are complete. They might start to mass produce many of the vaccines before the studies are done so that if one is found to be safe and effective, they will have millions of doses ready immediately.<p>This is a smart approach, but they must make sure that whichever they choose as the best option is safe. You cannot vaccinate millions of people and then discover that 10% die 2 months later.<p>The United States has decided to not participate with the WHO. Instead, we are doing the same thing ourselves, but with far few vaccines. This is risky because if none of ours works, we will have lost many months and countless lives as we then try to catch up with the WHO, Europe, and Asia.<p>The idea of making millions of doses of several vaccines before the studies are complete is great. Doing it on our own and not combining resources with Europe, Asia, and the WHO is a political decision. It does not make scientific sense and it is not in the best interest of the American people.<h3>Our inability to see how important testing is</h3><p>I have talked a lot about our lack of adequate testing. It does not make sense that we have not been far more aggressive in manufacturing test kits and in conducting widespread tests. This is the reason why we had to shut down the economy and the reason why we have had to shut down for so long.<p>I don’t understand it. We’ve had months to fix this. Why aren’t Fauci and Birx screaming about this? In WWII, we quickly made all that we needed. Why are we choosing not to make 10 times or 100 times more test kits? We don’t even have enough tests for the 100 senators returning to Washington next week. Incredible.<p>Adequate testing will open up the economy sooner. That will save hundreds of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives. How much would it cost to make a few billion test kits? Nothing compared to what we are losing.<h3>The importance of exponential growth</h3><p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/market-analysis/emini-has-30-chance-30-correction-coronavirus-pandemic/#coronavirus-pandemic\" target=\"_blank\">I talked about exponential growth in February.</a>There are basically 3 ways for an infected person to infect someone else.<p>You obviously want to avoid someone who is coughing and looking very sick. If they are sick with Covid-19, they can easily spread the disease.<p>But there are 2 additional problems with Covid-19 that increase its spread. First, most infected people are not very sick. Many do not realize they are sick at all. Yet, they can be contagious. Next, many who end up becoming clearly sick can begin infecting others 3 days before developing symptoms.<p>The average infected person, whether or not he gets diagnosed or ever discovers that he was infected, infects 3 other people. Let’s assume that a person who gets infected is contagious for 2 weeks. If you start with 1 person, in 2 weeks, he is recovered, but there are now 3 new infected, contagious people. Two weeks later, there are 9.<p>If you graph the number of cases over time, the line curves up and to the right. When the number of infected people accelerates like that in a parabolic curve, it is called exponential growth.<h3>How to stop exponential growth</h3><p>The obvious goal in a pandemic is to eliminate the disease entirely. For example, when Europeans brought smallpox (another virus) to the North America, as many as 90% of the indigenous population (Native Mexicans and Native Americans) died. Ninety percent. Think about that. Yet, the vaccine today is so effective that smallpox virtually no longer exists.<p>For Covid-19, one of the major goals of disease control is to stop the exponential growth. The 1st objective is to get down to below geometric growth. In geometric growth, one person infects one other person. In 2 weeks, the 1st person is no longer contagious, but the 2nd person is. This results in the number of contagious people staying the same.<p>What happens if the average infected person has only a 50% chance of infecting someone else? If there are 4 contagious people today, there will be only 2 in 2 weeks, and only 1 a couple weeks later. This is the main goal in all pandemics. Get the spread rate to less than one so that the number of cases eventually gets to zero.<h3>How to reduce the number of cases</h3><p>One of the main tools to accomplish this is widespread testing. You want to find as many contagious people as possible and then keep them away from everyone else. Taiwan, South Korea, Germany, Austria and many other countries have done a much better job than the US. Our failed approach has resulted in our problem being comparable to that in developing countries.<h3>Why is South Korea 50 times better off than the USA?</h3><p>South Korea is an interesting example because their 1st known case was on January 21. That is the same day that the US had its 1st known case. They have had about 250 deaths in a population of 50 million.<p>The population of the US is about 6 times greater. Yet, the US has had 60,000 deaths. Our death rate is 240 times higher!<p>Why? Because South Korea quickly saw how serious the disease was and instantly began aggressive testing. They listened to their medical experts and decided to rely completely on science.<p>On the other hand, the US ignored the medical experts and chose to prioritize politics in an election year. We spent almost 2 months allowing the coronavirus to spread exponentially until the American public demanded a better response.<p>I did not hear leaders from either party forcefully arguing that we were horribly mishandling this crisis. As a physician, I was telling everyone throughout February that our approach was going to lead to a disaster. I’m certain that most other doctors felt the same way. But we are not the people making the decisions.<p>Fortunately, many governors began to do what the federal government should have done. While that has slowed the progress of the disease, it is still spreading exponentially.<h3>Freedom has consequences</h3><p>Not many of us want to live in China because we like freedom. But a strong centralized government can be good in a pandemic. China was slow to react, but once they did, they quickly got the spread under control. South Korea effectively used a strong federal response and it also saved thousands of lives.<p>We are the most free people in the world. One of our freedoms is a right to ignore science and do dumb things. States are free to eliminate social distancing guidelines. There are no serious consequences for individuals who ignore the guidelines, and many are making that choice. The result is the disease will continue to spread exponentially for a long time. This will continue for many months after a vaccine, and that means late into 2021.<p>Coronavirus will not stay confined to those states with loose guidelines because people travel freely. This will cause tens of thousands of more deaths than what would have happened if the country maintained strict social distancing and had an aggressive national testing policy.<p>Therefore, even people and states who strongly want tight guidelines will have a far greater death rate than they otherwise would have had. Even if their view is held by the majority of the country, they do not have the freedom to chose a death rate comparable to that in South Korea.<h3>Wars are not fought at the state level</h3><p>Everyone agrees this is a war. With any other war, would we choose to have 50 governors (basically, lieutenants) each deciding how to fight its share of the war? Of course not. We would fight it a general in command. Would we ignore the military experts? No.<p>But this is a different kind of war and there are strong feelings about our culture, economy, and destiny. Many people do not want the federal government telling them what to do. Also, many believe that a 1% death rate is better than having ongoing damage to the economy and major changes to our lifestyle.<h3>Looks like we are choosing herd immunity</h3><p>Even if only 30% of the country chooses the economy over a hundreds of thousands of deaths, they will win. That is the herd immunity strategy. If 70% of the country gets infected, the average infected person will be more likely than not to not infect anyone. That will eventually lead to the pandemic ending.<p>Sounds like a good strategy, right? It is if you are not old, poor, or a minority. The death rate for the country will be about 1%, but it will be 5 – 10% among some groups.<p>Also, even if only 1% dies, if 70% get infected, that is 200 million infected people. Then 1% is about 2 million deaths.<p>Obviously no one wants 2 million people to die, but that is the chance that the herd immunity crowd is willing to take. And they have veto power over the rest of us. For social distancing to work, you cannot have 30 – 40% not participating. Those people get to choose herd immunity for everyone, not just themselves. Tyranny of the minority.<p>There will be a vaccine before 70% gets infected. But probably not before 10 – 50% of the country will get infected.<p>Remember, last week I said I do not see how fewer than 500,000 Americans will die. This herd immunity choice is the reason. There are enough who believe this way so that our result will remain comparable to that of developing nations. In fact, we are already shocking behind many developing countries in terms of the percentage of our population dying from Covid-19.<h3>We can choose to be great, or not</h3><p>We are free to choose to not be a great example for the rest of the world. And that is the path we have selected. This will this result in needless deaths. Furthermore, it will create far greater damage to the economy compared to what would have happened had we made decisions based on science instead of emotion and politics.<p>The percent of our population that will die will continue to be far greater than in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and many other countries that are acting aggressively at the national level based on science. It’s our choice to give our citizens the same chance of survival as people living in El Salvador, Ghana, and Bangladesh.<p>Again, both political parties in Washington have failed to provide leadership in a national crisis. Fighting a war with 50 lieutenants in charge instead of a few generals is deadly. One party is stupid. The other is stupider.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>High 1 Bull Flag buy signal, but in 2 1/2 year trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP-500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-inside-bar-and-High-1-bull-flag-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-2-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P 500 futures monthly candlestick chart has inside bar and High 1 bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;formed a big bull bar in April. Its high is below the March high and its low is above the March low. April therefore was an inside candlestick. It got back to the February close and therefore erased the March collapse. Furthermore, the 2 1/2 year trading range is within a 12 year bull trend. These factors make April a credible High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>Traders expect May to go above the April high and trigger the monthly buy signal. But a buy signal in the middle of a trading range after a huge selloff is minor. It will probably not lead to a new all-time high<p>It is important to note that as strong as April was for the bulls, February and March were even stronger for the bears. Big Down, Big Up creates Big Confusion. Confusion and disappointment are hallmarks of a trading range.<p>The big bull bar was disappointing for the bears. If May goes above the April high, it will trigger the monthly buy signal. But because February and March were surprisingly strong, a rally from here will probably fail to get above the February high. That would disappoint the bulls. Consequently, the 2 1/2 year trading range should continue. Traders expect it to last all year.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Failed breakout above 20 week EMA</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP-500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-sell-signal-bar-at-20-week-EMA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-2-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P 500 futures weekly candlestick chart has sell signal bar at 20 week EMA\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart finally reached the 20 week EMA. I wrote about this last weekend. I said that the EMA was important resistance. Since the rally was strong and the Emini was near the EMA, the Emini was likely to get above the EMA this week.<p>However, I also wrote about last week being a doji bar in a buy climax. There are now 6 weeks where every low is above the low of the prior week. That is extreme, especially after a huge selloff. It is therefore a buy climax.<p>Also, last week was an inside bar in a 5 week bull micro channel. It was a buy signal bar in a strong bull trend. Traders expected this week to go above last week’s high and trigger the buy signal.<p>And it did. But when there is a doji buy signal late in a buy climax, the breakout typically fails within a week or two. I said that a doji buy signal bar with a big tail below often leads to a doji entry bar with a big tail above. While this past week was not big, there was a prominent tail on top. This is consistent with what I said.<p>Additionally, I said that the doji buy signal bar in a buy climax is often a 1 bar Final Bull Flag. That means there is an increased chance that the breakout above will fail.<h3>Failed breakout above High 1 buy signal bar</h3><p>Is this week a failed breakout above a buy signal bar? It might be, but while it has a bear body, it is not a big bear bar closing on its low. This week is therefore not a strong sell signal bar. It is at the resistance of the 20 week EMA, which is good for the bears.<p>However, a reversal down from a 6 week bull micro channel is typically minor. It might last a few weeks, but the bulls will expect a higher low. They will look to buy at around a 50% retracement of the 6 week rally. If this is the start of a swing down, traders should look for a higher low to form at around 2600 within a few weeks.<p>Remember, the Emini is in a 2 1/2 year trading range. Traders therefore expect reversals, even when legs up or down are strong.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Nested wedge top in strong bull trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP-500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-nested-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-2-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P 500 futures daily candlestick chart has nested wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied strongly for 6 weeks. There are now 3 clear legs up. That is a wedge rally and that typically attracts profit takers.<p>Also, if you look closely at the 3rd leg up, it subdivided into 3 legs. On the 60 minute chart, you can see that these legs formed a wedge bull channel.<p>There is therefore a 60 minute wedge nested within a wedge on the daily chart. Nested patterns have a higher probability of working. Consequently, this week’s reversal down is probably the start of a 2 – 3 week sideways to down correction.<p>The 6 week rally is in a tight bull channel. Even though the bull channel is a wedge, a tight bull channel is a strong bull trend. The 1st reversal down from a strong bull trend is usually minor. Therefore, even if there is a selloff that retraces half of the rally, the bulls will buy it. They will expect at least a 2nd leg sideways to up. The 2nd rally usually tests the top of the 1st rally.<h3>Wedge top in strong bull trend often needs 2nd reversal down</h3><p>There is one more important point about wedge tops. When there is a wedge top in a strong bull trend, in general, there is a 50% chance that there will be one more brief new high before a successful reversal down begins. Thursday’s and Friday’s selloff have reduced that to 40%.<p>Remember, April is a buy signal bar on the monthly chart. May still might have to go above the April high. That would result in one more new high in the wedge on the daily chart. But if there is a break above the April high, traders will watch for a 2nd sell signal. A 2nd signal has a higher probability of leading to a 2 – 3 week pullback.<h3>Trading range for remainder of 2020</h3><p>If the reversal down has begun or if it stars within a few weeks, can it continue down to below the March low? There is only a 30% chance of that. The Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years. It will probably continue in the range for the rest of the year.<p>When there is a reversal down in a trading range, the selloff typically falls below important support. The 2nd leg up in the wedge rally broke above the March 31 high. That was the top of the 1st leg. The April 21 higher low did not overlap that high. There is therefore a gap above the March 31 high.<p>Gaps are common in strong trends. Since this rally is in a trading range, the gap should close. That means that traders should expect the Emini to fall to around 2600.<h3>Wedge reversals often fall to the start of the wedge</h3><p>When there is a reversal from a wedge top, the selloff often reaches the start of the wedge bull channel. That is the bottom of the 1st pullback. Here, that is the April 1 low of 2434.25.<p>If the Emini gets there, it might take a couple months to reach it. Because that is very far below, the current leg down will probably not get there. There will probably be a higher low and another leg up in the 2 1/2 year trading range first. But since the chart is in a trading range, the Emini will probably get there at some point this year.<h3>It’s a trading range, so trade it like a trading range</h3><p>For the next couple months, the Emini will probably stay within the 2600 – 2900 range. That trading range is within the 2 1/2 year range from 2200 to 3400.<p>One of the difficulties in trading ranges is that everything is less clear. Good tops and bottoms fail and the legs up and down often go farther than what looks reasonable.<p>Also, the legs up look most bullish just before reversing down and the legs down look most bearish just before reversing up. It is important to avoid the temptation of buying high or selling low, hoping for a new trend.<p>In addition, trade the chart that is in front of you and not the one you hope it becomes. Do not be upset by the reversals. They can be good opportunities for traders, but are miserable for traders hoping for sustained trends.<p>The 6 week reversal up was so strong that the March low will probably remain the low for the year. But the reversal down in February was also very strong. Any rally this year should form a lower high.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This is probably the start of a 2 – 3 week pullback to around 2600. Since the 6 week bull trend has been strong, the selloff will likely be weak. That means traders should expect bounces along the way.<p>On the weekly chart, last week was a reversal bar. The Emini went above the 20 week EMA and reversed down, as I said it was likely to do. Last week is therefore a sell signal bar for this week.<p>Since it reversed down from the EMA and the weekly chart was in a buy climax, this week will probably fall below last week’s low. Since The Emini is down 80 points in the Globex session, it will probably gap below last week’s low. That would trigger the sell signal. But after 6 weeks without a pullback, traders will look to buy a 2 – 3 week pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 30 points, which would trigger the weekly sell signal. Traders believe that a 2 – 3 week pullback is underway.<p>They are probably correct, but the selloff is a pullback in a 6 week bull trend. It is therefore unlikely to go down very fast. Day traders expect some strong bull trend days along the way.<p>When there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the EMA on the 5 minute chart. Day traders do not want to sell too far below the average price. That limits the number of sellers on the open. The big gap down limits the number of buyers.<p>This results in confusion. Day traders expect that a double top or bottom or a wedge top or bottom will be necessary before there is clarity. There is only a 20% chance of a relentless trend day from the open.<p>The first few bars will tell traders if today will have a trading range open. If there is one, they will expect a 2 – 3 hour trend to follow. But, because a trading range open represents balance, a trend coming from it usually does not continue for the rest of the day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bear-trending-trading-range-day-in-Emini.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-4.png\" alt=\"Bear trending trading range day in Emini\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-after-wedge-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-4-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top after wedge bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart had a strong enough rally last week for traders to expect at least a small 2nd leg up. Consequently, even though there is a double top with the April 15 high, the bears will probably need a micro double top.<p>They want a reversal down to below the April 24 low. That is the neck line of the double top. Then, they want a measured move down to below the March 23 low. Ultimately, they would like the 2 year bear trend to get below par (1.0).<p>But the EURUSD daily chart has been in a trading range for a month. Furthermore, that trading range is nested within a 9 month trading range. Markets resist change. Traders will assume that every strong breakout attempt will fail, like all of the others for 2 years. That means traders look for reversals every few weeks.<p>While last week’s rally was not particularly strong, it is strong enough for traders to expect buyers below yesterday’s low. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get a leg down.<p>And even then, the April 27 rally was strong enough for traders to expect a test of its high. Therefore, despite the month-long trading range, the EURUSD daily chart will probably work higher over the next couple weeks. This is true even if it sells of for 2 – 3 days.<p>But if the bears get consecutive closes below the April 24 low, traders will expect a break below the March 23 bottom of the 9 month range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market trended down overnight. By going below Friday’s low, it triggered the double top sell signal on the daily chart.<p>But Friday had a bull body. That is a weak sell signal bar. In addition, it was the 3rd consecutive bull days. That is weak context for a reversal down. Therefore, traders expect limited downside today.<p>While today triggered a sell signal on the daily chart, it then went sideways instead of down. Today so far is a weak entry bar for the bears in a weak sell setup. The bulls want today or tomorrow to close near its high. That would create a buy signal bar for a test up to the March 27 high.<p>The range has been only 20 pips for 6 hours. Day traders are scalping for 10 pips. While they would prefer a strong breakout up or down so that they could swing trade, they will continue to scalp until there is a clear breakout.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-sell-climax-then-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-4-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, it entered a tight trading range, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. There was trend resumption late in the day.<p>On the daily chart, the Emini has had minor reversals every few days for a month. Traders therefore expect a 1 – 2 day bounce starting tomorrow. Today is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. But, the rally will probably form a lower high and the Emini will likely continue down to around 2600.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That means traders should expect bounces along the way.<p>On the weekly chart, last week was a reversal bar. The Emini went above the 20 week EMA and reversed down, as I said it was likely to do. Last week is therefore a sell signal bar for this week.<p>Since it reversed down from the EMA and the weekly chart was in a buy climax, this week will probably fall below last week’s low. Since The Emini is down 80 points in the Globex session, it will probably gap below last week’s low. That would trigger the sell signal. But after 6 weeks without a pullback, traders will look to buy a 2 – 3 week pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 30 points, which would trigger the weekly sell signal. Traders believe that a 2 – 3 week pullback is underway.<p>They are probably correct, but the selloff is a pullback in a 6 week bull trend. It is therefore unlikely to go down very fast. Day traders expect some strong bull trend days along the way.<p>When there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the EMA on the 5 minute chart. Day traders do not want to sell too far below the average price. That limits the number of sellers on the open. The big gap down limits the number of buyers.<p>This results in confusion. Day traders expect that a double top or bottom or a wedge top or bottom will be necessary before there is clarity. There is only a 20% chance of a relentless trend day from the open.<p>The first few bars will tell traders if today will have a trading range open. If there is one, they will expect a 2 – 3 hour trend to follow. But, because a trading range open represents balance, a trend coming from it usually does not continue for the rest of the day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bear-trending-trading-range-day-in-Emini.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-4.png\" alt=\"Bear trending trading range day in Emini\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-after-wedge-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-4-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top after wedge bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart had a strong enough rally last week for traders to expect at least a small 2nd leg up. Consequently, even though there is a double top with the April 15 high, the bears will probably need a micro double top.<p>They want a reversal down to below the April 24 low. That is the neck line of the double top. Then, they want a measured move down to below the March 23 low. Ultimately, they would like the 2 year bear trend to get below par (1.0).<p>But the EURUSD daily chart has been in a trading range for a month. Furthermore, that trading range is nested within a 9 month trading range. Markets resist change. Traders will assume that every strong breakout attempt will fail, like all of the others for 2 years. That means traders look for reversals every few weeks.<p>While last week’s rally was not particularly strong, it is strong enough for traders to expect buyers below yesterday’s low. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get a leg down.<p>And even then, the April 27 rally was strong enough for traders to expect a test of its high. Therefore, despite the month-long trading range, the EURUSD daily chart will probably work higher over the next couple weeks. This is true even if it sells of for 2 – 3 days.<p>But if the bears get consecutive closes below the April 24 low, traders will expect a break below the March 23 bottom of the 9 month range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market trended down overnight. By going below Friday’s low, it triggered the double top sell signal on the daily chart.<p>But Friday had a bull body. That is a weak sell signal bar. In addition, it was the 3rd consecutive bull days. That is weak context for a reversal down. Therefore, traders expect limited downside today.<p>While today triggered a sell signal on the daily chart, it then went sideways instead of down. Today so far is a weak entry bar for the bears in a weak sell setup. The bulls want today or tomorrow to close near its high. That would create a buy signal bar for a test up to the March 27 high.<p>The range has been only 20 pips for 6 hours. Day traders are scalping for 10 pips. While they would prefer a strong breakout up or down so that they could swing trade, they will continue to scalp until there is a clear breakout.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-sell-climax-then-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-4-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, it entered a tight trading range, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. There was trend resumption late in the day.<p>On the daily chart, the Emini has had minor reversals every few days for a month. Traders therefore expect a 1 – 2 day bounce starting tomorrow. Today is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. But, the rally will probably form a lower high and the Emini will likely continue down to around 2600.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That triggered a minor sell signal on the weekly chart. But since there is a 6 bar bull micro channel, the reversal down should be minor.<p>The Emini has probably begun a 2 – 3 week sideways to down pullback to 2600. However, there have been reversals every 2 – 3 days for a month. Therefore, traders should expect bounces on the way down.<p>Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar for today. Also, there is a parabolic wedge bear channel on the 60 minute chart. That will probably lead to a day or two of higher prices. But, if there is a rally, it will probably form a lower high. Traders expect the rally to stall around 2850 – 2900.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 35 points in the Globex session. It will probably open with a gap up today. There is an increased chance of a 1 – 2 day rally because the daily and weekly charts have had strong rallies. However, the odds still favor 2 – 3 weeks of sideways to down trading. Therefore, the bears will look to sell strength and the bulls will use strength to take brief profits.<p>Since everyone wants a strong rally so that they can sell at a better price, there is a reduced chance of a strong bull trend day. The expectation is already priced in.<p>It is important to remember that the purpose of markets is to facilitate trading. They behave in a way to make people want to trade. The best way to accomplish that is by making the greatest number of traders as uncomfortable as possible. That means they constantly surprise and disappoint traders. This creates emotion and increases the amount of trading.<p>If today opens with a big gap up, the Emini will probably enter a trading range for an hour or two. The Emini should work higher for a day or two. But traders expect lots of time within trading ranges, like most days over the past month.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-sell-climax-then-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-5.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax then bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Legs in trading ranges reverse and constantly disappoint the bulls and bears. There is always both a sell and buy signal. The bears have a small double top. The bulls see the 2 day selloff as a pullback from last week’s rally.<p>This is only slightly more likely. If the selloff continues down to near the April 24 low, it will probably test the March 23 low. It does not matter which happens because the odds still favor a reversal up when the EURUSD is near the bottom. Until there is a clear, strong break out of the 8 month range, traders will continue to take quick profits and look for reversals.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off sharply early in the European session and then entered a 20 pip trading range. Day traders have been scalping for 4 hours. The bulls want a reversal up. They hope that the selloff is simply a test of last week’s low and that it becomes simply a pullback from the 2 week rally.<p>Every trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. However, whenever there is a trading range after a selloff, the chance of a resumption of the bear trend is always slightly more likely than a reversal up, But it is close enough to 50-50 for traders to treat is like it is 50-50. Day traders will continue to scalp today unless there is a strong breakout of the 4 hour range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-day-at-20-week-EMA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal day at 20 week EMA\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Then, a couple legs down for 2 – 3 weeks.<p>The daily chart has been sideways for a month. There have been many doji bars, like yesterday. Consequently, yesterday was not especially significant. Traders are still deciding if a selloff to 2600 has begun or if there will be one more brief leg up to above the April high first.<p>Even if the Emini were to break above the wedge top on the daily chart (the April high), there will should be more sellers than buyers up there. This is because the Emini is getting high in the 2 1/2 year trading range. It is overbought in a trading range. Traders believe that the 6 week rally is a bull leg in the trading range and not a resumption of the 2017 bull trend. They therefore expect reversals and not successful breakouts.<p>The top of the wedge is the April high. April is a High 1 buy signal bar on the monthly chart. Even though a break above the April high would trigger a monthly buy signal, it is a weak setup. This is because it follows 2 huge bear bars. Traders believe that the upside from here is small over the next month, despite the monthly buy signal.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 11 points in the Globex session. Because yesterday is a sell signal bar on the daily chart, traders will want to know what is below its low. That increases the chance that today will trade below yesterday’s low. That will trigger the daily sell signal. However, because the daily chart has been in a tight range for a month and yesterday was a doji bar, there might be more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low.<p>Trading ranges resist breaking out. Furthermore, on the 5 minute chart, there tends to be a lot of trading range price action. Most days over the past month have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Traders expect that again today.<p>Since a swing down to below 2600 should begin in May, there is an increased chance of some big bear bars this month. However, day traders will continue to bet on reversals until there is a clear, sustained trend.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-day-at-20-week-EMA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal day at 20 week EMA\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Since most legs up and down within trading ranges reverse, traders expect a leg up to begin soon.<p>It is still likely that the reversal will come from above the April 24 reversal. However, trading ranges constantly disappoint traders and tend to do things that appear less likely. Therefore, traders will not be surprised if the next leg up begins from below the April 24 low. It could even begin from below the March low. The real surprise would be if a break below the March low or above the March high finally led to a trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has sold off in a bear channel for 3 days. It is now near the bottom of the April trading range.<p>It reversed up a few hours ago to back to last week’s low. Last week was a bull bar on the weekly chart. That is a weak sell signal bar. Traders expect this week to close around its low instead of far below. Therefore, the EURUSD’s 3 day selloff will probably stall here for the remainder of the week.<p>A stall means a trading range on the 5 minute chart. The overnight reversal is a good candidate for the start of a trading range. The rally only went 30 pips in 3 hours. Also, the bars were small and the rally lacked consecutive big bull bars. Consequently, it looks like a bull leg in what will be a trading range.<p>Day traders will therefore look for reversals up and down to scalp for 10 – 20 pips. This lack of energy and this context makes a trend day unlikely today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That triggered a sell signal on the daily chart. This week triggered a minor sell signal on the weekly chart when Monday traded below last week’s low.<p>But the daily chart has been sideways for a month and it has had many minor reversals. It could not do this is the bears were strongly in control. With the Globex rally, the bulls have a 50% chance of a break above the April high before the selloff continues down to 2600. Traders want to see 2 or 3 consecutive strong bear bars before concluding that the Emini has begun its selloff down to 2600.<p>If there is a move to above the top of the wedge, the odds are it would fail. A reversal down would be a 2nd sell signal, which has a higher probability of starting a 2 – 3 week swing down.<p>Most days over the past month have had swings up and down on the 5 minute chart. Day traders will continue to look for intraday reversals and 2 – 3 hour swing trades.<h3>The importance of the end of the week</h3><p>Tomorrow is Friday so traders are starting to consider how the week will look on the weekly chart. This week triggered a minor weekly sell signal. However, it reversed up from below last week’s low.<p>The bulls would like the week to close above last week’s high. That would be a failed weekly sell signal. Of additional importance is that it would also mean that the wedge top on the daily chart failed. Furthermore, it would trigger the High 1 monthly buy signal.<p>Doing something bullish on all 3 time frames at the same time is unusual. It would be a sign of strength and increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 45 points in the Globex session. On the Globex daily chart, today traded below yesterday’s low and it is now near yesterday’s high. Today will probably form an outside up day on the daily Globex chart.<p>Today will open with a big gap up and near yesterday’s high. The bears would like a reversal down from a double top with Tuesday’s high. However, the April high is an important magnet just above the Globex high. With today’s gap up, there is a 50% chance that the bulls will achieve their goal today.<p>The bears have a clear wedge top on the daily chart. They have reversed down twice, but are failing a 2nd time. When the market fails twice, it often tries the opposite direction. That increases the chance of a bull trend today.<p>Can today reverse down from a double top with Tuesday’s high. Of course, and that would be good for the bears. If it today rallies to around Tuesday’s high and enters a trading range, day traders will look for a reversal down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-7.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The selloff is strong enough so that there is now almost a 50% chance of a break below the April 24 low.<p>Even though there is a 7 week trading range within a 9 month trading range, the weekly chart has been in a bear trend for 2 years. That means the odds of lower prices will always slightly favor the bears.<p>The EURUSD had been reversing every week for 7 weeks. Traders therefore expect a reversal up within a few days. This is true even if the EURUSD falls below the April 24 low first.<p>However, after 4 days down, traders will probably want the selling to stop for a couple days before looking to buy aggressively. On the 5 minute chart, they want to see the 4 day bear channel evolve into a trading range for a day or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off in a weak bear channel overnight. But, it is bouncing from below yesterday’s low.<p>The overnight channel had relatively big bounces. It is more of a trading range that is tilted down a little than a bear trend. This is a possible transition from a 4 day bear trend into a trading range on the 5 minute chart.<p>Even though the EURUSD has been forming lower highs and lows overnight, the new lows are only a few pips below the old. Traders are buying at the low. This is trading range price action.<p>After 4 days down and the trend weakening, there is less chance of a bear trend today. Also, the EURUSD is at the bottom of a 7 week trading range. Day traders expect a reversal up soon. But as I said, the bulls might 1st have to stop the selling for a day or two before they will buy for a swing up. That increases the chance that today will be a trading range or have a weak reversal up.<p>I have mentioned a few times this week that last week’s low is important. While last week was a Low 2 sell signal bar, it had a big bull body. That made it likely that there would be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>So far, this week is barely below last week’s low. That low will probably be a magnet for the rest of the week. It is another reason why today will probably not sell off.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It will probably try to form a small head and shoulders top on the 60 minute chart. Today might be the head.<p>This 4 day rally is the right shoulder of a bigger head and shoulders top. The April 17 left shoulder and the April 29 head both subdivided into smaller head and shoulders tops. The current right shoulder is trying to do the same.<p>The bulls have a 30% chance of the rally continuing up to a new all-time high this year. The odds favor a 2 – 3 week pullback to 2600 at some point in May.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

A reversal down would be a 2nd sell signal, which has a higher probability of starting a 2 – 3 week swing down.<p>Most days over the past month have had swings up and down on the 5 minute chart. Day traders will continue to look for intraday reversals and 2 – 3 hour swing trades.<h3>The importance of the end of the week</h3><p>Tomorrow is Friday so traders are starting to consider how the week will look on the weekly chart. This week triggered a minor weekly sell signal. However, it reversed up from below last week’s low.<p>The bulls would like the week to close above last week’s high. That would be a failed weekly sell signal. Of additional importance is that it would also mean that the wedge top on the daily chart failed. Furthermore, it would trigger the High 1 monthly buy signal.<p>Doing something bullish on all 3 time frames at the same time is unusual. It would be a sign of strength and increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 45 points in the Globex session. On the Globex daily chart, today traded below yesterday’s low and it is now near yesterday’s high. Today will probably form an outside up day on the daily Globex chart.<p>Today will open with a big gap up and near yesterday’s high. The bears would like a reversal down from a double top with Tuesday’s high. However, the April high is an important magnet just above the Globex high. With today’s gap up, there is a 50% chance that the bulls will achieve their goal today.<p>The bears have a clear wedge top on the daily chart. They have reversed down twice, but are failing a 2nd time. When the market fails twice, it often tries the opposite direction. That increases the chance of a bull trend today.<p>Can today reverse down from a double top with Tuesday’s high. Of course, and that would be good for the bears. If it today rallies to around Tuesday’s high and enters a trading range, day traders will look for a reversal down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-7.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-strong-bear-leg-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-7-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex strong bear leg in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has sold off for 4 days. The selloff is strong enough so that there is now almost a 50% chance of a break below the April 24 low.<p>Even though there is a 7 week trading range within a 9 month trading range, the weekly chart has been in a bear trend for 2 years. That means the odds of lower prices will always slightly favor the bears.<p>The EURUSD had been reversing every week for 7 weeks. Traders therefore expect a reversal up within a few days. This is true even if the EURUSD falls below the April 24 low first.<p>However, after 4 days down, traders will probably want the selling to stop for a couple days before looking to buy aggressively. On the 5 minute chart, they want to see the 4 day bear channel evolve into a trading range for a day or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off in a weak bear channel overnight. But, it is bouncing from below yesterday’s low.<p>The overnight channel had relatively big bounces. It is more of a trading range that is tilted down a little than a bear trend. This is a possible transition from a 4 day bear trend into a trading range on the 5 minute chart.<p>Even though the EURUSD has been forming lower highs and lows overnight, the new lows are only a few pips below the old. Traders are buying at the low. This is trading range price action.<p>After 4 days down and the trend weakening, there is less chance of a bear trend today. Also, the EURUSD is at the bottom of a 7 week trading range. Day traders expect a reversal up soon. But as I said, the bulls might 1st have to stop the selling for a day or two before they will buy for a swing up. That increases the chance that today will be a trading range or have a weak reversal up.<p>I have mentioned a few times this week that last week’s low is important. While last week was a Low 2 sell signal bar, it had a big bull body. That made it likely that there would be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>So far, this week is barely below last week’s low. That low will probably be a magnet for the rest of the week. It is another reason why today will probably not sell off.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It will probably try to form a small head and shoulders top on the 60 minute chart. Today might be the head.<p>This 4 day rally is the right shoulder of a bigger head and shoulders top. The April 17 left shoulder and the April 29 head both subdivided into smaller head and shoulders tops. The current right shoulder is trying to do the same.<p>The bulls have a 30% chance of the rally continuing up to a new all-time high this year. The odds favor a 2 – 3 week pullback to 2600 at some point in May.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls want a break above the April high. It is very important on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<p>Since April is a High 1 buy signal bar on the monthly chart, the bulls want a break above its high. Last week was a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. The bulls want this week to be outside up. They need the Emini to get above last week’s high, which was also the April high. Finally, that high is the top of the wedge on the daily chart. The bulls want the bears to give up.<p>But even if the bulls get a move above the April high, there will be sellers somewhere above that high and below the February high. Traders believe that there is not much left to this rally. We will soon find out if a 2 – 3 week pullback to 2600 has begun or if we 1st go above the April high.<p>It is still slightly more likely that the pullback is underway. However, the Emini has been sideways for a month. It has been reversing every 2 – 3 days. Traders are still deciding. In the meantime, they are betting on reversals.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 33 points in the Globex session. Last week’s high, which is the April high, of 2947.25 is only about 35 points higher. That is within reach today.<p>Because it is such an important price, there is an increased chance of a strong trend up or down. The bulls want a breakout above and then a rally to the March 3 high. The bears want a reversal down. This week would then simply be a test of the top of the wedge on the daily chart.<p>Most days over the past month have had a lot of trading range price action. They have typically had at least one swing up and one swing down. Day traders will expect that again today. But, they will be prepared to swing trade if there is a surprisingly big move in either direction.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-8.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday was similar to April 24 buy signal bar. The next day was the entry bar, which was weak.<p>Today is the entry bar for yesterday, and so far today is another doji. The bulls need a strong reversal up. That would be a sign that the price is too low. But today is only a doji bar. Traders are not rejecting this price. Therefore, the EURUSD might have to probe lower to find a price that is too low.<p>If there continues to be no strong rally today, the bears will see today as a small pullback their selloff from the May 1 high. Today would then be a Low 1 sell signal bar for Monday.<p>But unless it has a bear body closing on its low, it would be a weak sell signal bar. There would probably be buyers below its low and the bulls would again try for a reversal up next week.<h3>The weekly chart is important today</h3><p>The important price today is last week’s low. Last week was a Low 2 sell signal bar on the weekly chart. The sell triggered this week when this week traded below last week’s low.<p>But last week was a big bull bar. That is a weak sell signal bar. This week is currently back above last week”s low. It is therefore a weak entry bar for the bears.<p>The bears want the week to close on its low. At a minimum, they want it to close below last week’s low. That would increase the chance of lower prices for next week.<p>Without that, traders will continue to see the market as lethargic. They will keep betting on reversals and taking profits every few days.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above yesterday’s high overnight. That triggered the buy signal on the daily chat. However, it did not rally strongly. Instead, it is back at yesterday’s high. Also, the range has been small.<p>Last week’s low is 1.0801. That is 40 pips below the current price. With today’s small range, there is not much energy. Unless there is a surprisingly strong reversal down today, today will probably close above last week’s low. That will increase the chance of another attempt at a rally next week.<p>The daily and 5 minute charts have very little energy. Day traders are continuing to look for reversals and small scalps as they wait for the next strong breakout up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-in-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-8-2.png\" alt=\"Emini in broad bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a midday wedge reversal, but it failed. Today was a broad bull channel with a late rally to above the Globex high.<p>The bulls want to get above the April high. That would trigger a monthly buy signal. It would also run the stops for the bears who sold the nested wedge top on the daily chart. Traders are deciding if this week will form a lower high and lead to a 2nd leg down from the wedge, or if the Emini will first break above the top of the wedge. Either way, it should fall to around 2600 in May or June.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The near-term upside is probably to 3,000 to 3,100.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market has been in a tight trading range for 9 weeks. There is no sign that this is about to change. It is more likely to test the January low than the March high over the next few months.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has been sideways for 4 weeks. It is in Breakout Mode. Traders are looking for small reversals until there is a strong breakout.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Small double top in tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-triangle-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-9.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in triangle after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures has been sideways for 9 weeks on the weekly chart. The March 9 buy climax was the most extreme in history. It is a good candidate for the end of the 30 year bull trend.<p>However, when a bull trend ends, especially an extremely strong one, what follows is typically a trading range. And it can last for several years.<p>At some point, the bond market will begin a bear trend for a decade. That is more likely than the bull trend resuming much above the March high.<p>This week turned down from a micro double top with the April 3 high. This is a double top lower high major trend reversal. It could be the start of a 10 year bear trend. With the prominent tail below this week’s candlestick, it is more likely that the tight trading range will continue for at least another week.<p>If the next several weeks are big bear bars closing on their lows, there would be a 60% chance that this lower high will hold for many years. But if there is weak follow-through selling, traders will assume that the 9 week trading range will continue. If it does, there will probably be at least a brief breakout above this double top at some point.<h3>Where are the boundaries of a trading range?</h3><p>Trading ranges usually contain smaller trading ranges. The past 9 weeks have been in a tight range. This week might be the start of a breakout below that range. If so, this will probably lead to a bigger trading range.<p>For example, the selloff might test the March 18 low. The bond futures reversed up violently from that low. Traders expect that there will be buyers around that price again. Therefore, there might be a double bottom there. That would then be the bottom of a bigger trading range. The March high should remain as the top of that bigger range.<h3>2019 Final Bull Flag</h3><p>I said that the bottom of the range would be<em>around</em>the March low. I was intentionally vague. It is more likely that the bond futures will fall below that price. Why? Because when markets are in trading ranges and they are near support or resistance, they tend to exceed it before reversing.<p>The March low was a test of the August 28 high. That was the breakout point for the January to March buy climax. Legs in trading ranges usually pull back beyond breakout points, which are also support. Consequently, the bottom of the range will probably be below that high.<h3>Final Bull Flag in late 2019</h3><p>In late 2019, I said that the August-December trading range was tight and late in a bull trend. I wrote that it was a good candidate for the Final Bull Flag.<p>At the time, I said that traders should expect a bull breakout, but that the breakout would likely be a final buy climax. I talked about how a Final Bull Flag is a magnet and that traders should expect the buy climax to start a reversal down to the bottom of the flag. That is the November low.<p>It could take a long time to get there. However, there is a 70% chance that the bonds will trade back to that Final Bull Flag within a year or two.<h3>No negative interest rates</h3><p>The President has said several times that he wants negative interest rates. If that were to happen, the bond market would probably go above the March high.<p>However, the American public expects to<em>receive</em>interest on their savings accounts. They do not want to<em>pay</em>a bank interest on their savings accounts. That is an obvious negative side effect of negative interest rates.<p>Furthermore, seniors want inflation. Many depend on interest on savings accounts and money market accounts. If we had negative interest rates, tens of millions of seniors and their families would be outraged. It therefore will not happen. That makes it unlikely that the bond market will get much above the March high. In fact, the odds are that March will be the high for at least a decade.<h3>What about next week?</h3><p>Although this week was a bear bar, it did not break strongly below the 9 week range. In addition, it had a prominent tail below. It is therefore still only a leg in that range. Also, the bar on the weekly chart was not particularly big. That reduces the chance that it will be the start of a bear trend.<p>This week is currently testing the bottom of the 9 week range. Nothing is clear in trading ranges. Remember, a trading range exists because the bulls and bear are balanced. That makes it difficult for one side to dominate for very long. Traders therefore expect bad follow-through after strong bars. Reversals are more likely than trends.<p>However, there are magnets below. After 9 sideways weeks, traders expect the bond market to get to the 20 week EMA within a few weeks. It can get there by going sideways or down.<p>In addition, April had a tiny range. May is within the April range. This selloff should fall below the April low. Since April was a bull doji candlestick on the monthly chart (not shown), it is a weak sell signal bar. That means that there will probably be buyers not far below the April low.<h3>Bonds are probably working lower</h3><p>Over the next few weeks, the bond futures market will probably be sideways to down. At some point over the next year it should continue down to the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the January low. Then, within 1 – 3 years, it should get down to the August-December 2019 Final Bull Flag.<p>Now what about Trump’s negative interest rates? The chart says that the institutions do not believe they will happen.<h3>Buffet says no default</h3><p>As a side note, Warren Buffet this week said something interesting that I have said a few times over the past many years. When the U.S. sells bonds, people and other governments pay dollars to buy them. When our government buys them back, the government pays in dollars.<p>Because the Treasury decides how many dollars they want to print, we can never default on our debt, not matter how big it gets. We can simply print infinite money and pay off any debt.<p>But there is a side effect to everything. Countries who bought our bonds would effectively see that as effectively a default, even though it is not an actual default. It is a default in the sense that we did not live up to our promise of doing everything possible to keep their money safe.<p>If there are so many dollars that they are now worthless, any country who bought our bonds would be holding worthless bonds. Our dollars would not be able to buy anything from anyone. TVs, phones, French wine, German cars, shirts, shoes… forget all of it. Our quality of life would deteriorate horribly. We would be a poor country.<p>But, that is our unspoken back-up plan to guarantee that we will never default.<h3>Full faith and credit</h3><p>People who buy our bonds rely on our full faith and credit. They know we will pay them when the bonds mature. They understand that we will cheat if we have to and print infinite money, but there is less chance with our bonds than with those from any other country. Because the world trusts us, we get to sell bond in dollars and at low interest rates.<p>It is important to note that this is different from many other countries. For example, if Argentina, Venezuela, or Iran have inflation rates of 1,000 to 1,000,000% and it wants to sell bonds, no one would buy their bonds if those bonds were issued in their own currencies. Those countries would have to sell them in dollars and pay high interest rates because of the significant risk of default.<p>It is critically important that we remain trustworthy. This will allow us to always sell bonds in dollars and therefore never have to worry about defaulting.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Tight trading range, but bear channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-9-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart in triangle\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart has been in a tight trading range for 5 weeks. It is nested within a 9 month trading range. Traders are continuing to look for reversals.<p>It is now in the bottom half of the range. There will probably be a bounce for a few days next week. With the range as tight as it has been, the legs up and down are lasting only a week. For the past 2 years, legs up and down went 2 – 4 weeks before reversing.<p>The weekly chart is in Breakout Mode. It is reasonable to call it a 7 week triangle. When any market is in Breakout Mode, there is always both a reasonable buy and sell setup. Here, the bears have a double top with the the April 15 and May 1 highs. There is a head and shoulders bottom on the daily chart (not shown) that began with the April 6 low. Since most breakout attempts fail, the buy and sell patterns keep failing and new ones replace the old ones.<p>A clear breakout means consecutive closes beyond the range. The breakout is more likely to be successful if there are consecutive big trend bars closing on the extreme. This is true for both bull and bear breakouts. Without that, traders will expect every breakout attempt to reverse.<h3>Monthly chart in 2 year bear channel</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-ioi-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-9-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart in ioi breakout mode\"></a></figure><p>While the weekly chart is in a nested trading range, the monthly chart has been in a bear channel for 2 years. March was a big outside candlestick and April was an inside bar. This is an ioi pattern. Since that is a Breakout Mode pattern, April is both a buy and sell signal bar.<p>All 3 bars in the ioi had bear bodies and the the bear channel is holding below the 20 month EMA. This makes a bear breakout slightly more likely than a bull breakout. But with the 3 past months all having prominent tails below, this is a weak sell setup. There is a 50% chance that there will be more buyers than sellers below April’s low.<p>The bears want the bear channel to continue to below the January 2017 low. That was the start of a strong yearlong rally and it is therefore support. They then want the EURUSD to continue down to par (1.0).<p>The EURUSD should continue at least a little lower because there is no sign of a bottom. But because it is just above support, traders will buy if there is a strong reversal up on the monthly chart.<h2>The Covid-19 Pandemic</h2><h3>Number of projected deaths is misleading</h3><p>If you listen to Dr. Birx, she says that her worst case projection for U.S. deaths from Covid-19 is 240,000. Now, how is it that Dr. Brooks (me, I got my M.D. degree from the University of Chicago) still says that the number will be more like 500,000 to 2 million? Why do I continue to ignore the experts?<p>It is because Dr. Birx rarely completes her sentence. The part that she usually leaves of is “by August 1.” Her defense is that the models that project the number of deaths do not extend out more than 3 months.<p>That is a weak defense because she is misleading the public. She and Fauci will not lie, but they are being watched carefully by the political wing of the White House. They are not free to tell the whole truth because they will get fired.<p>It is important to note that their influence in the decision process is good. They are afraid that if they get fired, those good things might not continue. That puts them in a moral bind, and I think they are making the best choice.<h3>What will the final total of U.S. deaths be?</h3><p>Dr. Birx never talks about what the<em>final</em>total number of deaths will be, but to me, that is the most important number. In May of 1942, it would have been nice to know what the number of expected American deaths in World War II would be as of August 1, 1942. But at this point, who cares? All that matters now is that by the time the war ended, 400,000 Americans lost their lives.<p>In 3 years when the pandemic is behind us, will anyone ask how about the number of dead Americans as of August 1, 2020? That is ridiculous. And it is ridiculous that the media is not calling out Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci over their claim that 240,000 deaths is the worst case scenario.<p>You must complete the sentence. The worst case is 240,000 deaths… by August 1. That does not tell us how many Americans will be dead by the time there is a vaccine next year or once the pandemic has ended. I still think that Dr. Brooks has it right. Whatever number the media reports is wrong because it based on models that only look 3 months out.<h3>How many Americans will actually die?</h3><p>I mentioned last week that most Americans are more concerned about the number of deaths than about the economy. Whatever decision we make will be a trade off.<p>No one wants 38,000 Americans to die every year from automobile accidents. Yet, that’s what happens. We could always lower the speed limit to 20 miles an hour. Then maybe 5,000 people will die. But the majority of Americans would rather have the 38,000 dead.<p>We could raise the speed limit to 120 miles per hour. That might result in 100,000 dead. The lawmakers had to pick some number, knowing that they were also choosing what an acceptable number of deaths would be.<p>This the same thing with Covid-19. There is a vocal minority who refuse to live under any restrictions. Even if it is only 30%, it is enough to make sure that the pandemic will infect 30 – 70% of the country. If 30% get infected, that is 100 million people. A 1% death rate means 1 million dead Americans.<p>If the death rate ends up at 2% and 70% get infected, then 4 million people will die. I have been saying 500,000 to 1 million because I think that will be the final total.<h3>What is the R-factor?</h3><p>I have talked several times about how many people one infected person will infect. That number is called R0 (pronounced R-naught, and usually called the R-factor). The current R-factor for coronavirus is between 2 and 3. That means that each person will infect 2 to 3 more people.<p>But what happens once 99.99% of the population gets infected or immunized? Then the R-factor drops to zero. This is because it will be impossible for an infected person to come into contact with someone who is not immune. That is “herd immunity.” Herd refers to the population of the country. Once enough people get infected, the R-factor drops.<p>I wrote last week that once it falls below 1, the disease eventually goes away. This is because each group of 10 infected people (or any number) is replaced by a smaller group 2 weeks later. Over time, the groups continue to get smaller until it is unlikely that an infected person will come in contact with an uninfected or unvaccinated person. There will then be no new infections and the pandemic will be over.<h3>When does herd immunity exist?</h3><p>Immunity means that a person has antibodies in his blood that will attach to the virus and prevent it from entering, infecting, and killing cells. If it cannot enter cells, it cannot multiply, and other immune cells destroy the virus particles floating around in the blood stream.<p>The more contagious a virus is, the higher percentage of the population needs immunity before the pandemic ends. You might have heard that 70% is the number for Covid-19.<p><span style=\"background-color:#ff0\">If 70% of the population is immune to the coronavirus, there will be herd immunity.</span>Herd immunity means that the R-factor will be less that one. Once that happens, the number of cases will eventually fall to a low enough number to no longer be a major public health hazard.<h3>The math of the R-factor</h3><p>What happens once 70% of people are immune? Then when an infected person encounters people in next 2 weeks, only 30% of them can get sick since 70% are immune.<p>Because only 30% of exposed people can get sick, the R-factor will only be 30% of what is was. Thirty percent of an R-factor of 3 is 0.9, which is less than 1. An R-factor of less than 1 results in the total number of infections going down and ending the pandemic. That is why scientists say that herd immunity for the coronavirus only comes when 70% of the population has antibodies and cannot get infected.<p>Incidentally, measles has the highest R-factor of most common viruses. It is 12. If a contagious person is in a population of unimmunized people, he will on average infect 12 people. It is so contagious that the air in a room can infect someone 2 hours after a measles patient leaves. What is herd immunity for measles? For an R-factor of 12, herd immunity requires 95% of the population to be immune.<p>That is why it is so morally wrong for parents to not get their kids immunized for measles. If only 5% refuse, then measles remains in the population and babies not yet immunized can get it and die.<p>Don’t blame the parents for not getting their babies immunized shortly after birth. A baby’s immune system is not sufficiently mature to create enough antibodies to provide immunity until he is 1 year old.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>High 1 bull flag, but in 2 1/2 year trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-triangle-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-9-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart in triangle after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;formed a big bull inside bar in April and it closed near its high. It is a buy signal bar for a 2 bar (month) pullback in an 11 year bull trend.<p>May is currently a bull bar closing on its high. It should break above the April high within the next couple of weeks. That would trigger the High 1 bull flag buy signal on the monthly chart.<p>It is important to note that February and March formed a Bear Surprise. Therefore, there is a 70% chance that the Emini will have a 2nd leg sideways to down before making a new all-time high.<p>When there is a bear surprise, about 20% of the time the pullback (rally) goes above the top of the Bear Surprise before there is a 2nd leg down. But as I said, there is currently only a 30% chance that the 7 week rally will make a new high before there is a pullback.<p>And even if it does, there would still be a 70% chance of a 2nd leg sideways to down. Consequently, the odds are against a strong resumption up in the 11 year bull trend without the monthly chart going sideways for at least a few months.<p>Even if the Emini goes sideways for a few months, traders will still believe that the 2 1/2 year trading range is more likely to continue than it is for the bull trend to resume. They think that the upside potential is small over then next several months.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Failed top is now buy signal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-9-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has High 1 bull flag buy signal\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a sell signal bar last week after poking above the 20 week EMA. This week went below last week’s low. That triggered the sell signal.<p>However, for 6 weeks, traders bought above the low of the prior week. This week, the bulls finally had an opportunity to buy below the low of the prior week. They bought aggressively and this week closed on its high. This week is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for next week.<p>It is important to note that the 2 month selloff was incredibly strong. That makes it unlikely that this rally will break above the February high without pulling back for several weeks along the way.<p>The 6 week bull microchannel is unsustainable and climactic. The 2 recent dojis are a sign that the trend is becoming more 2 sided. Consequently, traders should expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin in May or June. The longer the rally lasts, the longer the pullback will be.<p>But the reversal up has been exceptionally strong. Traders believe that the Emini should hold above the March low for the remainder of the year.<h3>Trading range for the remainder of 2020</h3><p>What’s left? If the Emini can’t get above the high or below the low of the 2 1/2 year trading range, that trading range will continue for the remainder of the year. The bottom of the range might be around the December 2018 low below 2400 and the top might be around the March 3 lower high on the daily chart. That is just above 3100.<p>Over the next few months, the Emini will probably trade in a relatively tight range. It has been sideways between 2700 and 3000 for a month. It could continue like this for another month or more.<p>However, at some point in the next few months, it should retrace about half of the 7 week rally. That means traders expect a pullback to between 2500 and 2600 in May or June. Traders believe that the upside from here is not great. If a market cannot go one way, it typically tries the other way. Therefore, since a new high from this rally is not likely, traders expect the Emini to trade down soon<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Likely failed nested wedge top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-futures-candlestick-chart-testing-nested-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-9-5.png\" alt=\"Emini futures candlestick chart testing nested wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The S&amp;P500 Emini futures market reversed down last week from a wedge top on the daily chart. The 3rd leg up in the wedge was a micro wedge. That means that it is a wedge on a smaller time frame, like the 60 minute chart. There is therefore a nested wedge buy climax on the daily chart. A nested pattern has a higher probability of leading to a reversal.<p>When a wedge top or any buy climax reverses, traders expect at least a couple legs sideways to down. The selloff typically reaches at least to the bottom of the pullback from the 2nd leg up in the wedge. That is the April 21 low of 2717.25.<p>It usually continues down to around the bottom of the 1st pullback. That is the April 1 low of 2434.25. However, that target it probably too far down for the reversal down from this top to reach it. But, the Emini might get there later in the year.<p>As I said, traders expect at least a couple legs down. That means there is a bounce at some point. It forms a lower high and then there is a 2nd leg down. Traders are wondering if this week formed the lower high. It might have, but the monthly and weekly charts make traders believe that the Emini will trade higher.<h3>This wedge is also a tight bull channel</h3><p>When a wedge top is a tight bull channel, about half of the time, the 1st reversal down will fail. This week’s rally was strong. The April high is the top of the monthly buy signal bar. I mentioned above that the weekly chart has a buy signal. There are 3 moving averages (100, 150, and 200 day) just above the April high. All of these factors make it likely that the Emini will go above the top of the wedge before reversing down.<p>Once there is a reversal down, the pullback from the 1st leg down is a lower high major trend reversal. It often also is a right shoulder of a head and shoulders top.<p>Another guideline for the extent of the selloff from a wedge top or buy climax is that it usually has about half as many bars as there were in the wedge. The rally lasted 6 weeks and therefore I have been saying that the reversal down could be 2 – 3 weeks. It could be more, but not less. The longer the rally lasts, the longer the pullback will likely be.<h3>What happens if the Emini breaks above the April high?</h3><p>The top of the wedge on the daily chart is the April high. Remember, April is a buy signal bar on the monthly chart. The monthly bulls want the buy signal to trigger. They need the Emini to go above the April high. As I wrote above, if it does, traders do not expect the rally to continue up to the February high.<p>If next week breaks above the top of the wedge, then traders will conclude that this wedge top on the daily chart has failed. They will then look for another pattern.<p>When the Emini breaks above the top of a wedge, in general, there is a 50% chance of another reversal down and a 50% chance of a strong breakout with at least a couple legs up.<p>This depends on context. The daily chart is now overbought after a huge bear trend. In this case, there is at least a 60% chance that a break above the April high will reverse down again within the next couple of weeks.<p>Traders will then renumber the legs of the wedge. The old 2nd leg was strong and traders will then call it the new 1st leg. That is the April 17 high. The break above the April high will be the 3rd leg. Traders would again look for a reversal down for several weeks.<h3>What to expect next week</h3><p>The Emini will probably go above the April high within a couple weeks. This should happen early next week. That will trigger the buy signals on the weekly and monthly charts. It will also run the stops of the bears who shorted the wedge top.<p>It should also reach that cluster of moving averages around the 3,000 Big Round Number. The rally might continue up to the March 3 start of the parabolic wedge selloff.<p>But, it should fail between 3,000 and 3,125. There is only a 30% chance that it will continue directly up to a new high.<p>The longer it lasts, the deeper and longer the reversal down will be. At the moment, once there is a reversal, it will probably fall to below the March 31 high. That was the breakout point of the 2nd leg up.<p>There is currently a gap between the April 21 pullback and that breakout point. Since the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years and gaps in trading ranges usually close, the Emini should fall to below 2600 within the next couple months.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

They know the odds favor a move down to 2600 beginning in May.<p>After 2 big bear bars on the monthly chart, the monthly buy signal is minor. There will probably be sellers below the all-time high. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down to begin within a month or two.<p>Last week triggered a sell signal on the weekly chart. But the week closed on its high. It is a High 1 buy signal bar for this week.<p>There is a nested wedge top on the daily chart. The top is the April high. Last week’s rally might be forming a lower high double top for a 2nd leg down. But the momentum up is strong and there are buy signals on the weekly and monthly chart. If this week does not reverse down, the Emini probably go above the April high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 34 points in the Globex session. It might gap below Friday’s low. Since Friday was a big bull day, if today is a big bear day with very little overlap of Friday’s range, Friday would become a bull trap. Traders would then conclude that the move down to 2600 might have begun.<p>Today’s price action is important because it will affect the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.

But if they cannot get today to close near its low, traders will suspect that the Emini will have to go more sideways to up before reversing down.<p>If today is a big bull trend day, traders would look for a break above last week’s high and then the April high this week.<p>The Globex session sold off in a tight bear channel. There were several breakouts along the way. Each was a sell climax. The first reversal up from a tight bear channel is typically minor. Traders should expect the overnight bear channel to evolve into a trading range early today. What follows will effect the rest of the week. If today is a big bear day, it could be the start of a 2 – 3 week selloff.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-in-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-11.png\" alt=\"Emini in broad bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

But Friday was a doji, which is a weak sell signal bar. The signal is coming at the bottom of a trading range. That is bad context for a short because legs in trading ranges usually reverse instead of becoming trends.<p>And finally, today is not a big bear bar closing near its low. It is a weak entry bar, but there are many hour left before today ends. There is a small chance that it could be very bearish by the close of the day.<p>The EURUSD is still on Thursday’s buy signal. That was a strong buy signal bar and it formed a High 2 bull flag from the March 27 rally. It is also a buy signal bar for a higher low major trend reversal and a head and shoulders bottom.<h3>Should get reversal or bear breakout this week</h3><p>This week is important. Traders will decide if the EURUSD is beginning a move up to the May 1 double top and then possibly the March high. Because of the strong buy signal bar last week and the strong legs up in March, the odds are slightly better for the bulls.<p>However, the monthly chart is still in a 2 year bear channel. Traders know that there is almost a 50% chance that the EURUSD will break below the March low and continue down to par.<p>For 2 years, traders have correctly bet on reversals. Whether or not the bear trend ultimately continues down to par, reversals every few weeks are still more likely than the start of a trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market triggered a weak sell signal overnight by falling below Friday’s low. However, the breakout was weak and the EURUSD was been sideways in a 15 pip range over the 5 hours since the breakout.<p>Traders are deciding whether the breakout will fail or succeed. If today closes near its high, even if it is not a big bull day, today will form a buy signal bar on the daily chart. There is a micro double bottom and double bottom at the bottom of a trading range. The bulls would then need a strong rally tomorrow to convince traders that this week will trade up.<p>The bears want more than just a close below Friday’s low. They would like today to be a big bear bar closing on its low and below last week’s low. Traders would then conclude that the EURUSD was probably going to break below the April 24 buy signal bar.<h3>Markets tend to continue doing what they have been doing</h3><p>Market’s have inertia. Since today has been in a tight trading range with small bars, the day will probably remain a scalper’s market. At a minimum, the bulls want today to close above yesterday’s low and today’s open. Both will be magnets today. The bears want today to close on its low and below Friday’s low. That would increase the chance of lower prices for the rest of the week.<p>After being sideways for a month in a tight trading range within a 9 month trading range, traders expect a 2 – 3 week move up or down to begin within a week or two. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Day traders will continue to scalp while they wait for the breakout.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-outside-up-day-near-April-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day near April high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The 100, 150, and 200 day simple moving averages are also magnets above.<p>While the rally is climactic, there is no strong reversal down yet.

The key price is the April high. The bulls will probably break above it this week and maybe today. That would trigger a monthly High 1 buy signal. It would also run the stops on the bears who sold the wedge top on the daily chart.<p>Traders pay attention to simple moving averages. The 100, 150, and 200 day moving averages are just above the April high. Also, the March 3 lower high was the start of the March parabolic wedge. Its high is an additional target above.<p>However, the February-March selloff was exceptionally strong. Consequently, the Emini has only a 30% chance of a new high this year. Bu despite the growing buy climax, there is no strong reversal down yet.<h3>Possible double top with top of wedge</h3><p>The bears want a double top with the top of the wedge on the daily chart. That is the April 20 high of 2947.25, which is about 15 points above the current Globex price.<p>Double tops are rarely perfect. The 2nd high is typically a little higher or lower than the first. There is currently less than a 50% chance of a quick, strong reversal down from the April 20 top of the daily wedge. The rally will probably continue to 3000 and the daily moving averages before the bears will try again.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. There are several strong magnets above and the bull trend has been strong. Traders expect higher prices. That increases the chance of bull trends on the 5 minute chart.<p>It is important to note that most days over the past month have had at least one 2 hour rally and one 2 hour selloff. Consequently, even though the bull trend has been strong on the daily chart, day traders are still expecting swings in both directions.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-outside-up-day-near-April-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-12.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day near April high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That usually leads to a reversal up. This is especially true when there are bull bars closing near their high. April 24 and May 7 are 2 examples.<p>Today might be another, especially if it closes above yesterday’s high. It is already an outside up bar, and a close above yesterday’s high would be an additional sign of strong bulls.<p>Every trading range always has both a reasonable buy and sell signal. The bears have a double top with the April 15 and May 1 highs. The May 7 low is the neckline. If the EURUSD breaks below that price, it will trigger the double top. The bears would then look for a measured move down from there.<p>The bulls have a head and shoulders bottom. It will trigger if there is a rally to above the May 1 high. That double top is the neckline. If the bulls get their breakout, they will look for a measured move up.<h3>The EURUSD is still in a trading range</h3><p>Legs in trading ranges reverse much more often than they continue into trends. The EURUSD is now at the bottom of a month-long trading range. A reversal up for 2 – 3 weeks is more likely than a bear breakout.<p>But until there is a breakout, the chart is still in Breakout Mode. That means the probability can never be too far from 50-50 for the bulls or bears.<p>The bulls currently have about a 55% chance of a rally to the top of the range. The probability will go up if they get a couple big bull bars this week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low and reversed up to above yesterday’s high. Today is an outside up day, which is a sign of strong bulls. The location at the bottom of a month-long trading range is good for the bulls. Traders are wondering if today is the start of a 2 – 3 week rally.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high and above yesterday’s high. That would indicate buying pressure and it will attract more buyers. It would increase the chance that a rally has begun on the daily chart.<p>The bulls have already accomplished their goal of creating an outside up day. They do not need the EURUSD to go any higher today. That reduces the chance of a big bull trend from here today.<p>But they still want today to close above yesterday’s high and near today’s high. Consequently, they will buy 20 pip selloffs today.<p>The bears always want the opposite of the bulls. But the overnight bull channel has been tight. That makes it very difficult for the bears to make money shorting. They need to stop the bull trend and begin a trading range.<p>That will probably happen at some point. If there is a 30 pip selloff, the day traders will begin to sell rallies for scalps,in addition to buying pullbacks. Until they, it will be easier to make money buying pullbacks.<p>An outside up day has a 20% chance of a reversal back down to below yesterday’s low. If there is a strong reversal down today, day traders will consider that possibility.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-consecutive-outside-days-so-oo-pattern.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini consecutive outside days so oo pattern\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then entered a trading range for a few hours. The bears got strong trend resumption down for the 2nd half of the day.<p>Yesterday was an outside up day and today was a huge outside down day. This is an oo (outside-outside) pattern, which is rare on the daily chart. Today is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>If tomorrow trades below today’s low, it would trigger a double top sell signal with the wedge top.

The key price is the April high. The bulls will probably break above it this week and maybe today. That would trigger a monthly High 1 buy signal. It would also run the stops on the bears who sold the wedge top on the daily chart.<p>Traders pay attention to simple moving averages. The 100, 150, and 200 day moving averages are just above the April high. Also, the March 3 lower high was the start of the March parabolic wedge. Its high is an additional target above.<p>However, the February-March selloff was exceptionally strong. Consequently, the Emini has only a 30% chance of a new high this year. Bu despite the growing buy climax, there is no strong reversal down yet.<h3>Possible double top with top of wedge</h3><p>The bears want a double top with the top of the wedge on the daily chart. That is the April 20 high of 2947.25, which is about 15 points above the current Globex price.<p>Double tops are rarely perfect. The 2nd high is typically a little higher or lower than the first. There is currently less than a 50% chance of a quick, strong reversal down from the April 20 top of the daily wedge. The rally will probably continue to 3000 and the daily moving averages before the bears will try again.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. There are several strong magnets above and the bull trend has been strong. Traders expect higher prices. That increases the chance of bull trends on the 5 minute chart.<p>It is important to note that most days over the past month have had at least one 2 hour rally and one 2 hour selloff. Consequently, even though the bull trend has been strong on the daily chart, day traders are still expecting swings in both directions.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-outside-up-day-near-April-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-12.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day near April high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-bottom-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-12-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex head and shoulders bottom higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is near the bottom of a month-long trading range. That usually leads to a reversal up. This is especially true when there are bull bars closing near their high. April 24 and May 7 are 2 examples.<p>Today might be another, especially if it closes above yesterday’s high. It is already an outside up bar, and a close above yesterday’s high would be an additional sign of strong bulls.<p>Every trading range always has both a reasonable buy and sell signal. The bears have a double top with the April 15 and May 1 highs. The May 7 low is the neckline. If the EURUSD breaks below that price, it will trigger the double top. The bears would then look for a measured move down from there.<p>The bulls have a head and shoulders bottom. It will trigger if there is a rally to above the May 1 high. That double top is the neckline. If the bulls get their breakout, they will look for a measured move up.<h3>The EURUSD is still in a trading range</h3><p>Legs in trading ranges reverse much more often than they continue into trends. The EURUSD is now at the bottom of a month-long trading range. A reversal up for 2 – 3 weeks is more likely than a bear breakout.<p>But until there is a breakout, the chart is still in Breakout Mode. That means the probability can never be too far from 50-50 for the bulls or bears.<p>The bulls currently have about a 55% chance of a rally to the top of the range. The probability will go up if they get a couple big bull bars this week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low and reversed up to above yesterday’s high. Today is an outside up day, which is a sign of strong bulls. The location at the bottom of a month-long trading range is good for the bulls. Traders are wondering if today is the start of a 2 – 3 week rally.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high and above yesterday’s high. That would indicate buying pressure and it will attract more buyers. It would increase the chance that a rally has begun on the daily chart.<p>The bulls have already accomplished their goal of creating an outside up day. They do not need the EURUSD to go any higher today. That reduces the chance of a big bull trend from here today.<p>But they still want today to close above yesterday’s high and near today’s high. Consequently, they will buy 20 pip selloffs today.<p>The bears always want the opposite of the bulls. But the overnight bull channel has been tight. That makes it very difficult for the bears to make money shorting. They need to stop the bull trend and begin a trading range.<p>That will probably happen at some point. If there is a 30 pip selloff, the day traders will begin to sell rallies for scalps,in addition to buying pullbacks. Until they, it will be easier to make money buying pullbacks.<p>An outside up day has a 20% chance of a reversal back down to below yesterday’s low. If there is a strong reversal down today, day traders will consider that possibility.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-consecutive-outside-days-so-oo-pattern.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini consecutive outside days so oo pattern\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then entered a trading range for a few hours. The bears got strong trend resumption down for the 2nd half of the day.<p>Yesterday was an outside up day and today was a huge outside down day. This is an oo (outside-outside) pattern, which is rare on the daily chart. Today is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>If tomorrow trades below today’s low, it would trigger a double top sell signal with the wedge top. The bears are hoping that this is the end of the 8 week rally. They expect a test of 2600 in May or June. Today could be the start.<p>The 7 week rally is strong. Also, there are several magnets above. These include the 3 moving averages on the daily chart, the 3,000 Big Round Number, and the April high. Unless tomorrow is a strong bear day, many traders will expect the Emini to reach the targets above.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was therefore an outside down day. What is interesting is that Monday was an outside up day. Consecutive outside days (an oo pattern) are rare on the daily chart.<p>An oo pattern is a Breakout Mode setup. Traders theoretically sell below yesterday’s low and buy above its high.<p>The bears see yesterday as a sell signal bar for a double top with the April wedge rally. But yesterday was huge. When a sell signal bar is big, the stop is far above for bears who sell below the bar. Many bears want smaller risk. Instead of selling, they wait for a 50% bounce and then sell.<p>With fewer bears willing to sell below a big bear bar, there is often a bounce for a few days. Traders would then decide if that small rally was a resumption of the bull trend or a pullback in a new bear trend.<p>Yesterday was surprisingly big. A bear Surprise Bar typically has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. Consequently, even if the Emini bounces for a few days, there are many bears looking to sell the bounce.<h3>End of rally or bull flag?</h3><p>Is this the start of a move down to 2600? It is a good candidate, but traders want to see follow-through selling within a week or so.<p>If today is a bull day, it will be a High 2 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. They will see it as a higher low double bottom with the low of w weeks ago. Traders will again believe that the rally will reach 3000 and the 100, 150, and 200 day moving averages before there is a pullback to 2600.<p>Can today rally strongly and totally erase yesterday’s selloff? Yes, but the 1st reversal up from a tight bear channel typically is minor. The bulls will probably need at least a small trading range and a major trend reversal.<p>Most likely, today will have at least one swing up and one swing down. Today is the follow-through day after a bear breakout. If it closes below the open, it will form a bear bar on the daily chart. That would confirm yesterday’s big bear breakout and increase the chance of lower prices.<p>Because of the month-long trading range, traders should expect disappointing follow-through. Today will probably close around its open and have a small bull or bear body. There is only a 25% chance of either a big bull or bear day today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 14 points in the Globex session. As strong as yesterday’s selloff was, it was climactic. There is therefore a 75% chance that today will begin a 2 hour sideways to up move by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>Since the daily chart has been in a trading range for a month, today will likely have a lot of trading range trading after yesterday’s big bear trend day. Trading ranges usually have bad follow-through. Traders should expect the bears to be disappointed today by a lack of strong follow-through selling today.<p>But if today is a 2nd big bear day, then the price action will have changed into trending price action on the daily chart. That would significantly increase the chance that this is the start of a move down to 2600.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-consecutive-outside-days-so-oo-pattern.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-13.png\" alt=\"Emini consecutive outside days so oo pattern\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

A trading range always has both a credible buy and sell signal. Reversals are more likely than successful breakouts.<p>The bulls see the chart as reversing up from a head and shoulders bottom. However, they need a strong breakout above the 6 day tight trading range. At a minimum, they want a bull bar closing near its high and above yesterday’s high. If they get that, traders will conclude that this is the start of a 2 week rally to the May 1 high or above.<p>But, if today does not close above yesterday’s high, traders will suspect that the bulls are not strong. If today or tomorrow is a bear bar closing near its low, there would then be a small Low 2 bear flag with the high from 3 weeks ago. Traders would then expect the bottom to fail. A strong reversal down this week would make a test of the March low likely next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied in a tight bull channel overnight. It is testing yesterday’s high.<p>Yesterday was a weak outside up day. The bulls need today to close above yesterday’s high to convince traders that last week was the start of a 2 – 3 week rally. Therefore, the bulls will buy pullbacks to get the day to close at its high and above yesterday’s high.<p>Since today is a possible breakout day, there is an increased chance of an acceleration up today. So far, day traders have only been buying. The bull channel is tight. But the bars are not big. This is not aggressive buying.<p>If the EURUSD starts to go sideways here, around yesterday’s high, the bears will begin to sell. Remember, they would like today to close near its low. Today would then be a sell signal bar on the daily chart.<h3>Market have inertia</h3><p>What is most likely? Markets have inertia. They tend to continue to do what they’s been doing. The EURUSD is in a 6 day tight trading range. It will probably stay there today.<p>The bull channel is tight so day traders so have have only been buying. But if the EURUSD has a 20 pip pullback around yesterday’s high, day traders will begin to sell as well.<p>Since today’s appearance can affect the direction over the next week, there is an increased chance of a bull breakout or a reversal down. The 1st reversal down will probably be minor. Consequently, the downside risk over the next couple of hours is small. The bears will probably need a 1 – 2 hour trading range before they can get a reversal down.<p>Most likely, today will soon enter a 20 pip trading range around yesterday’s high. Then, it will try to either breakout or reverse tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-wedge-bull-flag-and-then-outside-down-week.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bull flag and then outside down week\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is probably the start of a move down to 2600. This week is now an outside down week on the weekly chart.<p>Since the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years, the path will probably not be straight down. Although unlikely at the moment, it still might go above the April high and test the 200 day moving average first.<p>The bulls are hoping that these 2 days are just a test of the bottom of the 3 week trading range and 2800. But the 2 big bear days constitute a bear surprise. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg down. There might be a bounce tomorrow after the short covering rally into the close today.<p>The bulls need a strong reversal up tomorrow to make traders think that the selloff might simply forming a double bottom with the May 4 low. That is the neckline of the double top. A measured move down from below it would take the Emini to around my minimum target, which is the March 31 high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

A trading range always has both a credible buy and sell signal. Reversals are more likely than successful breakouts.<p>The bulls see the chart as reversing up from a head and shoulders bottom. However, they need a strong breakout above the 6 day tight trading range. At a minimum, they want a bull bar closing near its high and above yesterday’s high. If they get that, traders will conclude that this is the start of a 2 week rally to the May 1 high or above.<p>But, if today does not close above yesterday’s high, traders will suspect that the bulls are not strong. If today or tomorrow is a bear bar closing near its low, there would then be a small Low 2 bear flag with the high from 3 weeks ago. Traders would then expect the bottom to fail. A strong reversal down this week would make a test of the March low likely next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied in a tight bull channel overnight. It is testing yesterday’s high.<p>Yesterday was a weak outside up day. The bulls need today to close above yesterday’s high to convince traders that last week was the start of a 2 – 3 week rally. Therefore, the bulls will buy pullbacks to get the day to close at its high and above yesterday’s high.<p>Since today is a possible breakout day, there is an increased chance of an acceleration up today. So far, day traders have only been buying. The bull channel is tight. But the bars are not big. This is not aggressive buying.<p>If the EURUSD starts to go sideways here, around yesterday’s high, the bears will begin to sell. Remember, they would like today to close near its low. Today would then be a sell signal bar on the daily chart.<h3>Market have inertia</h3><p>What is most likely? Markets have inertia. They tend to continue to do what they’s been doing. The EURUSD is in a 6 day tight trading range. It will probably stay there today.<p>The bull channel is tight so day traders so have have only been buying. But if the EURUSD has a 20 pip pullback around yesterday’s high, day traders will begin to sell as well.<p>Since today’s appearance can affect the direction over the next week, there is an increased chance of a bull breakout or a reversal down. The 1st reversal down will probably be minor. Consequently, the downside risk over the next couple of hours is small. The bears will probably need a 1 – 2 hour trading range before they can get a reversal down.<p>Most likely, today will soon enter a 20 pip trading range around yesterday’s high. Then, it will try to either breakout or reverse tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-wedge-bull-flag-and-then-outside-down-week.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bull flag and then outside down week\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is probably the start of a move down to 2600. This week is now an outside down week on the weekly chart.<p>Since the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years, the path will probably not be straight down. Although unlikely at the moment, it still might go above the April high and test the 200 day moving average first.<p>The bulls are hoping that these 2 days are just a test of the bottom of the 3 week trading range and 2800. But the 2 big bear days constitute a bear surprise. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg down. There might be a bounce tomorrow after the short covering rally into the close today.<p>The bulls need a strong reversal up tomorrow to make traders think that the selloff might simply forming a double bottom with the May 4 low. That is the neckline of the double top. A measured move down from below it would take the Emini to around my minimum target, which is the March 31 high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini turned down from just below the top of the wedge on the daily chart.<p>This week traded above last week’s high and then below its low. It is an outside down week on the weekly chart.<p>The bears want this week to close below last week’s low. It would then be a stronger outside down candlestick on the weekly chart. Also, it would be a 2nd reversal down from the 20 week EMA. A 2nd attempt to sell off has a higher probability of success.<p>This is probably the start of a move down to 2600. However, if the bulls get a reversal up today or tomorrow, traders will wonder if the selloff is a bear trap. The bulls then would again try to break above the wedge top and test the 200 day moving average around 3,000.<p>It is important to note that yesterday repeatedly tried to break below the low of 2 weeks ago, yet it kept reversing up. It would have been better for the bears is instead the Emini collapsed below that support and closed far below it.<p>Will today be a 3rd consecutive strong bear day? Probably not because it is in a 2 1/2 year trading range. Trading ranges tend to disappoint traders. Also, there was short-covering into yesterday’s close. Today should have at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading.<p>But the bears will sell the 1st 1 – 2 day bounce. Traders expect lower prices over the next 2 – 3 weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 32 points in the Globex session. The bears want today to close far below the May 4 low of 2788.50. That is the neckline of the 2 week double top. A big bear breakout will make it likely that the Emini will continue down to 2600 in May or June.<p>The bulls always want the opposite. Traders know that the bears have not had 3 consecutive strong bear days since February. They will watch for a reversal up today. It can come at any time.<p>If the bears do get a 3rd consecutive bear day, then the move will probably continue down to 2600. There will be bounces along the way, especially since the current selloff is already extreme. Traders will sell the 1st 1 – 3 day bounce.<p>Since traders want to know if the bears can get a 3rd strong bear day, the bulls might wait for a few hours to see how strong the bears can be. If they conclude that the bears are not strong enough, they will try to create a midday reversal. If they get a strong reversal, the 3 day selloff could become just a pullback in the rally up to 3000 and the 200 day MA.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-wedge-bull-flag-and-then-outside-down-week.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-14.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bull flag and then outside down week\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That range is at the bottom of a month-long range and a 9 month range.<p>The bulls have had many good attempts at reversing up for 2 months. Yet, they are unable to get a sustained rally. The chart is looking heavy.<p>While the reversals and strong bull bars are good for the bulls, the inability to do what appears likely is bad. At some point, if a market repeatedly tries to do something and it is unable to do it, it will try the opposite.<p>Traders believe that these repeated failures by the bulls mean that those bull bars and rallies are not as good as they appear. There is a 50% chance that the EURUSD will break to the downside and fall to par rather than rallying above the March high.<p>Yesterday reversed down from the 20 day EMA. it was the 2nd reversal down in 4 days. This is a Low 2 bear flag below the EMA. The sell signal triggered overnight when today traded below yesterday’s low.<p>The bulls need a reversal back up within the next few days to make traders think that the bottoming process is continuing. If they fail to get what they need, the bears will get a break below the April 24 low and then probably below the March 23 low.<h3>The EURUSD might trigger a monthly sell signal this week</h3><p>In my weekend reports, I mentioned several times that there is an ioi Breakout Mode setup on the monthly chart. If the EURUSD falls below the April low, it will trigger the monthly sell signal.<p>Remember, the monthly chart has been in a bear trend for 2 years. Most of the closes have been below the 20 month EMA. A break below the April low will be a reminder that the bears are still in control. Traders will then expect a test of the January 2017 major higher low and then par (1.0).<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a brief breakout below yesterday’s low overnight, but it has been sideways for 3 hours. Yesterday was a good looking sell signal bar on the daily chart. Today is the entry bar. If today closes near its low, today will be a good entry bar. That will increase the chance of a break below the April low, which would trigger a monthly sell signal.<p>Because the EURUSD has been sideways for 3 hours, the bulls are willing to buy reversals up from the bottom. This is especially true because the EURUSD is at the bottom of a 7 day tight trading range. Furthermore, the bulls still have a potential head and shoulders bottom on the daily chart. If they can get a reversal to back above yesterday’s low and today’s open, today will be a buy signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The bears do not need to do more today than what they have already done. If today closes where it is now, the daily chart will have a good bear body and be a good entry bar for the Low 2 sell signal. That would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow. They will continue to sell rallies, trying to put the close near the low.<p>The lack of sustained selling over night reduces the chance of a big move down from here. When there is no energy, the market tends to stay sideways. Day traders scalp in both directions as they wait for a breakout in either direction.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-then-bull-trend-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and then bull trend channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Tomorrow is now a buy signal bar on the daily chart.<p>The bulls want the Emini to continue up to the 200 day moving average, which is at the 3,000 Big Round Number. That would trigger the monthly buy signal and run the stops on the bears who are short from the wedge top and double top.<p>What is now more likely, a pullback from a 2 day selloff and then a continuation down to 2600? Or, a resumption of the bull trend? The extreme buy climax and the strong reversal down from the wedge and double top make the selloff slightly more likely. A lot depends on tomorrow.

That is the neckline of the 3 week double top. Yesterday is now a High 2 bull flag buy signal bar for today. The bulls want the rally to continue up to the 200 day moving average and the 3000 Big Round Number.<p>But if today is anything less than a strong bull day, traders will expect a 2nd leg down. If they get the start of a 2nd leg down within the next few days, they will then look for a selloff to 2600 in May or June.<p>Today is Friday so the weekly chart is important. This week is an outside down week. There is now a micro double top at the 20 week EMA, which is a reflection of the double top on the daily chart.<p>If the bears can get the week to close below last week’s low, traders will expect a 2 – 3 week selloff to 2600. If the week closes well above last week’s low, the bulls will try to continue the bull trend up to 3000.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 30 points in the Globex session. Yesterday formed a bull channel on the 5 minute chart. A bull channel is a bear flag because traders know that there is usually a bear breakout and then a transition into a trading range.<p>That increases the chance of a lot of trading range price action today. But yesterday’s range was big. Even if today is a trading range day, there should be at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>The Emini is in the middle of the week’s range. It might not be able to reach the top or bottom of the range today. When that is the case, it often pays attention to the middle, which is 2850. If the bulls can get the week to close above the midpoint, it would be a sign that they won the week. A close below the midpoint is a sign that the bears were a little stronger.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-and-then-bull-trend-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-15.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax and then bull trend channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid.&nbsp;Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective.

It has been in a tight trading range with small ranges for 8 days. That range in near the bottom of a month-long range, which is nested in an 8 month range.<p>Every trading range always has both buy and sell setups. The bulls have a head and shoulders bottom. The right shoulder is a small double bottom. There is a April/May double top and a 4 day double top bear flag.<p>Traders believe that the current price is just above right. There is no energy to change it.<p>But, the price of any financial market does not stay in a tight range forever. Traders expect a breakout soon. But, in what direction? The market could not be in such a tight range if either the bulls or bears had an advantage.<p>This is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is a 50% chance of a breakout up or down. While waiting for the breakout, day traders are just looking to scalp small reversals up and down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 50 pip range overnight. Today’s low is above yesterday’s low. It just broke above yesterday’s high in the past 10 minutes. The bulls hope that the 50 pip rally is the start of a bull trend day.<p>Today is Friday so support and resistance on the weekly chart are important. This brief rally is stalling at the open of the week. It’s purpose might be simply to convert the candlestick on the weekly chart to a doji bar from a bear bar.<p>Day traders have been disappointed by moves up and down for 2 weeks and they have been taking quick profits. If the bulls can get a few more bull trend bars, they will hold onto their longs for a swing up today. If the follow-through is bad over the next few bars, they bulls will scalp out and the bears will sell for a scalp down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It closed almost exactly in the middle of the week’s range. The bulls want a reversal up from a double bottom with the May 4 low. They then want the rally to continue up to the 200 day moving average and the 3000 Big Round Number. However, the bears want this week’s selloff to be the start of a bear leg down to 2600.<p>Traders need more information. If there are big bull days early next week, the bulls will probably reach their goal. But if there is a reversal down from a lower high, the selloff should reach 2600 in May or June.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, there is a 50% chance that it will rally to the 200 day moving average and 3,000 first.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>have been in a tight trading range for 8 weeks. They should fall to the March 18 low by this summer, but they might have a test of the March high first.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has been in a weak bear trend for 2 years. However, it has been sideways for 4 months. The odds of a bear breakout are slightly greater than for a bull breakout.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures weekly chart:</strong><br>Tight trading range after reversal down from extreme buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-tight-trading-range-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-16.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart in tight trading range after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures has been in a very tight trading range for 7 weeks. This is coming after a sharp reversal down from the most extreme buy climax in history.<p>The tight trading range represents balance and indecision. Traders are deciding if the March high will be the start of a bear trend. The alternative is the reversal down is a bull flag and the bulls will get a rally from here to a new all-time high.<h3>A tight trading range means that the bulls and bears are equally strong</h3><p>A tight trading range is a balanced market. The bond market could not be going sideways for 7 weeks if traders believed that it would ultimately break to the upside or downside.<p>Think about it. Let’s say everyone believed bonds were going higher. They would immediately buy because if they wait, they would have to pay more.<p>The reason why bonds are not going up or down is that there is no indication of the direction of the breakout. This is Breakout Mode. Traders know that there is a 50% chance of a bull breakout and a 50% chance of a bear breakout. Furthermore, they believe that there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail.<h3>Interest rates control the bond market</h3><p>The problem that the bulls face is interest rates. They are preventing a further selloff because traders think that the U.S. might join many other countries and have zero interest rates. If traders become more confident that it will happen, they will buy bonds aggressively again.<p>Remember, interest rates move in the opposite direction of bonds. Here’s a simple explanation. If you lend someone $100 and he agrees to pay you $2 interest every year, that is 2%. But if interest rates fall to 1%, then other people selling bonds that pay $2 interest will sell them for $200. You could sell your bond for $200 because of the drop in interest rates.<h3>Are we headed for zero interest rates?</h3><p>There has been a lot of discussion about this lately. Many institutional investors are betting it will happen. President Trump has said many times that he wants it to happen. He believes it would help the stock market in the short run, which would improve his chance of re-election.<p>If interest rates fall to zero, many people will look for alternative investments. An obvious one is the stock market. Most stocks pay at least a small dividend. Even Apple pays a 1% dividend. That is better than zero, plus it has the advantage of an increase in the stock price over time.<h3>America will not tolerate zero interest rates</h3><p>I have been<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\">writing for months</a>that I do not think it is possible in America. So many seniors depend on interest paying accounts. If interest rates fall to below zero, seniors have a significant reduction in the quality of their lives. This will make their families will get mad, too. They would see the government as breaking a solemn pledge to make sure that seniors can earn some passive money on their life savings.<p>If interest rates fell to below zero, you would pay a bank for the right to have a savings account. The value of your home would fall. And I believe the stock market would briefly rally, maybe into November, but it would fall as well.<p>Negative interest rates represent deflation. Everything goes down in value. Fed Chair Powell knows this and has forcefully said that he does not see it happening. He understands the risks, and he is not worried about a November election.<h2><strong>EURUSD monthly Forex chart:</strong><br>Consecutive inside bars in a bear channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-monthly-Forex-candlestick-chart-in-ioi-breakout-mode-pattern-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD monthly Forex candlestick chart in ioi breakout mode pattern\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD monthly Forex chart has been in a bear channel for 2 years. It has only closed above the 20 month EMA once since April 2018. And the close was only slightly above (December 2019).<p>It is interesting to note that the bear trend is not strong. It has not had consecutive big bear bars since it began 2 years ago. There have been several times when it has gone sideways for months months. Most of the bars largely overlap the prior several bars. The bear channel is more of a trading range that is tilted somewhat down than a strong bear trend.<p>But it is still a bear trend and it has been relentless. Traders expect lower prices.<p>There are several targets below. The 1st is the March low. March was a huge doji bar. Even though the EURUSD rallied 900 pips off the low in just 3 weeks, it is again back near the low. So far, the reversal attempt has failed.<h3>ioii Breakout Mode pattern</h3><p>The April high is below the March high and the April low is above the March low. April is therefore an inside bar. Since March was an outside bar, February was inside March’s range. That is an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern. Traders see it as neutral and therefore a Breakout Mode pattern.<p>May so far is inside of April. Consecutive inside bars is an ii pattern, which is another breakout mode pattern. The ioi is now an ioii. But there are several weeks remaining in May. It could break below the April low before the end of the month and trigger the ioi sell signal. Less likely, it could break above the April high and trigger the ioi buy signal.<p>Most breakout mode patterns are neutral. There is a 50% chance of either a bull or bear breakout. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will reverse.<h3>The Breakout Mode pattern is slightly bearish</h3><p>The current pattern in the EURUSD is not neutral. May is the 5th consecutive bear bar and all of the closes in the ioi (now, ioii) are below the moving average. Additionally, the EURUSD has been in a bear trend for 2 years. That means that there is a 55% chance of a successful bear breakout and a 45% chance of a bull breakout.<p>Why not 60%? If it was that certain, the EURUSD would already be breaking out. Why wait to sell if you believe that waiting has a 60% chance that you will have to sell at a worse price?<h3>Targets below</h3><p>If the bears trigger the monthly sell signal, the 1st target is the March low. Remember, the EURUSD reversed up violently from that price so it is important support.<p>If the EURUSD breaks below, it will probably test the next support. That is the January 2017 low. That was the start of a 2,000 pip, yearlong bull trend.<p>If the monthly chart closes below that low, the EURUSD will probably continue down to par (1.0).<p>What about a bull breakout? There are 5 consecutive bear bars and the chart is in a bear trend. Consequently, it is unlikely that the EURUSD will rally strongly from here. It would probably have to go sideways for a few bars (months) and form some bull bodies.<p>Traders want signs of buying pressure, like bars closing near their highs and far above the EMA. Without that, the upside is limited over the next several months.<h2>Covid-19 pandemic</h2><p>The U.S. now has about 1.5 million diagnosed cases of Covid-19 infections. But there are actually at least 10 million Americans currently infected.

I think their experts agree with my number.<p>The reason why they use their number instead of mine is because theirs is the only one that can be determined with certainty. They are using the number of reported confirmed cases in the US, not the actual number of infected people, which is impossible to know.<p>But they also say that only about 1% of infected people die. While it will be a couple years before we know the precise percentage who die, it will probably be between 0.5 – 2%.<p><span style=\"background-color:#ff0\">That means for every death, it is reasonable to assume that there are 100 infected people.</span>This is true even if only a small fraction of the infected people actually get tested and diagnosed.<p>Remember, the White House has said that it does not like widespread testing. They have been clear that their concern is that it would lead to a far greater number of diagnosed cases. Voters would see that as a reflection of how well the White House has handled the crisis. A bigger number would hurt its chances in November.<h3>The purpose of politicians is to help the politicians, not the people</h3><p>Most people erroneously assume that the goal of elected officials is to serve the people and do what is in the best interest of the country. That is naive and is not in the Constitution or in any state constitution.<p>The law is simple. It says that the person who gets the most votes wins. Therefore, the way our system works is that a politician’s primary job is to get re-elected by any lawful means of his choice. Some will do things that others will not, and that can help them win.<p>Many will say, “I would rather not win if I have to do something that I find morally offensive.” The candidate who understands that the primary job of any elected official is to get re-elected gets to be called “Mr. President,” “Senator,” or “Congressman.” The candidate who doesn’t understand the Constitution ends up being called “Professor.” If whatever a candidate does results in more people voting for him than for his opponent, the Constitutions says he gets to hold office.<p>If enough people feel that putting the economy ahead of saving lives is the right choice, Trump will win. If more say that lives are more important, he will lose.<p>It’s easy to get angry if you agree with one side and the other wins. But both approaches are acceptable under the Constitution and the losing side is stuck with the result. The voters get to decide.<h3>Trump found himself in an uncomfortable situation</h3><p>President Trump’s initial instincts in January and February were good. Ignore the pandemic because he would upset his base if he did what was necessary to stop it. His base is anti-government. To stop the pandemic, he would have had to do what China, South Korea, and Taiwan did. They took strong control of everyone’s lives. It is a very effective strategy, but Trump’s base would never agree to that much government interference with their personal choices.<p>His problem was that many of his science and intelligence people were telling him what I have been saying from the beginning. Coronavirus was going to infect half the country and kill a million people unless he did what China and Taiwan were doing.<h3>Trump had to wait for his base to decide</h3><p>His base listened to the experts for a couple months and then decided that the recommendations were unreasonable. It took that long for them to coalesce around an opinion. They were unwilling to follow the medical advice when there was no guarantee that there would ever be a vaccine. They concluded that it was better to risk getting infected than have the economy die.<p>Trump was torn. Stick with his base or follow the experts. After a couple months of hearing the public clamor for him to listen to the experts, he began to take some of their advice. He could not take all of it without angering his base. Unfortunately, taking only half of it was no better than taking none. Both results in half the country getting infected.<p>He concluded that he has to do what his base wants if he is to get re-elected. They want to return to the lives they had before the pandemic, even at the risk of dying. The result is that half the country will get infected, a million people will die, and several million people will have permanent lung and kidney damage. But we live in a democracy and if enough people want that choice, that is what we get. Fair enough.<h3>Trump is now at peace</h3><p>President Trump came to understand this a few weeks ago and he has decided to do what his base wants. Re-open the country, tell people to be careful, accept whatever deaths result, and then insist that many more would have died if he did not do all that he did. At the same time, be very respectful of Drs. Fauci and Birx. Claim to be doing what they are recommending, but actually ignore them and push ahead in opening the economy.<p>Politicians have to make tough decisions and it often takes months for them to become comfortable with a strategy. Trump is there now. Half the country would prefer that he chose Taiwan’s approach, but that half did not vote for him. He made a rational decision, given that half the country would be mad about whichever choice he selected.<h3>My minimum expectation since February is still 500,000 U.S. deaths</h3><p>Data from Johns Hopkins shows that the U.S. will have around 100,000 U.S. deaths by the end of May. With a death rate of 1%, that means there must be 100,000 x 100 = 10 million infected people in the U.S. If the actual death rate is 0.5%, then there are now 20 million infected Americans. With about 2,000 deaths a day, there are 200,000 more infected people every day. I still believe that 100 – 200 million Americans will get infected.<p>Since each infected person infects 2 – 3 additional people during the 2 weeks they are contagious, this number will grow… and grow and grow. The growth will continue until there is a vaccine.<p>If the vaccine comes in January, that is more than 200 days away. If 2,000 people die a day, there will be 400,000 more deaths before there is a vaccine, putting the total at 500,000.<p>That has been my minimum expectation since my weekend report of February 29 when there was only one American who died from the coronavirus. I still believe that 500,000 to 2 million Americans will die in this pandemic.<p>Even after there is a vaccine, millions more Americans will get infected because maybe only 50 – 70% will get vaccinated and that will take many months. Why isn’t the media reporting this? They are continuing to under-report and miss the story.<h3>Everyone knows that all governments lie</h3><p>It is to any government’s advantage to minimize the number of deaths attributed to any problem they are trying to fight. This is true for a war, a hurricane, an earthquake, or a pandemic.<p>Notice that I said “attributed to.” That means that many governments around the world lie about the true number of deaths. This is especially true of dictatorships and authoritarian regimes where they control the information and the press.<p>The U.S. cannot lie about the actual number because the medical community is constantly releasing the updated data. And the press will report it as it comes out.<h3>Intentionally misleading forecasts</h3><p>All along the way, our government has continued to use forecasts that extend out only a month or two. It then tries to mislead the public into assuming that the forecast is for the final count once the pandemic has ended. That is not the case. Americans will continue to die from Covid-19 at least until the end of 2021, even if there is a vaccine in January.<p>The government sees us as frogs in a pot of water. They are slowly turning up the heat so we won’t jump out of the pot. They are slowly turning up the projections so that we will not be outraged by the 500,000 – 2 million deaths that will be the result of our disastrous response to the crisis.<h3>We have no interest in being the world’s leader in the pandemic</h3><p>Americans 1st reaction to any problem is that we should always be the world’s leader in everything. We should at least be comparable to Germany, Taiwan, South Korea, and many other nations. But after a few months, a large number of Americans have concluded that we should essentially let the virus go. This is true even though it will result in a percentage of deaths comparable to that in developing nations. We have chosen the economy over life.<p>As I have been saying, I do not see leadership coming from either political party in Washington. When a problem is as big as this is, everyone in Washington should be doing so much more.<p>The number dead will surpass the total number of dead in every war and every national disaster since the founding of our country. Do the politicians care? Maybe, but clearly not enough.<p>Their lack of decisive action shows that they accept that the number of dead Americans will be huge. They accept it because they sense that is what the majority of Americans have resigned themselves to this outcome. Also, big numbers are all the same. Politicians understand one of the tenants of Stalinism, which says, “When one dies, it’s a tragedy. When a million die, it’s a statistic.”<h3>So why is the stock market rallying if 20% of the country is unemployed?</h3><p>The pandemic will lead to unemployment comparable to the Great Depression that started in 1929. The stock market fell almost 90% from its peak in the 1930’s. Why is the market rallying so strongly now when the unemployment and GDP now is the worst since the Great Depression?<p>One reason is that we now have a great Fed. They are very smart, bold people who have learned from the past. The Fed Governors have said that they will effectively create infinite dollars to prevent the destruction of the economy. Investors see that as the Fed putting a floor under the market.<p>I think everyone is getting this wrong. The market is down only 10 – 20%. But I wrote several weeks ago that the Fed’s floor will be around 50-60% down from the high. There have been many selloffs in that range since the Depression and we completely recovered each time. I therefore think that the Fed’s real floor will be about 50 – 60% down from the high. The market is up in part simply because investors believe there is a floor somewhere.<p>We live in a country with a relatively free market. The Fed wants it to stay that way. They therefore will not intervene as quickly as many investors hope.<p>Traders who are buying at the current price think they are buying just above the Fed’s floor. They are not. The floor is far below and these traders will discover that the support that they expected is not where they assumed it will be.<h3>The rally is technical</h3><p>So why is the market rallying so strongly? There is obviously the euphoria that the pandemic is not going to be as bad as the bubonic plague in Europe in the 1300’s. Also, institutions love what the Fed is doing.<p>These are both necessary for the rally, but the sine qua non is the technical pattern on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. It is easiest to see on the daily chart.<p>The selloff on the daily chart was a Spike and Parabolic wedge bear channel. That channel began with the pullback to the March 3 high.<p>When there is a reversal up from a Spike and Channel sell climax, no matter how strong the selloff is, the rally typically tests to around the start of the channel. The market is simply repeating a behavior that he has done thousands of times on all time-frames. It is no more complicated than that. Experienced chart readers know that, and they are trading with that expectation.<p>The stock market probably would not be able to do it as strongly as it has without the good news about the pandemic and the Fed. However, I have talked about this many times over the past 2 months. That technical pattern is simply unfolding as it usually does.<p>The market is now near the March 3 high. Traders should soon expect a test back down, and then a trading range. That range will be a continuation of the 2 1/2 year trading range and it will probably last all year.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>High 1 bull flag, but 2 1/2 year trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-ii-bull-flag-after-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has ii bull flag after sell climax\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a big bull inside bar closing on its in April. This is after a 2 bar pullback in February and March. May is currently also an inside bar. If May remains within April’s range, there will be an ii (inside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern.<p>April is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar in a 12 year bull trend. If a trader only looks at the monthly chart, he sees a good buy setup. Traders want to know what is above the April high.<p>The bulls know that the 2 big bear bars make a 2nd leg sideways to down likely. However, April was such a strong reversal, traders know that the odds favor at least a little follow-through buying in May.<p>The bulls want to trigger the buy signal. There is enough room above the April high and below the February high for them to make a reasonable profit. They therefore have bought both 3 day pullbacks in May, even though this week’s selloff was strong.<h3>Where will the bears sell?</h3><p>What about the bears? They would like to prevent the buy signal from triggering. Therefore, they sold this week just below the April high. If they can keep May within the April’s range and have May close near its low, May could be the start of the 2nd leg down from the high.<p>Will the bears sell just above the April high? They might because there is resistance on the daily chart just above the April high at the 200 day moving average.<p>More likely, if they are unable to stop the buy signal from triggering, many will buy back their shorts. That would probably lead to at least several days of higher prices. The rally would probably go about 50 points above the April high before the bears will try again to get their 2nd leg down.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>2nd reversal at the 20 week EMA</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-stalling-at-20-week-EMA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-16-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart stalling at 20 week EMA\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed down from the 20 week EMA 2 weeks ago. At the time, I said that the reversal would probably last only 2 – 3 weeks because it was coming after a 6 bar bull micro channel.<p>That is a sign of very aggressive bulls. For 6 weeks, they bought above the low of the prior week. The pullback was mostly sideways and it lasted only 2 weeks.<p>The bulls triggered a High 1 buy signal this week by going above last week’s high. However, it immediately sold off. The Emini then traded below last week’s low after reversing down from above last week’s high. This week therefore was an outside down week.<p>There are now consecutive reversals down from the 20 week EMA. But the week closed in the middle of its range. The bears were unable to get the week to close below last week’s low and at the low of the week. This week therefore was neutral.<h3>Is the 6 week bull trend resuming?</h3><p>Traders are still deciding if the rally up from the V bottom will continue higher or reverse down from the 20 week EMA. It might take a few more weeks to become clear.<p>If next week goes above last week’s high, but then reverses down, there would be a 6 week micro wedge top. That could lead to a reversal down for several weeks.<p>The rally has been exceptionally strong. A tight bull channel does not typically immediately reverse into a bear trend. Consequently, even if the bears get a selloff to below 2600 in May or June, the bulls will buy it. They expect at least a small 2nd leg up after a very strong rally.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Is the 200 day moving average a strong enough magnet?</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-chart-double-bottom-double-top-breakout-mode.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-16-4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed down from a wedge top on April 29. But the 6 week bull channel was tight. That made the 1st leg down likely to be minor.<p>The Emini rallied back to the April high this week. When there is a wedge top and the bull channel is tight, there is a 50% chance of a rally to above the wedge before there is a bear trend. The bulls tried early this week and failed. They have been trying again on Thursday and Friday.<p>The bears want the 2 day rally to reverse down from below the May high. There would then be a 2nd lower high. That would increase the talk of a possible early bear trend.<p>Even though the daily chart has been sideways for a month, traders know that it is overbought. They expect a 10 – 20% pullback to begin in May or June. Traders are deciding if it has already begun or if there will be one more leg up first.<h3>Legs in trading ranges usually go beyond major support and resistance</h3><p>Support and resistance are magnets. Like all magnets, when you get near, the magnetic force increases. It is hard to avoid getting pulled to the magnet.<p>The 200 day moving average is widely followed by institutional traders. It therefore is an important magnet. The Emini was nearby on Tuesday. It might have been near enough so that it cannot go down without first testing at least a little above it.<p>But to go above it, the Emini would also have to rally above the April high. That is the top of the wedge. Theoretically, the bears will get stopped out above that high.<p>Some bears will exit, but others will be looking to sell around the 200 day moving average. They are betting that the March reversal will not make a new all-time high without at least a 50% pullback first. They currently have a 70% chance of being right.<h3>The March parabolic wedge sell climax began on March 3</h3><p>A strong break above the March high will lead to a test of the March 3rd high. That was the start of the March parabolic wedge selloff.<p>I have been saying since the March low that the March 3rd high was a potential target. The Emini is close enough so that it will probably get near it at some point this year. What we do not yet know is if the current rally will continue up there or if there will be a reversal down to 2600 1st.<h3>The importance of 2600</h3><p>The bulls are hoping that the reversal up from the V bottom will be like last year’s bull reversal and lead to a new high this year. They have only a 30% chance after the 35% selloff. Therefore, traders expect a pullback before then.<p>If there is a deep pullback, traders will conclude that the April rally was a bull leg in the 2 1/2 year trading range. Trading ranges typically disappoint traders hoping that a leg will grow into a trend. The legs up and down usually go beyond important support and resistance before reversing.<p>For example, if the rally breaks above the 200 day moving average this month, there will probably be a reversal down. That would disappoint the bulls.<h3>The March 31 high is an important breakout point</h3><p>The Emini broke strongly above the March 31 high in April. The April 21 pullback did not overlap the breakout point. There is a gap between the March 31 high and the April 21 low. That is a sign of strong bulls.<p>But I believe that the rally is really just a bull leg in a trading range. If so, there should be a reversal down that closes that gap and disappoints the bulls.<p>That March 31 high is 2629.50. If the Emini falls below it, the selloff will probably test the next nearby support. That is the 2600 Big Round Number.<p>To get there, the Emini would have to fall below 2706.00. Why is that important? Because it is 20% down from the all-time high. If the Emini drops below it, the news will be that despite the huge rally, the Emini was back in bear market territory.<h3>The coming week</h3><p>The Emini has been sideways for a month. Traders know that they will not get a new high this year. But they do not know where this current rally will end. It might have ended with the April wedge top. However, if there is another leg up, it will probably fail around the 200 day moving average and the 3,000 Big Round Number.<p>The month-long trading range means that the bulls and bears are balanced. There is a 50% chance of one more leg up to the 200 day moving average before a move down to 2600. There is also a 50% chance that the move is already underway.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders are wondering if the selloff is the start of a move down to 2600.<p>However, the bulls see Thursday as the buy signal bar for a High 2 bull flag. There is a lower low double bottom with the May 4 low.<p>When a market is in a bull trend, it resists reversing. This is especially true when the high is near major resistance. It usually has to touch that resistance before there is a reversal down.<p>The top of the 2 month rally is near the 100, 150 and 200 day moving averages. All are important resistance. Traders are still wondering if the bull trend has to reach those magnets before the bulls will take profits and the bears will short.<p>Since the Emini has been sideways for 3 weeks, the odds have been 50-50. Traders need more information. If today or tomorrow are strong bull days, the rally will probably continue up to the moving averages and the 3,000 Big Round Number before reversing. Otherwise, it should form a small lower high and reverse down to 2600 in May or June.<h3>Breakout Mode</h3><p>The bears want this week to stay below last week’s high. If it does, this week will be an inside bar on the weekly chart. Since last week was an outside bar, there would be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern on the weekly chart. That would not change things because traders already see it a being in Breakout Mode.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 80 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap far above Friday’s high. It might even gap above last week’s high.<p>When there is a big gap up, there is an increased chance of a trend day. Up is slightly more likely than down.<p>However, the Emini will open far above the average price (the 20 day EMA). Traders will not pay a price that is far above average unless they are buying bars that are far above average. The bulls want to see a couple big bull bars closing near their highs within the first 5 bars. If they get that, day traders will begin to buy, even though they would be paying far above the average price.<p>The bears see a price far above average as a good price to sell. But want some evidence that the price is being rejected as too high. Day traders will sell if there are one or two big bear bars closing near their lows on the open or within the 1st few bars.<p>Most often, whether there are strong bull or bear bars on the open, a big gap up leads to a trading range open. That means 2 or more reversals in the 1st hour or two. If that happens, the bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom near the 20 bar EMA. Also, the bears will look for a double top or a wedge rally to sell for a swing down.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-18.png\" alt=\"emini weak bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-bottom-and-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-18-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex head and shoulders bottom and bear flag\"></a></figure><p>Traders are deciding if the EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart will rally from a head and shoulders bottom or sell off from a double top bear flag. If the bulls can get a close above the May 13 high, traders will expect a move up to the May high. After that, they will try to continue the rally up to the March high.<p>But if the bears get a close below the May 7 low, traders will conclude that the bottom has failed. They will then look for a break below the March low and possibly a move down to par (1.0).<p>A small bear bar today or tomorrow would convert the 2 week trading range into a triangle. But that would not change anything because the chart already is in Breakout Mode. A bull day today or tomorrow would make an upside breakout slightly more likely.<p>With the bull bars near the bottom of a 2 month trading range, the daily chart looks slightly more likely to go up. However, the monthly chart is in a 2 year bear channel (I showed it over the weekend). It therefore is slightly more likely to have a bear breakout.<p>This is a neutral market. Traders are taking quick profits, but expect a 200+ pip move up or down to begin within the next few weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied 40 pips from Friday’s close. Friday was a bull day. The bulls would like the overnight rally to grow into a big bull trend day.<p>However, so far, the bars are small. Furthermore, most days over the past 2 weeks have been small. At a minimum, the bulls want today to close near its high. That would be a 2nd consecutive bull bar on the daily chart. It would slightly increase the chance of a breakout above last week’s high later this week.<p>The bears always want the opposite. They would like today to close near its low. It would then be another sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>However, the overnight rally has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That reduces the chance of a reversal down today. Furthermore, day traders are not going to sell until the see one or more 20 – 30 pip pullbacks today. Without that, it will be very difficult from them to make money shorting.<p>Because the rally has small bull bars and most days over the past 2 weeks have been small, day traders do not expect today’s range to become much bigger. They will continue to buy unless there is a surprisingly strong reversal down. If the small overnight rally stalls and evolves into a trading range, day traders will also sell rallies, looking for 10 pip scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bull-trend-and-monthly-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend and monthly High 1 bull flag buy signal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Traders are wondering if the selloff is the start of a move down to 2600.<p>However, the bulls see Thursday as the buy signal bar for a High 2 bull flag. There is a lower low double bottom with the May 4 low.<p>When a market is in a bull trend, it resists reversing. This is especially true when the high is near major resistance. It usually has to touch that resistance before there is a reversal down.<p>The top of the 2 month rally is near the 100, 150 and 200 day moving averages. All are important resistance. Traders are still wondering if the bull trend has to reach those magnets before the bulls will take profits and the bears will short.<p>Since the Emini has been sideways for 3 weeks, the odds have been 50-50. Traders need more information. If today or tomorrow are strong bull days, the rally will probably continue up to the moving averages and the 3,000 Big Round Number before reversing. Otherwise, it should form a small lower high and reverse down to 2600 in May or June.<h3>Breakout Mode</h3><p>The bears want this week to stay below last week’s high. If it does, this week will be an inside bar on the weekly chart. Since last week was an outside bar, there would be an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern on the weekly chart. That would not change things because traders already see it a being in Breakout Mode.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 80 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap far above Friday’s high. It might even gap above last week’s high.<p>When there is a big gap up, there is an increased chance of a trend day. Up is slightly more likely than down.<p>However, the Emini will open far above the average price (the 20 day EMA). Traders will not pay a price that is far above average unless they are buying bars that are far above average. The bulls want to see a couple big bull bars closing near their highs within the first 5 bars. If they get that, day traders will begin to buy, even though they would be paying far above the average price.<p>The bears see a price far above average as a good price to sell. But want some evidence that the price is being rejected as too high. Day traders will sell if there are one or two big bear bars closing near their lows on the open or within the 1st few bars.<p>Most often, whether there are strong bull or bear bars on the open, a big gap up leads to a trading range open. That means 2 or more reversals in the 1st hour or two. If that happens, the bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom near the 20 bar EMA. Also, the bears will look for a double top or a wedge rally to sell for a swing down.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-18.png\" alt=\"emini weak bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If the bulls can get a close above the May 13 high, traders will expect a move up to the May high. After that, they will try to continue the rally up to the March high.<p>But if the bears get a close below the May 7 low, traders will conclude that the bottom has failed. They will then look for a break below the March low and possibly a move down to par (1.0).<p>A small bear bar today or tomorrow would convert the 2 week trading range into a triangle. But that would not change anything because the chart already is in Breakout Mode. A bull day today or tomorrow would make an upside breakout slightly more likely.<p>With the bull bars near the bottom of a 2 month trading range, the daily chart looks slightly more likely to go up. However, the monthly chart is in a 2 year bear channel (I showed it over the weekend). It therefore is slightly more likely to have a bear breakout.<p>This is a neutral market. Traders are taking quick profits, but expect a 200+ pip move up or down to begin within the next few weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied 40 pips from Friday’s close. Friday was a bull day. The bulls would like the overnight rally to grow into a big bull trend day.<p>However, so far, the bars are small. Furthermore, most days over the past 2 weeks have been small. At a minimum, the bulls want today to close near its high. That would be a 2nd consecutive bull bar on the daily chart. It would slightly increase the chance of a breakout above last week’s high later this week.<p>The bears always want the opposite. They would like today to close near its low. It would then be another sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>However, the overnight rally has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That reduces the chance of a reversal down today. Furthermore, day traders are not going to sell until the see one or more 20 – 30 pip pullbacks today. Without that, it will be very difficult from them to make money shorting.<p>Because the rally has small bull bars and most days over the past 2 weeks have been small, day traders do not expect today’s range to become much bigger. They will continue to buy unless there is a surprisingly strong reversal down. If the small overnight rally stalls and evolves into a trading range, day traders will also sell rallies, looking for 10 pip scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bull-trend-and-monthly-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend and monthly High 1 bull flag buy signal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This also theoretically stopped out the bears who shorted the wedge top on the daily chart.<p>It closed back at the April high, where it spend much of yesterday. After a big gap up, the Emini often goes sideways for a day or two before resuming up to the next target.<p>I have mentioned the 200 day moving average many times. The rally should get there this week. It could get there today. That is also around the 3,000 Big Round Number.<p>The minimum goal is to reach the 200 day moving average, which is around the 3,000 Big Round Number. The bulls want the rally to continue to the March 3 high. That was the start of the parabolic wedge sell climax on the daily chart. Also, it is at a measured move up from the month-long trading range.<p>Because the 2 bears bars on the monthly chart were huge, this rally will probably have a 2nd leg sideways to down before there is a new all-time high. That leg down should begin within a few weeks. The sell zone is between 3,000 and 3,100, which is around the March 3 high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 4 points in the Globex session. Yesterday’s late selloff was a bear Surprise Breakout. A bear surprise typically has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. Also, Big Up, Big Down creates Big Confusion. Since confusion is a hallmark of a trading range, traders expect sideways trading today.<p>The bears want that selloff to be a spike down in a new bear trend on the daily chart. They then hope that today will be the start of a channel down for the next several days. If they get that, traders will conclude that yesterday’s breakout above the April high failed.<p>However, what is more likely is that the selloff will simply be the start of a 1 – 3 day sideways to down pullback from triggering the monthly buy signal. There is a 55% chance that this rally will reach the measured move target at the March 3 high before there is more than a 3 – 5 day pullback<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bull-trend-and-monthly-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-19.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend and monthly High 1 bull flag buy signal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But while yesterday increases the chance of a bull breakout, until there is a breakout, there is no breakout.<p>Traders know that the probability is cannot be more than 55% for either the bulls or the bears until there is a clear breakout. They want to see a close far above or below the range. If a breakout has consecutive closes, it is more likely to be successful.<p>Once there is a breakout up or down, traders will look for a move that is approximately as big as the trading range is tall. Because the range is 300 pips tall, traders would look for a measured move up from a bull breakout to reach around 1.13. That is still far below the March 9 high, which is the top of the 8 month trading range.<p>Since the daily chart is still in a trading range, the bears always have a reasonable argument. They would like a reversal down from around the top of the range. If it comes from a lower high, they will see the week-long rally as a pullback from the reversal down from the April/May double top. If it comes from above the May high, they would then see the reversal as simply a failed breakout above the trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had some overnight follow-through buying after yesterday’s bull trend. However, it has sold off 30 pips over the past 2 hours.<p>Since the selloff has been in a tight bear channel, it is strong. That relentless profit-taking by the bulls reduces the chance of a strong bull trend today.<p>Can today continue down? The bear bars have been small and yesterday was strongly bullish. That combination makes a much bigger selloff unlikely.<p>If it will not go up or down much today, traders are left with a trading range. They will look for 10 – 20 pip scalps up and down.<p>The bulls would like the day to close near its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow. It would also increase the chance of a break above the range within a week.<p>If today closes on the low and there is a bear body on the daily chart, traders will expect at least slightly lower prices tomorrow. But yesterday was surprisingly big. A bull surprise bar on the daily chart typically has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. Therefore, the downside over the next few days is not big.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-failed-breakout-above-April-high-1-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini failed breakout above April high 1 buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, the Emini spent much of the rest of the day in a trading range around the April high. It collapsed to below yesterday’s low into the close.<p>Today is a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a failed breakout above the month-long trading range and the April high. The daily chart is overbought and traders expect about a 3 week pullback in June. The bears hope it began today.<p>But yesterday’s strong rally and the break above the wedge on the daily chart make it slightly more likely that a reversal down will last only a day or two. This is especially true because the March 3 high and the 200 day moving average are important magnets above. However, there will probably be a pullback for several weeks beginning around the April high or the 200 day moving average.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But while yesterday increases the chance of a bull breakout, until there is a breakout, there is no breakout.<p>Traders know that the probability is cannot be more than 55% for either the bulls or the bears until there is a clear breakout. They want to see a close far above or below the range. If a breakout has consecutive closes, it is more likely to be successful.<p>Once there is a breakout up or down, traders will look for a move that is approximately as big as the trading range is tall. Because the range is 300 pips tall, traders would look for a measured move up from a bull breakout to reach around 1.13. That is still far below the March 9 high, which is the top of the 8 month trading range.<p>Since the daily chart is still in a trading range, the bears always have a reasonable argument. They would like a reversal down from around the top of the range. If it comes from a lower high, they will see the week-long rally as a pullback from the reversal down from the April/May double top. If it comes from above the May high, they would then see the reversal as simply a failed breakout above the trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had some overnight follow-through buying after yesterday’s bull trend. However, it has sold off 30 pips over the past 2 hours.<p>Since the selloff has been in a tight bear channel, it is strong. That relentless profit-taking by the bulls reduces the chance of a strong bull trend today.<p>Can today continue down? The bear bars have been small and yesterday was strongly bullish. That combination makes a much bigger selloff unlikely.<p>If it will not go up or down much today, traders are left with a trading range. They will look for 10 – 20 pip scalps up and down.<p>The bulls would like the day to close near its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow. It would also increase the chance of a break above the range within a week.<p>If today closes on the low and there is a bear body on the daily chart, traders will expect at least slightly lower prices tomorrow. But yesterday was surprisingly big. A bull surprise bar on the daily chart typically has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. Therefore, the downside over the next few days is not big.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-failed-breakout-above-April-high-1-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini failed breakout above April high 1 buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, the Emini spent much of the rest of the day in a trading range around the April high. It collapsed to below yesterday’s low into the close.<p>Today is a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a failed breakout above the month-long trading range and the April high. The daily chart is overbought and traders expect about a 3 week pullback in June. The bears hope it began today.<p>But yesterday’s strong rally and the break above the wedge on the daily chart make it slightly more likely that a reversal down will last only a day or two. This is especially true because the March 3 high and the 200 day moving average are important magnets above. However, there will probably be a pullback for several weeks beginning around the April high or the 200 day moving average.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is therefore a sell signal bar for a failed breakout above the month-long trading range.<p>However, Monday’s rally was strong and it triggered buy signals on the daily and monthly chart. In addition, the March 3 lower high and the 200 day moving average are important magnets above. A measured move up based on the month-long trading range is almost exactly at the March 3 high.<p>It is therefore more likely that yesterday is just part of a 2 – 5 day pause after breaking above major resistance. Traders still expect a test of the 200 day moving average and the March 3 lower high within the next couple of weeks. At that point, they will look for about a 10% pullback for a few weeks.<p>But if today is a surprisingly big bear day or if there are several consecutive bear days, traders will conclude that the break above the April high has failed. They will then look for a selloff for several weeks to the bottom of the month-long trading range and possibly 2600.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 37 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap far above yesterday’s close and it will have undone much of the last selloff.<p>That selloff was a Bear Spike and Parabolic Wedge Bear Trend. Traders expect a test of the start of the channel. Then, there is typically a trading range. This is similar to the pattern on the daily chart.<p>Today will open around the start of the channel (the top of yesterday’s climactic final leg down). Consequently, there is an increased chance of an early trading range. This is especially true since it will open within yesterday’s trading range.<p>Traders believe that the breakout above the April high will be successful. That makes them look to buy strong selloffs,like yesterday. They are betting that the selloffs are more likely pullbacks in a bull trend on the daily chart than the start of a bear trend. That increases the size and number of rallies on the 5 minute chart.<p>Even though today will probably have a trading range open, the Emini is working up to 3100. There is therefore an increased chance of bull trend days.<p>But if the bears get a 2nd big bear day today, traders will begin to believe that the breakout above the month-long trading range will fail.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-failed-breakout-above-April-high-1-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-20.png\" alt=\"Emini failed breakout above April high 1 buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Since it is still in the trading range, it is still in Breakout Mode.<p>The last time one side was in control was during the rally to the March 27 high. That makes a bull breakout slightly more likely than a bear breakout. But it is important to remember that until there is a breakout, there is no breakout and reversals are still more likely.<p>At a minimum, the bulls need a close above the May 1 high. If the close is far above and the breakout bar is big and it closes on its high, that will increase the chance of a successful breakout. Consecutive bull bars and consecutive closes above that high would make traders expect a test of the March 27 buy climax high or even the March 9 high.<p>But if there is a bear bar closing near its low this week, especially a big bear bar, traders will look for a move back to the bottom of the range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has had a small overnight rally with small bars. Also, the low was above yesterday’s low and the high so far is below yesterday’s high. Today is currently an inside bar.<p>Even though the EURUSD is up 30 pips, the range is small. Also, yesterday reversed down. This lack of energy at the top of the 2 month trading range reduces the chance that the 2 week rally is the start of a bull trend.<p>But because the chart is at important resistance, day traders will be ready for either a strong breakout or a strong reversal. Given the price action of the past 2 days, they expect quiet trading. Day traders have been scalping for 10 pips while they wait for the next strong move up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-buy-climax-and-final-bull-flag-then-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax and final bull flag then trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Since Tuesday was a bear bar, it was a weak buy setup. However, traders still expect the rally to reach the 200 moving average just above yesterday’s high soon.<p>For the bears, yesterday is a sell signal bar for a 2nd failed breakout above the April high. But it and Monday had bull bodies They are weak sell signal bars in a bull trend. There will probably be more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low if the Emini gets there today.<p>Remember, I have been saying since Monday that a breakout above major resistance typically leads to several sideways bar. I also said that the Emini will probably continue up to at least a little above the 200 day moving average, which is now at 2989. If it closes above it, the rally should test the March 3 lower high before there is a 10% pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 8 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably open within yesterday’s range.<p>It is only 28 points below the 200 day moving average. Traders expect it to get there today or tomorrow. Will it need a strong trend to get there? No, because the target is so close. Can the Emini reverse strongly down from here without reaching the target? The bears have a 40% chance.<p>Day traders expect the Emini to work higher, but there is no compelling reason to expect a strong trend up or down. Most days have had swings up and down. That is what day traders will expect today.

Since Tuesday was a bear bar, it was a weak buy setup. However, traders still expect the rally to reach the 200 moving average just above yesterday’s high soon.<p>For the bears, yesterday is a sell signal bar for a 2nd failed breakout above the April high. But it and Monday had bull bodies They are weak sell signal bars in a bull trend. There will probably be more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low if the Emini gets there today.<p>Remember, I have been saying since Monday that a breakout above major resistance typically leads to several sideways bar. I also said that the Emini will probably continue up to at least a little above the 200 day moving average, which is now at 2989. If it closes above it, the rally should test the March 3 lower high before there is a 10% pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 8 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably open within yesterday’s range.<p>It is only 28 points below the 200 day moving average. Traders expect it to get there today or tomorrow. Will it need a strong trend to get there? No, because the target is so close. Can the Emini reverse strongly down from here without reaching the target? The bears have a 40% chance.<p>Day traders expect the Emini to work higher, but there is no compelling reason to expect a strong trend up or down. Most days have had swings up and down. That is what day traders will expect today. Also, since today will probably open within yesterday’s range, day traders expect a trading range open for the 1st hour or two.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-buy-climax-and-final-bull-flag-then-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-21.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax and final bull flag then trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It might stay around the April high through the end of the month.<p>The bulls want May to close far above the April high. Traders would then expect higher prices in June. The bears want May to close at or below the April high. That would increase the chance of sideways to down prices for a month or so.<p>Traders are deciding if the monthly buy signal will lead to a strong rally on the monthly chart. Probably not. There will be sellers above the 200 day moving average and around the March 3 lower high. That sell zone is 3,000 – 3,100. The 2 month rally will probably exhaust itself there. Traders should then expect about a 50% retracement.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session after selling off 30 points early in the session. Today will open near the April high, which is where it has been every day this week.<p>With every day having a lot of trading range price action, day traders will expect that again today. However, every day has also had at least a small swing up and down.<p>Today is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important. At a minimum, the bulls want a bull body on the weekly chart.

That would encourage the bulls because it would continue to make a move up to the 200 day moving average likely.<p>The bears want the opposite.

That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-22.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The May 1 high is also the neckline of a head and shoulders bottom. Traders are deciding if the breakout attempt will succeed or fail. Is today a pullback in an early bull trend or is it the start of a leg down in the trading range?<p>With just 2 unremarkable bear bars above the EMA, this is more likely a pullback. But legs up and down in trading ranges routinely disappoint traders. The odds are only slightly better than 50 – 50. If today or Monday closes on its low and below the EMA, then traders will conclude that the daily chart is back to neutral. It could even be slightly bearish if either day was a huge bear day.<h3>Weekly support and resistance are important on Fridays</h3><p>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance are important. On the weekly chart, there is a micro double bottom. This week triggered the buy signal by going above last week’s high.<p>However, the 2 day selloff has the EMA back in the middle of the week’s range and exactly at last week’s high. If the bulls can get a close above both of those prices, it would increase the chance of sideways to up trading next week. If they fail, traders will look for sideways to down trading next week.<p>The most important point is that the daily chart is in a 2 month trading range. Most breakout attempts fail. Traders expect reversals until there is a clear breakout above or below the range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight until 2 hours ago. But like trends this month, it lacked consecutive big bear bars. There was not much energy.<p>It reversed up from a wedge bottom 2 hours ago and it now has been in a trading range for 4 hours. Day traders have switched to scalping up and down.<p>The bulls hope for a higher low and then a bull trend reversal. If they can get today to close above the open, today would be a credible buy signal bar on the daily chart. There would be a High 1 bull flag. That would increase the chance of another attempt to break above the trading range next week.<p>Can today become a big bear day? Unlikely. The selloff in the Asian and European sessions was not strong. The 2 hour reversal up has been strong enough to make traders expect a trading range or a rally back to the open.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-lower-low-and-then-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low and then higher low major trend reversal \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a reversal up from a higher low major trend reversal at the open of the week. The market was drawn up to the Globex high at the end of the day. It also was pulled up to the April high, where it spent the entire week.<p>Today and the week had bull bodies and the 200 day SMA is a magnet above. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>Today is also a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the daily chart. But it had only a small bull body and it followed a big bear bar yesterday. In addition, there is a 5 day tight trading range. This is not a strong buy signal, even though the Emini should go at least a little higher next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The May 1 high is also the neckline of a head and shoulders bottom. Traders are deciding if the breakout attempt will succeed or fail. Is today a pullback in an early bull trend or is it the start of a leg down in the trading range?<p>With just 2 unremarkable bear bars above the EMA, this is more likely a pullback. But legs up and down in trading ranges routinely disappoint traders. The odds are only slightly better than 50 – 50. If today or Monday closes on its low and below the EMA, then traders will conclude that the daily chart is back to neutral. It could even be slightly bearish if either day was a huge bear day.<h3>Weekly support and resistance are important on Fridays</h3><p>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance are important. On the weekly chart, there is a micro double bottom. This week triggered the buy signal by going above last week’s high.<p>However, the 2 day selloff has the EMA back in the middle of the week’s range and exactly at last week’s high. If the bulls can get a close above both of those prices, it would increase the chance of sideways to up trading next week. If they fail, traders will look for sideways to down trading next week.<p>The most important point is that the daily chart is in a 2 month trading range. Most breakout attempts fail. Traders expect reversals until there is a clear breakout above or below the range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight until 2 hours ago. But like trends this month, it lacked consecutive big bear bars. There was not much energy.<p>It reversed up from a wedge bottom 2 hours ago and it now has been in a trading range for 4 hours. Day traders have switched to scalping up and down.<p>The bulls hope for a higher low and then a bull trend reversal. If they can get today to close above the open, today would be a credible buy signal bar on the daily chart. There would be a High 1 bull flag. That would increase the chance of another attempt to break above the trading range next week.<p>Can today become a big bear day? Unlikely. The selloff in the Asian and European sessions was not strong. The 2 hour reversal up has been strong enough to make traders expect a trading range or a rally back to the open.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-lower-low-and-then-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low and then higher low major trend reversal \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a reversal up from a higher low major trend reversal at the open of the week. The market was drawn up to the Globex high at the end of the day. It also was pulled up to the April high, where it spent the entire week.<p>Today and the week had bull bodies and the 200 day SMA is a magnet above. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>Today is also a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the daily chart. But it had only a small bull body and it followed a big bear bar yesterday. In addition, there is a 5 day tight trading range. This is not a strong buy signal, even though the Emini should go at least a little higher next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It will likely be mostly sideways in a tight range for several more months.<p>The monthly<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex chart has an ioii Breakout Mode pattern. Since it has been unable to get above the 20 month EMA for 2 years, there is a slightly higher probability of a bear breakout.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures monthly chart:</strong><br>ii Breakout Mode pattern after extreme buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bond-Futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-ii-breakout-mode-pattern-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-23.png\" alt=\"Bond Futures monthly candlestick chart has ii breakout mode pattern after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures market had the biggest 3 month rally in the history of the market early this year. It was therefore unsustainable and climactic.<p>The bond market sold off strong at the end of March. March then closed in the middle of its range. April’s high was below the March high and April’s low was above the March low. April was an inside month.<p>May so far is within April’s range. This is therefore an ii (inside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. That means that the chance of a bull breakout is about the same as for a bear breakout.<p>With the very small ranges for 2 months, there is not much energy in the bond market. That reduces the chance of a strong breakout coming within the next few months. If there is a breakout, it will likely lead to more sideways bars than to a trend.<h3>Limited upside after extreme buy climax</h3><p>Since the ii Breakout Mode pattern is coming immediately after an extreme buy climax, the bulls are not eager to buy. After extreme profit-taking like this, they typically want to wait for about 10 bars (here, months) before they will try to resume the trend.<p>The bulls want to be sure that the bears cannot begin a trend reversal down. If the bears make 2 attempts down and fail, the bulls will start to buy. But two attempts typically take about 10 bars, which is about a year.<p>Any buying before then is usually for a trade. They will take quick profits. Consequently, the upside over the next few months is not great.<h3>What are the targets for the bears?</h3><p>But what about the downside? There is a 70% chance of a test of the January low before there is a break above the March high. When there is a reversal down from a buy climax, the 1st target is the bottom of the buy climax. That usually is also around the 20 month EMA. But with the loss of momentum, the bond market might take all year to get down to that January low.<p>Also, I have said many times that the<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">U.S. will not have negative interest rates</a>, despite what President Trump wants. Therefore, the odds are against the bond market every going much above the March high. It may never get above that high.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex monthly chart:</strong><br>ioii Breakout Mode pattern in weak bear trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-ioii-and-ii-breakout-mode-pattern-in-bear-channel-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-23-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly chart has ioii and ii breakout mode pattern in bear channel\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex monthly chart has been sideways for a year. The range in March was huge. Its high was the high of the prior 12 months and its low was the low of the prior 12 months.<p>April’s high was below the March high and its low was above the March low. April was therefore an inside bar.<p>Since March was an outside bar, February was inside of March. This is an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern.<p>So far, May is within the April range, so there now consecutive inside bars, which is a ii (inside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern. The entire 4 months is now ioii.<h3>Unreliable Breakout Mode pattern</h3><p>In general, the chance of a bull breakout is the same as for a bear breakout. But there has been only one close above the 20 month moving average in 2 years. Therefore, even though the bear channel is almost flat, the bears have been consistently a little stronger. Consequently, there is a slightly greater probability of a bear breakout. If the bears get their breakout, traders will look for a test of par (1.0).<p>A Breakout Mode pattern is both a buy and sell signal. If May falls below April’s low, May would trigger a sell signal. If it goes above April’s high, it would trigger a buy signal. Sometimes it does both. Whichever it does more recently is the currently active signal.<h3>Problems that make this ioii Breakout Mode pattern less reliable</h3><p>There are problems with this ioii setup. All 4 bars are dojis. That means there is no sustained energy. No one is strongly committed to a direction. Therefore, there will be no trapped traders who will be forced to exit in a panic if wrong. That reduces the probability that a breakout of April’s range will result in a trend.<p>Additionally, Breakout Mode patterns have a better chance of leading to a trend when they come at the end of a strong trend up or down. The current ioii is coming in the middle of a yearlong tight trading range.<p>Markets have inertia. They have a strong tendency to continue what they are currently doing. That increases the chance that there will be buyers below and sellers above, resulting in a continuation of the trading range.<h3>Will a breakout lead to a trend?</h3><p>If the breakout is strong, traders will look for a trend. For example, if June is a big bear trend bar closing on its low and far below the May low, traders would expect lower prices. The opposite is true of a strong bull breakout.<p>But look at the chart. Many bars went above or below the prior month’s range over the past 2 years. In every case, the breakout reversed within a couple months and the trading range continued. This is what is most likely here as well.<p>Markets do not stay in tight trading ranges forever. Traders know that there will be a successful breakout up or down at some point. With this trading range lasting as long as it has, the breakout will probably come this year. But until there is a clear, strong breakout, traders will continue to bet on reversals.<h2>Covid-19 update</h2><p>The coronavirus pandemic is going to affect all financial markets for at least another year. I continue to think that the press and the TV pundits are doing a poor job reporting the story. Also, both political parties in Washington are doing a terrible job managing it.<p>As the CDC gets more data, they get a clearer picture of how the pandemic is affecting us. This week, they announced that 35% of infected people have no symptoms, but that they are as infectious as those with symptoms. Forty percent of all transmission comes from someone who does not yet feel sick.<p>A symptom is something that you tell the doctor, like you feel sick. This is different from a sign, which is something your doctor tells you, based on his examination of you. For example, a heart murmur is a sign.<p>Of those Covid-19 patients with symptoms, 0.4% die. However, it is 1.3% for those over 65 years old and 0.05% (1 in 2,000) for those 49 years old and younger.<p>But percentages are misleading when the number of patients is huge. If 100 million Americans get infected, which is likely, 0.05% is 50,000 people. That’s almost as many who died in the Vietnam War.<p>For people who feel sick, 3.4% get hospitalized. It is 7.4% for people over 65 years old. All of these data are based on an average person in an average life situation. If a person has other medical or socioeconomic problems, the math can be much worse.<h3>1st double-blind study on remdesivir has good results</h3><p>The New England Journal of Medicine published the summary of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 1,063 patients. It did not report the data. What they published was preliminary, but they believed it was important enough to report.<p>As I explained a few weeks ago, a double-blind study is the single most reliable way to evaluate a treatment. Double-blind means that neither the patient nor the doctor knows which patients are receiving the drug and which ones are getting a placebo.<p>All patients were hospitalized, which means they were very ill. The treatment was for 10 days. I believe that remdesivir is only available as an intravenous medicine.<p>The study found that remdesivir treated patients recovered in 11 days compared to 15 days for patients receiving the placebo. Patients who needed oxygen appeared to benefit the most.<p>There are many other studies underway using remdesivir combined with other drugs. Remember, this is a treatment of patients already infected. It has nothing to do with preventing the infection, which is the purpose of a vaccine.<h3>Moderna executives dump stock</h3><p>An SEC filing showed that Moderna’s CFO and chief medical officer sold $30 million in shares this week as the public was buying the news. Last week, Moderna touted the results of its vaccine trial. This caused a sharp rally. Now we discover that insiders immediately sold.<p>Is it because they exaggerated the news to pump up the stock price? Were they looking to dump stock at a brief, great price? Too early to tell, but unlikely.<p>Stock purchases by insiders are more reliable indicators of how well a company will do. You only buy because you believe the stock will go up.<p>There are many reasons to sell other than believing the stock will collapse. Consequently, it is a mistake to read too much into their stock sale. The SEC will probably investigate.<p>Since it is too easy to connect the dots, the executives would have to be fools if there were pumping and dumping. I bet they were just buying mansions or paying off a divorce.<h3>Direct contact with an infected person accounts for 99% of infections</h3><p>Most experts believe that 99% of infections come from being in contact with a contagious person. For example, talking with them or having them cough near you. Furthermore, most of the spread happens indoors.<p>They are also saying that fomite spread accounts for less than 1% of infections. A fomite is an object that was touched by an infected person, like a door handle.<h3>No one with a microphone cares much about the American people</h3><p>I am disappointed that so many people are unwilling to do what is right. The media should be talking about the consequences of our decisions. Instead, they are only interested in what took place today or what someone said today.<p>It is also newsworthy and more important to talk about how long the pandemic will likely last, what the economic consequences will be, and how many people will die. But presumably they are reporting in a way that maximizes their advertising dollars, and I cannot fault them for that.<p>Likewise, both parties in Washington are more interested in the November election than the lives of the American people. It’s hard to fault them either, given that our Constitution makes that their main responsibility.<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-test-2600-june-might-test-3000/#purpose-of-politicians\" target=\"_blank\">I talked about this last week</a>. It is very disappointing that no one with a platform is giving enough of a voice to the American people, who are the victims of the pandemic. Is the news of 100,000 dead Americans getting the attention it deserves? If a car crash kills 6 people, it makes national news. When 2,000 people every day die from this infection, it’s just mentioned in passing.<h3>During the pandemic, it is better to only look ahead</h3><p>It is in the best interest of Americans to have Washington only think about saving lives and the economy. Once the dangers are behind us, then we need to look back to see what we could have done better. There are going to be other pandemics and we need to do much better the next time around.<p>Since we are doing much worse than so many countries, it is clear that there are many things we could have done better. But blaming people who are responsible for solving the crisis will only upset and distract them. We need them to be completely focused on solving the many problems. The lack of blaming of one another in Washington is the one thing that both parties are currently doing right.<h3>Columbia University says 54,000 people died needlessly because of our delayed response</h3><p>I’m not in Washington and therefore do not have political constraints. Also, I am always interested in math. Dr. Fauci a few weeks ago said the obvious, that there would have been fewer deaths had we started social distancing earlier. But just like republican President Trump, democratic New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was opposed to social distancing in February. Both are at fault, and so are many others in both parties.<p>Columbia University released a study this week that concluded we would have had 54,000 fewer deaths as of May 21 had we began only 2 weeks earlier. 54,000 people died needlessly. It’s incredible that no one cares. Like Stalin said, small numbers are tragic, but big numbers are just statistics.<h3>118 firms making vaccines</h3><p>The WHO says that 118 firms around the world are working on a vaccine. Each company sees this as their lottery ticket. Who will get a contract to make a billion doses of vaccine?<p>The important point is that researchers believe that there will be a safe, effective vaccine. While unlikely, maybe dozens of vaccines. The news that Moderna released last week was good but intentionally self-serving and misleading. They spun it in a way to help get a billion dollars in funding.<p>However, it was useful to hear that their small sample of patients developed antibodies. We don’t know if those antibodies will prevent an infection or if they will last more than a few weeks, but it is clearly better news than hearing them say that no patient developed antibodies after being vaccinated.<h3>Why no vaccine in 2020?</h3><p>President Trump has said that he is going to make sure that there will be a vaccine before the end of the year. In other words, “I deserve to be re-elected because I am doing it so much faster than what the experts say is possible. Trust me, you will get it right after you re-elect me!”<p>But will you rush out and get vaccinated. Nope. Why not? Because before you and 7 billion other people get vaccinated, everyone wants to know about long-term complications in addition to immediate side effects.<p>No one died right after getting vaccinated 6 weeks ago. Good. No significant short-term complications.<p>But what happens if we discover that 1% of vaccinated patients get Guillain Barre paralysis 6 months out? Or some other nerve degeneration, or aplastic anemia, or a different permanent debilitating side effect? Don’t you want to know that before you have your kids get vaccinated? The CDC is not going to approve of a vaccine until they are certain it is safe.<h3>Why the long wait?</h3><p>Better safe than sorry. How much time do you need to be confident of no late developing side-effects? One month? For most people, it would be many months, and for some, 6 – 12 months.<p>We don’t even know if the vaccine will prevent infections. Researches might discover that you need a booster shot 2 months later. All that’s involved with creating a safe and effective vaccine makes it unlikely to have one ready for wide release by December.<p>We want to see 1,000 people vaccinated and be sure that 90% did not get infected in the next 3 – 6 months. That means we need that to be confident that the vaccine is effective. And we want to make sure that a bunch of them did not die several months out so that we will believe it is safe.<p>Do the math. No company has begun testing 1,000 patients yet (Phase 3). The testing will take many months. I doubt that any vaccine will be approved this year. While unlikely, it might even take 2 years.<h3>How will that effect the wait affect the economy?</h3><p>Many people will continue to curtail a lot of activities until there is a safe and effective vaccine. Activities cost money. Restaurants, travel, malls, shows, baseball games, concerts, movies, you name it.<p>That means reduced consumer spending. This will result in a continuation of the unemployment of many millions of people for the next year, and a lower profitability of American companies.<p>Less profit, then less E (earnings) in the P/E ratio. Therefore, the P (price) has to get smaller to keep the ratio within its historical range. If the price of stocks has to be less, the stock market will have a difficult time getting far above the current all-time high for at least a year.<p>The current trading range will then be about 4 years old. Remember, I have been saying since 2017 that the stock market will probably be in a range for about 10 years. This pandemic will get us to about half way there.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Breakout above April high triggered minor buy signal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-monthly-candlestick-chart-breakout-above-high-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly candlestick chart breakout above high 1 bull flag buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p>The S&amp;P500 Emini futures market went above the April high, triggering a monthly High 1 bull flag buy signal. The Emini has been in a bull trend for 11 years. As big as the selloff was this year, it was only a 2 bar pullback in a bull trend.<p>But, when a pullback is surprisingly big like that, traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. In 20% of cases, the 2nd leg down begins after a brief new high. Consequently, traders believe that the Emini will turn down for a month or two before making a new high. Therefore, the High 1 is a minor buy signal.<p>The month ends of Friday. When the range is small like this and there are important magnets nearby, there is an increased chance that the market will get drawn to a magnet at the end of the month. This is especially true in the final hour.<p>May so far is a bull bar. If it becomes a bigger bull bar, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in June.<p>But if May closes below its midpoint or below the April high, traders will look for June to be more sideways. If May closes on its low, June will likely trade at least a little lower.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Reversal from V bottom evolving into trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-weekly-candlestick-chart-micro-wedge-at-20-week-EMA.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-23-3.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly candlestick chart micro wedge at 20 week EMA\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed up in a V bottom from below the bottom of the 2 year trading range. It has stalled at the 20 week EMA.<p>Furthermore, the price action changed 4 weeks ago when a doji formed. That is a bar with a small body and a big tail. A big tail below means that the market sold off and then rallied. That is two-sided trading.<p>The significance is that there was a strong enough selloff to create a tail on the bar. A doji is a strong bull trend is an early sign that the strong trend is losing momentum. Traders begin to think about a trading range.<p>The rally sometimes continues for 5 – 10 more bars before there is a big enough reversal down to begin a trading range. But once it does reverse down, the minimum target is a test of the bottom of the doji.<p>Sometimes, instead of continuing up, the Emini begins a trading range with that doji bar. That is what has happened in this case. There has only been one big bull trend bar in the past 5 weeks. The other bars have had small bodies and big tails. Also, the bars have mostly overlapped one another.<h3>Rally losing momentum</h3><p>While there have been a couple new highs since that doji of 5 weeks ago, they have been brief. There can still be another leg up from here without much of a pullback. But if there is, it will probably only last a few weeks. Additionally, it will likely be only a bull leg in a trading range that began with that doji 4 weeks ago.<h3>Micro wedge increases chance of pullback</h3><p>This week is the 3rd high in the past 6 weeks. There is now a micro wedge on the weekly chart. This week is the sell signal bar. But this week had a bull body. It is therefore a weak sell signal bar. Traders expect that there will be buyers below this week’s low.<p>The one caveat is that Friday is also the end of the month. If there is a strong reversal down by the end of the week, there will be a sell signal bar on the monthly chart. That would erase the bullishness of this week’s bull close.<p>It is important to note that the 2 month bull channel is tight. Consequently, if there is a reversal down in June, it should be minor in the sense that it will probably not fall below the March low. Traders will look for a couple legs down for a month or two and expect a higher low.<p>A selloff often retraces about half of the rally. Therefore, the Emini will probably fall to 2,600 – 2,700 in June. But, as I said, traders will buy the selloff. They expect at least a small 2nd leg up after a 35% rally in 2 months.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Sell zone between 3,000 and 3,100</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-daily-candlestick-chart-micro-double-bottom-after-breakout-above-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-23-4.png\" alt=\"Emini daily candlestick chart micro double bottom after breakout above double top\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke above the April wedge top this week. When there is a breakout above a top, in general, there is a 50% chance of a trend up and a 50% chance of a failed breakout and another attempt at a top.<p>But the probability for the bulls is higher here. There are magnets above, the bull trend is strong, and Friday closed near its high. Traders expect next week to go at least a little higher. The 200 day moving average is the minimum goal.<p>The Emini spent the week oscillating around the April high. When May went above the April high, the Emini triggered a buy signal on the monthly chart.<p>Traders are deciding if the breakout above the April high will succeed or fail. If May closes far above the April high, traders will expect higher prices in June. They will expect sideways to down trading in June if May closes around or below the April high.<p>If there is a trend up, traders will look for a measured move up based on the height of the month-long trading range. The target would be just above the March 3 lower high.<p>That March 3 lower high is very important. It was the end of the 1st pullback after the February collapse. That makes it the start of the March parabolic wedge sell climax.<h3>A reversal up typically tests the start of the last leg down</h3><p>When the Emini reverses up from a Spike and Wedge Bear Channel like this, the rally typically works it way to the start of the channel. At that point, traders expect the bull trend to evolve into a trading range.<p>So the measured move target based on the 3 week double bottom is at a very important price. Also, the rally is extreme. Yet, it followed a huge bear trend. There will probably be a 2nd leg sideways to down. A test of the March 3 high would be a good location for the start of that 2nd leg down.<h3>The Sell Zone is between 3,000 and 3,100</h3><p>The rally does not have to make it all the way to the March 3 high before exhausting itself. It is near enough now for traders to see it as a satisfactory test. They would be more convinced that the bulls have exhausted themselves if the rally was closer to the March 31 high.<p>However, the Emini could still begin a 50% selloff from this week’s high or just a little higher. The 200 day simple moving average is an important magnet and it is only about 15 points above this week’s high.<p>The Emini will probably have to get there before it reverses down. So the sell zone is between the 200 day moving average, around 3,000, and the March 3 high, around 3,100. Bulls will take profits there and the bears will begin to short.<p>It is important to note that the March collapse was 35% and the May rally is now 35% above the March low. Markets like symmetry, and this is another factor that works against the bulls near-term.<h3>Bear legs in trading ranges typically fill gaps</h3><p>I said that a 10% correction is a reasonable goal for the bears. However, the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years. Selloffs typically fall below breakout points.<p>The April rally broke strongly above the March 31 high. That high is therefore the breakout point. There is a gap above that high and below the April 21 pullback. Gaps in trading ranges usually get filled.<p>At some point this year, the Emini should fall below that high of 2629.50. Since that is near the 2600 Big Round Number, traders should expect a test of 2,600 this year. It could come in the next couple months.<h3>What will the borders of the upcoming trading range be?</h3><p>The top of the range for the remainder of the year will probably be around the March 3 high. That was the start of the parabolic wedge sell climax. The start of the climax usually gets tested and then there is typically a leg down.<p>There are a couple other important prices that I have not mentioned in a few weeks. When the Emini fell 10% from the high, it entered a correction. That price is 3,054.38, which is in my 3,000 – 3,100 sell zone.<p>When the Emini fell 20%, it entered a bear market. That is 2706.00. There is a 70% chance that the Emini will test below that level before the end of the year. When it does, the news will be that the stock market is back in a bear market. As I said many times, I think it will fall below the March 31 high of 2629.50 because that is a breakout point.<p>Therefore, a rough guide of where the Emini will probably be for the rest of the year is between 10 and 20% down from the high. That is approximately between 2,600 and 3,100. Traders will likely look to buy when its around 2700 and sell when it is above 3,000 to around 3,100.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini spent the entire week in a tight range oscillating around the April high.<p>This is the final week of the month. If this week closes above the April high, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in May.<p>Friday was a pullback in a bull trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. However, it had only a small bull body and it is therefore not a strong buy signal bar. Additionally, it followed a big bear bar. Also, there is a 5 day tight trading range. These factors lower the probability of a big rally today. But, the Emini should work at least a little higher.<p>Friday had a bull body on the daily chart and last week had a bull body on the weekly chart. The 200 day moving average and the March 3 lower high are magnets above. Traders expect the 2 month bull trend to reach at least the 200 day moving average at some point this week.<p>However, the entire rally is only a leg in a 2 1/2 year trading range. Traders expect a bear leg. The sell zone is around the 200 day moving average and the March 3 lower high. That means 3,000 – 3,100.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 59 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap up on both the daily and weekly charts. A big gap up increases the chance of a trend day. Up is more likely than down.<p>However, the chart will open far above the average price. The 20 bar EMA is one measure of the average price. Many bulls will only pay far above average if the price action is far above average.<p>If the bulls do not get consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs within the first 5 bars, traders will expect the Emini to enter a trading range. This happens 80% of the time when there is a big gap up or down. The bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bull flag near the EMA, which traders see as an average price. But the bears want the breakout to fail. They will look for a wedge top or double top and a swing down.<p>When there is a trading range open, there is a reduced chance of a huge trend day. That early sideways trading is a sign that traders see the price as just about right. They become less willing to buy too far above or sell too far below. Therefore, the breakout of the range usually leads to a 2 – 3 hour trend, and then either a reversal or a trading range.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-lower-low-and-then-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-26.png\" alt=\"Emini lower low and then higher low major trend reversal \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

This is Breakout Mode. The last time the chart was clear was at the top of the March 27 rally. Traders assume that the trading range is slightly more likely to have a successful upside breakout.<p>There is a head and shoulders bottom. The EURUSD rallied from the May 7 higher low. It then pulled back and formed another higher low yesterday.<p>Today so far is a big bull trend bar on the daily chart. But it is important to note that the chart is still in its 2 month range. It sold off from this price level twice in the past 2 months. Traders know that trading ranges have strong legs up and down. They also know that there is no breakout until there is a clear breakout.<p>The bulls need consecutive bars closing above the May 1 high to conclude that the breakout will probably continue up to the next resistance. That is the March 27 high.<p>A more important target is the March 9 buy climax high. That is also the high of the past 19 months. If the EURUSD closes above that, traders will believe that the 2 year bear trend has ended.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD rallied overnight on the 5 minute chart overnight. Day traders were only buying.<p>There was a 20 pip pullback 3 hours ago and then again over the past hour. Traders are wondering if the bull trend is transitioning into a trading range. These pullbacks are big enough to make day traders begin to short for scalps. However, they will continue to buy. They know that it is easier to make money as a bull when the chart is in a bull trend.<p>The bulls want today to close on its high. That will increase the chance of a break above the 2 month range tomorrow. The bears always want the opposite. A bear trend today is unlikely after such a strong overnight rally.<p>However, the bears want the day to close well off its high. They will therefore sell rallies. If there is a 20 – 30 pip tall tail on the top of the candlestick on the daily chart, traders will see that as hesitation. It will reduce the chance of a breakout tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-resumption-at-200-day-moving-average.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption at 200 day moving average\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up from above yesterday’s high in a big High 2 bull flag and entered a trading range. The bears got trend resumption down at the end of the day and the Emini closed back at the 200 day moving average.<p>Since today closed on its low, it is a sell signal bar for tomorrow. The bears see today as a failed breakout above the 200 day moving average. However, the March 3 high is still an important magnet above. Therefore, there might be more buyers than sellers below today’s low.<p>The Emini is now in the sell zone, which is between the 200 day moving average and the March 3 lower high. It will probably be unable to break much above that high without first retracing about half of the 2 month rally.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It sold off and closed back at the 200 day moving average. Since it closed near its low, it is a sell signal bar for today.<p>However, the March 3 high is an important magnet above. That was the start of the March collapse and its high is a magnet above. Therefore, a reversal down until the Emini gets there will probably be minor.<p>The Emini is now in the Sell Zone on the daily chart. That is between the 200 day moving average and the March 3 lower high. The bulls will probably not be able to get much above that high without 1st retracing about half of the 2 month rally. Therefore, the probability and risk/reward over the next month or two is beginning to favor the bears.<h3>This week affects the monthly chart</h3><p>This is the final week of May. May is the entry bar on the monthly chart for a High 1 bull flag.<p>So far, May is a big bull bar closing on its high. If the month closes like this, it would increase the chance of higher prices.<p>However, the bears expect a 10% selloff to begin soon. They will try to get May to end at 50 or more points below the high of the month. That would put a tail on this month’s candlestick and reduce the chance of much higher prices in June.<p>The fight for the remainder of the week will be over the appearance of May’s candlestick on the monthly chart. If the Emini is near the high of the month on Thursday or Friday, traders should be ready for a possible selloff into the end of the week on Friday.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 31 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap above yesterday’s high. It will gap far above yesterday’s close on the 5 minute chart. Also, it will reverse yesterday’s late selloff. Day traders will therefore expect a measured move up today or tomorrow based on that failed bear breakout.<p>When there is a big gap up above yesterday’s close, the Emini is far above the 20 bar EMA. That is a reasonable estimate of the average price.<p>Traders do not want to pay far above average unless the price action is far above average. The bulls want to see several big bull bars closing near their highs on the open.<p>That is not what typically happens. Instead, the Emini usually enters a trading range for an hour or two. The bulls will look to buy either a double bottom or a wedge bull flag near the EMA.<p>Since the bears want the gap up to fail, they want a sell pattern. They will look for a double top or a wedge rally to sell for a swing down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-resumption-at-200-day-moving-average.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-27.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption at 200 day moving average\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That is also the neckline of a head and shoulders bottom. The bulls want a measured move up and then a test of the March high.<p>In general, if there is a close above the neckline, there is a 50% chance of a swing up and a 50% chance of a failed breakout and a reversal down. If the close is far above, the odds improve for the bulls. Furthermore, if the bulls get consecutive closes above, the math is even better. Finally, if they get consecutive big bull bars closing on their highs and above the trading range, there will be a 60% chance of a measured move up.<p>At the moment, the bulls have none of that. But they might get all of it over the next few days. Therefore, what happens over the next several days can change the expectation of traders for the next month or more.<p>The bears want a bear bar closing near its low at some point this week. If they get it, traders will conclude that the breakout is failing. They then will look for a reversal down to the middle or bottom of the 2 month trading range.<p>There are 3 trading days left to May. I talked about the ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern on the monthly chart over the weekend. The bulls want the month to close on its high, whether or not it goes above the April high and triggers the buy signal. If it closes on its high, traders will see May as also a buy signal bar for June.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight to just above the May 1 high. It then pulled back below that high. This is not how the strongest breakouts behave. It is a reminder that the daily chart has been in a trading range for 2 months and most breakout attempts fail.<p>Today’s close is important. The bulls will buy pullbacks because they want today to close above the top of the trading range on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of higher prices tomorrow. They want tomorrow to close even higher.<p>The bears always want the opposite. They will sell at the May high and at today’s high and try to get the breakout to fail. They then want today or tomorrow to have a bear body and close near its low. That would increase the chance of a reversal down over the next couple weeks.<p>Can today be a big trend day up or down? It does not look like it. Instead, the day will probably close around yesterday’s high and be a small bull day, or it will close near the open and be a doji day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-outside-up-day-at-200-day-moving-average-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day at 200 day moving average\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was an outside up day after a very strong early selloff. This increases the chance of higher prices tomorrow.<p>The Emini is now in the Sell Zone, which is above the 200 day moving average and the March 3 high. Since that high is a strong magnet, the Emini will probably get there. However, the math is becoming better for the bears on the daily chart.<p>Friday is the end of the month. The bulls want the month to close on its high. But the bears will try to put a 50 point tail on the top of May on the monthly chart. That will reduce the chance of much higher prices in June.

It sold off and closed back at the 200 day moving average. Since it closed near its low, it is a sell signal bar for today.<p>However, the March 3 high is an important magnet above. That was the start of the March collapse and its high is a magnet above. Therefore, a reversal down until the Emini gets there will probably be minor.<p>The Emini is now in the Sell Zone on the daily chart. That is between the 200 day moving average and the March 3 lower high. The bulls will probably not be able to get much above that high without 1st retracing about half of the 2 month rally. Therefore, the probability and risk/reward over the next month or two is beginning to favor the bears.<h3>This week affects the monthly chart</h3><p>This is the final week of May. May is the entry bar on the monthly chart for a High 1 bull flag.<p>So far, May is a big bull bar closing on its high. If the month closes like this, it would increase the chance of higher prices.<p>However, the bears expect a 10% selloff to begin soon. They will try to get May to end at 50 or more points below the high of the month. That would put a tail on this month’s candlestick and reduce the chance of much higher prices in June.<p>The fight for the remainder of the week will be over the appearance of May’s candlestick on the monthly chart.

It was therefore an outside up day. That increases the chance of higher prices today or tomorrow.<p>The Emini is in the Sell Zone on the daily chart, which is between the 200 day moving average and the March 3 lower high. It will probably get to the March 3 high before exhausting itself. Once the bulls are exhausted, there will probably be a 50% retracement of the 2 month rally.<p>Tomorrow is the end of the month. Traders are thinking about what May will look like on the monthly chart. If the bulls can get May to close near its high, traders will expect higher prices in June.<p>The bears want a conspicuous tail on the top of this month’s candlestick on the monthly chart. To achieve that, they will need May to close at least 50 points below this week’s high. There is therefore an increased chance of a selloff today or tomorrow. If the bears succeed, it will reduce the chance of the bulls having a strong June.<p>Regardless of what happens, traders should expect a selloff for several weeks now that the daily chart is in the sell zone. It probably will begin closer to the March 3 high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 2 points in the Globex session. Yesterday rallied in a very strong bull trend. That typically attracts profit taking. There is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading today that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>For the bears, their 1st target is the bottom of the most recent buy climax from yesterday. That is around 12:10 PST on the 5 minute chart. They probably cannot get a strong trend down without the Emini first transitioning into a trading range for an hour or two.<p>The bulls always want a big bull trend day. After a buy climax day, there is a 50% chance of some follow-through buying in the 1st 2 hours, but only a 25% chance of another strong bull day.<p>After a big outside up day, there is an increased chance of an inside day. If today opens below yesterday’s high, it might reverse down from below yesterday’s high. Since yesterday’s range was big and today will open near yesterday’s high, today will probably not fall below yesterday’s low.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-outside-up-day-at-200-day-moving-average-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-28.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day at 200 day moving average\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But the breakout so far is small and it has a wedge shape.<p>If the bulls do not start to get closes far above the top of the range, traders will expect a test back down. A test of resistance often has 3 legs up, which means it is a wedge. A wedge is a type of sell climax.<p>When there is a reversal down, traders look for at least a couple legs down. The 1st target for the bears is the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the May 25 low.<p>May ends in a few days. So far, it is within the April range on the monthly chart (not shown). April is also within the March range. Consecutive inside bars is an ii pattern (inside-inside). That often leads to a breakout that lasts many bars. Traders might be waiting for June before creating a strong breakout.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small range overnight. It traded again above the May 1 high but reversed down.<p>Today so far has a bull body on the daily chart. However, the bodies are shrinking as the bulls try to get a successful breakout. Shrinking bodies mean there is a loss of momentum. There are fewer bulls eager to buy at this price.<p>The bulls still hope for a strong breakout. At a minimum, they want another bull body on the daily chart. They will buy selloffs and try to have the day close above the open. They prefer to have it close above yesterday’s high. That would indicate that the momentum is increasing. It would increase the chance that this breakout will be successful.<p>The bears want today to be a sell signal bar on the daily chart. They hope the rally is just a wedge buy climax and a test of the top of the 2 month range. The bears have been selling rallies overnight, but have been unable to make more than a scalp. They will try to get today to close below the open. Today would then have a bear body and be a better sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>So far, the bars and legs today have been small. Day traders have only been scalping. Because the daily chart is at a critical location, there is an increased chance of a surprisingly big move up or down. However, the odds favor a continuation of the quiet trading and small range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It got back above 3044.25, which is 10% down from the high. It therefore was no longer in correction territory. However, it collapsed back to that price, which was near today’s open, in the final hour.<p>Today was a reversal day on the daily chart. It is therefore a sell signal bar. However, the bears took profits into the close and today had a prominent tail below on the daily chart.<p>Remember, the Emini is in the Sell Zone. I went short today and I plan to scale in higher. The rally might reach the March 3 high before the reversal down begins. The Emini should retrace about half of the 2 month rally before making a new all-time high.<p>Traders are paying attention to that 10% pullback level.

It was therefore an outside up day. That increases the chance of higher prices today or tomorrow.<p>The Emini is in the Sell Zone on the daily chart, which is between the 200 day moving average and the March 3 lower high. It will probably get to the March 3 high before exhausting itself. Once the bulls are exhausted, there will probably be a 50% retracement of the 2 month rally.<p>Tomorrow is the end of the month. Traders are thinking about what May will look like on the monthly chart. If the bulls can get May to close near its high, traders will expect higher prices in June.<p>The bears want a conspicuous tail on the top of this month’s candlestick on the monthly chart. To achieve that, they will need May to close at least 50 points below this week’s high. There is therefore an increased chance of a selloff today or tomorrow. If the bears succeed, it will reduce the chance of the bulls having a strong June.<p>Regardless of what happens, traders should expect a selloff for several weeks now that the daily chart is in the sell zone. It probably will begin closer to the March 3 high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 2 points in the Globex session. Yesterday rallied in a very strong bull trend. That typically attracts profit taking. There is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading today that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>For the bears, their 1st target is the bottom of the most recent buy climax from yesterday. That is around 12:10 PST on the 5 minute chart. They probably cannot get a strong trend down without the Emini first transitioning into a trading range for an hour or two.<p>The bulls always want a big bull trend day. After a buy climax day, there is a 50% chance of some follow-through buying in the 1st 2 hours, but only a 25% chance of another strong bull day.<p>After a big outside up day, there is an increased chance of an inside day. If today opens below yesterday’s high, it might reverse down from below yesterday’s high. Since yesterday’s range was big and today will open near yesterday’s high, today will probably not fall below yesterday’s low.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-outside-up-day-at-200-day-moving-average-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-28.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day at 200 day moving average\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-rally-to-top-of-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-28-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex wedge rally to top of trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied to slightly above the 2 month trading range. But the breakout so far is small and it has a wedge shape.<p>If the bulls do not start to get closes far above the top of the range, traders will expect a test back down. A test of resistance often has 3 legs up, which means it is a wedge. A wedge is a type of sell climax.<p>When there is a reversal down, traders look for at least a couple legs down. The 1st target for the bears is the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the May 25 low.<p>May ends in a few days. So far, it is within the April range on the monthly chart (not shown). April is also within the March range. Consecutive inside bars is an ii pattern (inside-inside). That often leads to a breakout that lasts many bars. Traders might be waiting for June before creating a strong breakout.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small range overnight. It traded again above the May 1 high but reversed down.<p>Today so far has a bull body on the daily chart. However, the bodies are shrinking as the bulls try to get a successful breakout. Shrinking bodies mean there is a loss of momentum. There are fewer bulls eager to buy at this price.<p>The bulls still hope for a strong breakout. At a minimum, they want another bull body on the daily chart. They will buy selloffs and try to have the day close above the open. They prefer to have it close above yesterday’s high. That would indicate that the momentum is increasing. It would increase the chance that this breakout will be successful.<p>The bears want today to be a sell signal bar on the daily chart. They hope the rally is just a wedge buy climax and a test of the top of the 2 month range. The bears have been selling rallies overnight, but have been unable to make more than a scalp. They will try to get today to close below the open. Today would then have a bear body and be a better sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>So far, the bars and legs today have been small. Day traders have only been scalping. Because the daily chart is at a critical location, there is an increased chance of a surprisingly big move up or down. However, the odds favor a continuation of the quiet trading and small range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It got back above 3044.25, which is 10% down from the high. It therefore was no longer in correction territory. However, it collapsed back to that price, which was near today’s open, in the final hour.<p>Today was a reversal day on the daily chart. It is therefore a sell signal bar. However, the bears took profits into the close and today had a prominent tail below on the daily chart.<p>Remember, the Emini is in the Sell Zone. I went short today and I plan to scale in higher. The rally might reach the March 3 high before the reversal down begins. The Emini should retrace about half of the 2 month rally before making a new all-time high.<p>Traders are paying attention to that 10% pullback level. It is therefore a potential magnet tomorrow.<p>Tomorrow is the end of the week and of the month. Both charts are bullish. But there is often profit taking just before a closes. Therefore, there is an increased chance of at least a small reversal down tomorrow, especially in the final hour. Also, after 2 strong days up, tomorrow will probably not be a strong bull day.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is 10% down from the high and a correction is defined as a selloff of 10%. It collapsed back to that price, which was near the open of the day, at the end of the day. Breakouts often fail. Therefore, today and the month might close below that number. It could be a magnet at the end of the day.<p>It is important to remember that the Emini is in the Sell Zone. The math is good for trades going short. The zone is from the 200 day EMA to the March 3 high. Yesterday is a sell signal day, but it had a prominent tail below. The bears should have their stops above the all-time high because the Emini could easily go a little above the March 3 high before the selloff begins.<p>Remember, picking the exact top in a bull trend is a low probability bet. Therefore, yesterday is probably not the end of the rally, especially when there is an important magnet above.<p>But it might be, and the Emini is in a zone where the math is becoming good for the bears. But, it is only worth shorting if a trader can trade a small enough position to rely on a stop above the all-time high.<h3>Last day of the week and month</h3><p>Today is the last day of the week and month. What happens affects the appearance of the weekly and monthly charts. So far, this week is a big bull bar trading near its high on the monthly chart.<p>It is a doji candlestick on the weekly chart. But if the week closes near the high of the week, traders will expect higher prices next week.<p>The most important price is 3125.75. That is the March 3 high and the start of the March crash. If the bulls break strongly above it, they will probably get a new all-time high this summer.<p>At the moment, it is more likely that the rally will get exhausted around that price. Traders would then look for about a 50% retracement of the rally and a continuation of the 2 1/2 year trading range.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 10 points in the Globex session. Traders will pay attention to the appearance of the weekly an monthly chart today. After yesterdays’s Big Up, Big Down, there is Big Confusion. That increases the chance of trading range price action today.<p>The bulls want the day, week, and month to close on their highs. Because all 3 time frames are in bull trends, there is an increased chance of a rally a the end of the day.<p>The best the bears can probably get today is a close below the open of the week. That is just below yesterday’s low. Consequently, even with yesterday’s strong selling, the Emini will probably not form a big bear trend day today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-29.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg up and possibly a measured move up.<p>The rally is now at the March 27 high. This is interesting because the bulls who bought that strong close never had a chance to exit without a loss after seeing the bear bar on the next day. Today is their chance to exit without a loss. Will they take it?<p>If the EURUSD stalls here for 2 – 3 days, it would indicate that a lot of bulls are exiting. That would increase the chance of a pullback, maybe to below the neckline of the head and shoulders bottom.<p>But if the next 2 – 3 days are also bull days closing near their highs, traders will expect the rally to test the March 9 high within a few weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight to the March 27 high. But it has stalled in a 20 pip range over the past 4 hours. The pullbacks are too small for the bears to short. However, if it continues sideways here, they will become increasingly confident and day traders will start to short.<p>The stall indicates hesitation on the part of the bulls. They have switched from swing trading to scalping.<p>Even though the EURUSD has stalled, it is still forming small higher lows and highs. Therefore it is still in a bull channel on the 5 minute chart. Day traders know there is a chance of another leg up from here. Since the day’s range is already big, if there is a breakout above the March 27 high, the rally will probably not go up much higher today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Since the day’s range is already big, if there is a breakout above the March 27 high, the rally will probably not go up much higher today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>Early today, I took profits on my shorts from yesterday, but I think it is okay to be short. I expect I will be able to get short again higher, like around 3,100.<p>The Emini sold off early but reversed up. The reversal up was a bull major surprise. Traders expect some follow-through buying on Monday.<p>Today closed above 3044.25, which is 10% down from the all-time high. The Emini is therefore no longer in correction territory.<p>The day closed near the high. It is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for Monday. on the daily chart.<p>Today was the last trading day of the month. May was a strong entry bar for the High 1 bull flag on the monthly chart. But, there will probably be sellers above 3,100.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But it is in the Sell Zone. In the next couple months, it will more likely retrace about half of the 2 month rally than break to a new all-time high.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>monthly chart has consecutive inside bars after a reversal down from an extreme buy climax. Although the upside is limited, if there is a selloff, it will probably be gradual.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market triggered an ioi buy signal this month on the monthly chart. However, it is still below the 20 month EMA, as it has been for 2 years. The bulls need strong follow-through buying next month to convince traders that the bear trend is reversing up into a bull trend.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures monthly chart:</strong><br>ii Breakout Mode after buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-ii-breakout-mode-pattern-after-most-extreme-buy-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-30.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart has ii breakout mode pattern after most extreme buy climax.png\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures reversed down on the monthly chart at the end of March after a 3 month buy climax. It was the most extreme buy climax in the history of the bond market.<p>Bond futures on the weekly chart (not shown) have been in a tight trading range for 2 months. On the monthly chart, May’s high was below April’s high and May’s low was above April’s low. May was therefore an inside bar on the monthly chart.<p>April was also a small inside bar. There are now consecutive inside bars, which is a 2 bar tight trading range. This is an ii (inside-inside) setup, which is a Breakout Mode pattern.<h3>Breakout Mode is both a buy and sell setup</h3><p>Because it is coming late in a bull trend and after a buy climax, the upside potential is small. The bulls will have a hard time getting far above the March high.<p>Also, since May was a bear bar, it is a low probability buy signal bar. That reduces the chance of June being the start of a rally up to the March high. If June goes above May, it probably will not get far. The ii would then convert into a 3 month tight trading range.<p>Since May had a bear body, it is a good sell signal bar. It increases the chance that a reversal down will be successful.<p>A successful breakout means about 10 or more bars and 2 or more legs. The 1st target for a reversal down from a buy climax is the start of the buy climax. That is the January low. Since that is far below the ii, a selloff might need a year to get there.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex weekly chart:</strong><br>May triggered monthly ioi buy signal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-monthly-Forex-candlestick-chart-has-breakout-ioi-at-bull-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-30-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD monthly Forex candlestick chart has breakout ioi at bull trend line\"></a></figure><p>The monthly chart of the EURUSD Forex market formed a huge bar in March. Its high was the highest price in the prior 13 months and its low was the lowest price in 3 years. It was an outside bar. It traded above the February high and below the February low.<p>April’s high was below the March high and its low was above the March low. Therefore April was in inside bar after an outside bar. Inside-outside-inside is an ioi setup, which is a Breakout Mode pattern. This week, May went above the April high. It therefore triggered a monthly buy signal.<p>This is not a strong setup. April had a bear body and the past 3 months were all doji bars. A breakout of a weak Breakout Mode setup has a reduced chance of starting a trend. The bulls will need a big bull bar in June to make traders believe that the May buy signal is the start of a move up to the March high.<p>If they do not get a strong bull bar, traders will think that the breakout will fail to convert the sideways market into a bull trend. They will assume that the monthly chart will continue sideways for at least a couple more months.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EURUSD-weekly-Forex-candlestick-chart-has-breakout-above-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-30-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD weekly Forex candlestick chart has breakout above triangle\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart formed a big bull bar this week. After the strong reversal up from the March low, there was a pullback that formed a small double bottom. It was double bottom bull flag.<p>The rally this week is a resumption of the March reversal up. The context is good for the bulls. Traders expect higher prices next week. If next week is also a big bull bar, there would be a 50% chance it would continue up to the March high.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong entry bar after High 1 bull flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-breakout-above-High-1-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-30-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart has breakout above High 1 bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;had a big 2 bar pullback in an 11 year bull trend in February and March. But a 2 bar selloff is not enough to make a bear trend. April was a big bull bar closing near its high. It was therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>May triggered the buy signal by going above the April high. May had a good size body and it closed near its high. It was therefore a strong entry bar for the High 1 bull flag. A strong buy signal bar and a strong entry bar make higher prices likely.<p>Will this rally continue up to a new all-time high? February and March formed a huge selloff. A big Bear Surprise breakout has a 70% chance of at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. However, 20% of the time, the 2nd leg does not begin until after there is a new high.<p>With April and May being very strong, there is now a 30% chance that the rally will continue up to a new high without another pullback on the monthly chart.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>V bottom rally, but losing momentum</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-bull-channel-and-V-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-30-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart has bull channel and V bottom\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is still rallying in a V bottom reversal since March 23, But, the rally changed its behavior 6 weeks ago.<p>Prior to that, the bodies of the candlestick were big. However, once the Emini reached the 20 week EMA, the bodies shrank and the tails became more prominent. That is a sign that the rally is losing momentum. It is the represents hesitation and more two-sided trading. That is the start of trading range price action.<p>Even though that rally has continued, that 1st doji 6 weeks ago is now a target. Once there is a selloff, traders should expect it to reach the bottom of that bar, which is around 2,700. There are reasons on the daily chart to expect the selloff to get to 2,600.<h3>Bull leg in trading range leads to bear leg</h3><p>The rally from that doji from 6 weeks ago is probably a bull leg in what will become a trading range. That means there will be a bear leg down to around the bottom of that bar. At that point, traders will say that the weekly chart is no longer in a bull trend and instead is in a trading range.<p>It is too early to know if this week is the end of the rally. As I discuss in the section below about the daily chart, there is an important magnet above 3,100 at the March 3 high. However, the rally is probably near the top of what will be a trading range for at least a couple months.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>2 month rally is now in the Sell Zone between 3,000 and 3,150</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-no-longer-in-correction.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-5-30-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart no longer in correction\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart rallied strongly this week. It broke above the 200 day moving average. It also went above 3044.25, which is 10% down from the all-time high. As long as it is above 3044.25, it is no longer in correction territory.<p>The next target is the one I’ve talked the most about since the March low. It is the March 3 high. That was the start of the March parabolic wedge sell climax. When a sell climax reverses, the rally usually tests the start of the sell climax. At that point, the bulls are usually exhausted and the rally evolves into a trading range.<p>At the March 23 low, the odds were that the bulls would need 2 – 3 legs to reach it. However, the V bottom rally is getting there without more than a 3 day pullback.<p>It does not have to reach it for traders to conclude the test is adequate. Also, it might go a little above it before reversing down.<p>But unless the bulls get a new all-time high, traders will call this rally either a leg in a 2 1/2 year trading range or a bear rally. Since it began, I have said that it is probably a leg in a trading range and that the trading range should last all year. That is still what is likely.<h3>The sell zone is between 3,000 and 3,150</h3><p>Most traders correctly believe that this rally is a strong leg in a trading range. They do not yet think it is a resumption of the 11 year bull trend. If it is part of a trading range, the 2 highest resistance levels are the 200 day moving average and the March 31 high. That means between 3,000 and 3,150.<p>This creates a favorable trade for the bears. If they sell in this zone and put a stop above the all-time high, they are risking 300 – 400 points. They expect a 50% pullback, which would be 400 – 500 points below their entry price. That means that their reward is greater than their risk.<p>The rally is still only a leg in a trading range. Therefore, the probability is that the Emini will test 2600 before it reaches a new high. They therefore are more likely to make their reward than lose their risk.<p>Could this week be the high? While it’s possible, picking the exact top is a low probability undertaking. This is especially true in a strong bull trend with an important magnet above. That is why traders think more in terms of a zone. They expect that the 1st top will not be the final top. But, they think the final top will not be much higher.<h3>What happens in the Sell Zone?</h3><p>It is an important level for strong bulls and bears. Both believed that the rally was going to be a bear leg in a trading range and not a resumption of the 11 year bull trend. The top of the trading range is a logical location for the bulls to take profits and the bears to sell.<p>But many strong bulls were surprised by how far up the rally went. Why haven’t other bulls taken profits and why haven’t the strong bears sold strongly?<p>The bulls are wondering if they can get a new high. They know that strong bears will be selling here and as the rally continues up to the old high. But if the bulls can get a new high, everyone will conclude that the bear case is not tenable. The Emini would then be either in a trading range or a bull trend. Until then, it is still in trading range or a bear trend.<p>This price level is therefore a breakout zone. Will the strong bears win and create a 50% retracement, or will the strong bulls win and get a new high? Until there is a new high, the odds favor the bears.<h3>Good risk/reward with good probability is unusual</h3><p>It is fairly unusual to find a trade where both the risk/reward and the probability are on your side. Granted, neither is strongly on the side of the bears, but they both favor the shorts now that the Emini is around 3,100. Consequently, it is reasonable for traders to consider shorting in this sell zone. The closer to the March high, the better the risk/reward.<p>The bulls understand the math. This area is a good level for them to take profits. They then can look to buy again between 2,600 and 2,700.<p>If they exit and the Emini continues up to a new high, they can always buy at a new high if the breakout is strong.<h3>When will the rally end?</h3><p>The 2 month rally is still probably just a strong bull leg in a trading range. Traders expect that there will eventually be a bear leg in the range before there is a new all-time high.<p>The rally is very strong. Traders will bet that reversals down will not get far or last long. Every selloff for 2 months has reversed back up within 3 days.<p>A bull trend often has to transition into a trading range before it reverses down. Therefore, even if this week is the end of the rally, the Emini could go sideways for several weeks before clearly trending down. By the time traders conclude that the top is in, the selloff will probably be more than half over.<h3>How far down will a reversal go?</h3><p>When there is a reversal, the 1st target traders mention is a 50% pullback. That is currently around 2600.<p>Also, many institutions pay attention to the 50, 100, 150, and 200 day moving averages. The Emini broke above the 200 day this week. If it reverses down, traders will expect a test of the 50 day moving average. That is currently just below 2800.<p>Another target is the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the May 14 low of 2760. It is at the bottom of a month-long trading range. That trading came late is a bull trend. It is therefore a potential Final Bull Flag. A reversal down from the breakout above a Final Bull Flag typically tests the bottom of the flag.<p>I mentioned that the Emini closed above 3044.25 this week. That means it was no longer in correction territory, which is a selloff of 10% below the high.<p>Another important pullback is 20% down from the high. When the Emini is below that, it is in a bear market. That price is 2706.00 and it is another magnet.<h3>The March 31 high is a breakout point and therefore a magnet below</h3><p>When the market is in a trading range, the bull legs tend to go above support that seems too far to reach. The March 3 high is an example.<p>The bear legs often fall below support that is so far down that traders do not think it will get tested. The March 31 high is an example. The strong breakout in April was a break above that high. That is the breakout point.<p>There was a pullback on April 21 that did not get close to that support. There is now a gap below the April 21 low and above the March 31 high.<p>If a traders is looking for a support level that is much lower than what experts on TV are saying, that’s the one. Unless the Emini breaks above the all-time high, there is a 60% chance that it will fall below 2629.50 before the end of the year. As I mentioned above, that 2600 is also a 50% pullback, which is common after a strong rally.<p>The Emini could get there this summer. October is another month when there is often a surprisingly big selloff.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
