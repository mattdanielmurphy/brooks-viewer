It was a bear bar on the daily chart and a reversal down from the top of the 2 month trading range.<p>Traders do not yet know if the pullback will last only 1 – 3 days, like all of the other pullbacks for 2 months. With the daily chart in a buy climax, the pullback might instead last a couple weeks. If so, a reasonable target is the start of the bull channel. That is either the October 18 or October 31 low.<p>I have been saying that the Emini was probably going to begin a 2 week, 50 – 100 pullback by the end of November. If this is not the start, it will probably begin within a couple weeks.<p>A buy climax typically attracts profit takers. But the bull trend is so strong that the bulls will buy the pullback. Therefore, the best the bears can probably get is a 2 – 3 week pullback. They will likely need a double top before they can get a 5% correction.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini rallied overnight and then reversed down. It is currently unchanged. Traders know that many bulls will be quick to take profits in the extended buy climax on the daily chart. There is therefore a higher probability of one or more bear trend days this week.<p>Furthermore, many bulls will take profits above any recent high. Traders should expect a 50 – 100 point pullback to begin this week. Even though the Emini has had many bull days over the past several weeks, profit taking will probably begin to create some bear days. That reduces the chance of a continued strong bull trend this week.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-double-top-bear-flag-then-bear-channel-before-early-close.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double top bear flag then bear channel before early close\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It has been sideways for 6 days.<p>Traders are deciding if there will be a reversal up from here for a 2nd leg up from the nested wedge bottom if October 1. They expect a 2nd leg up after the October rally, which was the strongest rally on the weekly chart (<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/market-analysis/emini-buy-climax-testing-tops-several-bull-channels-at-yearend/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"see weekend update (opens in a new tab)\">see weekend update</a>) in the 2 year bear trend. Last week is a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. Since it is only a doji bar, it will not attract a lot of buyers above its high.<p>There should be a test of the 12 month bear trend line and of the October high. Both are around 1.20. That is the minimum target over the next 2 months.<p>However, the chart has been sideways for 4 months. The EURUSD is equally likely to first test the bottom of the trading range as it is to test the top.<h3>Bulls will buy new low in 2 year bear channel</h3><p>Even if it falls below the October low, the bulls will buy it. They have bought every reversal up new low for 2 years and it has been a profitable strategy. They will continue to do it until it no longer works.<p>Can the bears get a strong break below the October low? Probably not. There are measured move targets and a gap down around 1.08. No one yet knows if that support will be tested.<p>But traders do know that a break below a bear channel only has a 25% chance of leading to a stronger bear trend. The bears are more likely to take profits at a new low than to sell aggressively below the October low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a small reversal up over the past hour. It is now testing Friday’s high and last week’s high. Last week is a weak buy signal bar on the weekly chart.<p>The bull hope that the 3 week micro double bottom on the weekly chart will be a strong enough base for a 2 – 4 week rally to the October high. Since there has not been a strong bull bar in over 2 weeks on the daily chart, it is probably not enough. Most bulls will therefore wait either for a strong buy signal bar on the daily chart or for a strong bull breakout.<p>Even though traders expect a rally to 1 – 2 to begin soon, there is not yet a strong buy setup on the daily or weekly charts. Bulls are still willing to buy if there is a Bull Surprise Bar on either chart. A good buy signal bar is a more common start to a trend. Consequently, any rally this week will probably just be part of he 3 week trading range and not the start of a move up to 1.12.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-Bear-Trend-From-The-Open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Bear Trend From The Open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The November high might be the start of a 2 week, 50 – 100 point pullback.<p>Today’s selloff was a Bear Surprise Bar on the daily chart. Traders should expect a 2nd leg down, even if there is a bounce over the next week. Every strong bear bar for 2 months had bad follow-through. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a bull bar tomorrow. But the odds favor at least a small 2nd leg down within a couple weeks.<p>This week is now the 1st pullback in a 9 week bull micro channel on the weekly chart. The bulls have been willing to buy above the low of the prior week for 2 months. They now finally have a chance to buy a pullback. Many will take it. Consequently, the pullback will probably not last long nor fall far.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It formed a big bear bar on the daily chart. Even though there was a tail below, it broke below the 2 month bull trend line.<p>Furthermore, the bar was a surprise. A Bear Surprise Bar typically will have a 2nd leg sideways to down. But when it comes in a strong bull trend, there is often a rally to a lower high 1st. The rally can last 5 – 10 bars and be strong. However, traders should still expect a 2nd leg down.<p>Since every bear bar for 2 months had bad follow-through, today is particularly important. Has the market changed its behavior? If today is a 2nd consecutive bear day, especially a big bear day closing on its low, traders will start to conclude that the Emini will pull back for a couple weeks.<p>I said throughout November that a 2 week pullback of 50 – 100 points was likely to begin in November. It might have begun last week.<p>Traders must remember that a strong reversal down will still typically be minor when the bull trend is as strong as this one has been.<p>This week fell below last week’s low. It is now the 1st pullback in 9 weeks on the weekly chart. The bulls have been so aggressive that they were not waiting to buy pullbacks on the weekly chart. They now finally have the opportunity, and many will take it. Consequently, this pullback will probably just last a week or two. Traders should then expect a new high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 23 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open below yesterday’s low. A gap down will form an island top with last week’s gap up. But most island tops and bottoms are minor reversal setups and are no more important than any other reversal pattern.<p>A big gap down increases the chance of a trend day. If there is a trend, a bear trend is more likely.<p>Where there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the EMA. Many bears do not want to sell too far below the average price. That reduces the chance of a big bear trend of the open. They prefer to wait for the Emini to go sideways to up until it gets closer to the EMA. They then look to sell a reversal down from a double top or a wedge rally near the EMA.<p>However, the gap down also means that traders see the price as having been too high. They therefore usually will sell the 1st rally. This increases the chance of a trading range open for the 1st 1 – 2 hours. In addition, early trading range trading reduces the chance of a big trend and it increases the chance of more trading range trading later in the day. Consequently, most big gap opens do not lead to the strongest trends.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-Bear-Trend-From-The-Open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-3.png\" alt=\"Emini Bear Trend From The Open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-bottom-but-in-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-3-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex head and shoulders bottom but in breakout mode\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market formed a big bull bar yesterday. After the strong reversal up from the October nested wedge bottom, traders know that a 2nd leg sideways to up is likely.<p>The bulls hope that yesterday was the start of a reversal up from a head and shoulders bottom. In general, a major trend reversal has a 40% chance of actually leading to a reversal of the trend. More often, the rally ends up as just a bull leg in the trading range.<p>If the bulls get 2 closes above the November 21 high, the rally will probably continue up to the October high and the 14 month bear trend line. That would also be a test of the 1.12 Big Round Number. Two closes above that resistance would then increase the odds of a bull trend on the daily chart, which could last 2 – 3 months.<p>If, however, the EURUSD reverses down, especially from a micro double top, traders will conclude that yesterday’s rally was just like all of the others over the past 2 years. They would then expect an eventual break below the October low.<p>At the moment, yesterday was strong enough to make a test of the October high likely. But if the EURUSD continues to stall here and if it forms a micro double top over the next few days, traders will look for a test back down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 20 pip range overnight. This is bad follow-through for the bulls. A bull trend usually has 2 – 3 consecutive bull trend bars at a time. If today does not close above the November 21 high, traders will suspect that yesterday was simply a test of the top of the 4 week trading range.<p>So far, day traders are scalping. With yesterday being a bull Surprise Bar, today will probably not be a big bear trend day. There is still a chance of a bull trend, but after this much sideways trading overnight, that is unlikely. Today will probably remain a trading range day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-broad-bull-channel-after-big-gap-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini broad bull channel after big gap down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini opened with a big gap down and sold off initially. It then rallied in a broad bull channel for the rest of the day. Today is now a buy signal bar for tomorrow for a 2 day bear trap. A gap up tomorrow will create an island bottom. Today’s gap down formed a 5 day island top.<p>The selloff was strong enough so that a trading range is more likely over the next week. But the bull trend on the daily and weekly charts are strong. Remember, I have been saying for the past month that the buy climax would probably result in a 50 – 100 point pullback that would begin by the end of November. Also, I said it would probably last only a week or two. The pullback began on November 27 and it has fallen about 85 points. It therefore has met my minimum objective.<p>The selloff is strong enough so that the bulls will probably need at least a micro double bottom. That means traders should expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down within a week.<p>But the 2 month rally was strong. Therefore, this 2 day selloff might be a bear trap and the end of the selling. That increases the chance of a strong reversal back up this week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It formed a big bear bar on the daily chart. Even though there was a tail below, it broke below the 2 month bull trend line.<p>Furthermore, the bar was a surprise. A Bear Surprise Bar typically will have a 2nd leg sideways to down. But when it comes in a strong bull trend, there is often a rally to a lower high 1st. The rally can last 5 – 10 bars and be strong. However, traders should still expect a 2nd leg down.<p>Since every bear bar for 2 months had bad follow-through, today is particularly important. Has the market changed its behavior? If today is a 2nd consecutive bear day, especially a big bear day closing on its low, traders will start to conclude that the Emini will pull back for a couple weeks.<p>I said throughout November that a 2 week pullback of 50 – 100 points was likely to begin in November. It might have begun last week.<p>Traders must remember that a strong reversal down will still typically be minor when the bull trend is as strong as this one has been.<p>This week fell below last week’s low. It is now the 1st pullback in 9 weeks on the weekly chart. The bulls have been so aggressive that they were not waiting to buy pullbacks on the weekly chart. They now finally have the opportunity, and many will take it. Consequently, this pullback will probably just last a week or two. Traders should then expect a new high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 23 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open below yesterday’s low. A gap down will form an island top with last week’s gap up. But most island tops and bottoms are minor reversal setups and are no more important than any other reversal pattern.<p>A big gap down increases the chance of a trend day. If there is a trend, a bear trend is more likely.<p>Where there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the EMA. Many bears do not want to sell too far below the average price. That reduces the chance of a big bear trend of the open. They prefer to wait for the Emini to go sideways to up until it gets closer to the EMA. They then look to sell a reversal down from a double top or a wedge rally near the EMA.<p>However, the gap down also means that traders see the price as having been too high. They therefore usually will sell the 1st rally. This increases the chance of a trading range open for the 1st 1 – 2 hours. In addition, early trading range trading reduces the chance of a big trend and it increases the chance of more trading range trading later in the day. Consequently, most big gap opens do not lead to the strongest trends.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-Bear-Trend-From-The-Open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img src=\"2019-12-3.png\" alt=\"Emini Bear Trend From The Open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-bottom-but-in-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-3-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex head and shoulders bottom but in breakout mode\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market formed a big bull bar yesterday. After the strong reversal up from the October nested wedge bottom, traders know that a 2nd leg sideways to up is likely.<p>The bulls hope that yesterday was the start of a reversal up from a head and shoulders bottom. In general, a major trend reversal has a 40% chance of actually leading to a reversal of the trend. More often, the rally ends up as just a bull leg in the trading range.<p>If the bulls get 2 closes above the November 21 high, the rally will probably continue up to the October high and the 14 month bear trend line. That would also be a test of the 1.12 Big Round Number. Two closes above that resistance would then increase the odds of a bull trend on the daily chart, which could last 2 – 3 months.<p>If, however, the EURUSD reverses down, especially from a micro double top, traders will conclude that yesterday’s rally was just like all of the others over the past 2 years. They would then expect an eventual break below the October low.<p>At the moment, yesterday was strong enough to make a test of the October high likely. But if the EURUSD continues to stall here and if it forms a micro double top over the next few days, traders will look for a test back down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 20 pip range overnight. This is bad follow-through for the bulls. A bull trend usually has 2 – 3 consecutive bull trend bars at a time. If today does not close above the November 21 high, traders will suspect that yesterday was simply a test of the top of the 4 week trading range.<p>So far, day traders are scalping. With yesterday being a bull Surprise Bar, today will probably not be a big bear trend day. There is still a chance of a bull trend, but after this much sideways trading overnight, that is unlikely. Today will probably remain a trading range day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-broad-bull-channel-after-big-gap-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini broad bull channel after big gap down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini opened with a big gap down and sold off initially. It then rallied in a broad bull channel for the rest of the day. Today is now a buy signal bar for tomorrow for a 2 day bear trap. A gap up tomorrow will create an island bottom. Today’s gap down formed a 5 day island top.<p>The selloff was strong enough so that a trading range is more likely over the next week. But the bull trend on the daily and weekly charts are strong. Remember, I have been saying for the past month that the buy climax would probably result in a 50 – 100 point pullback that would begin by the end of November. Also, I said it would probably last only a week or two. The pullback began on November 27 and it has fallen about 85 points. It therefore has met my minimum objective.<p>The selloff is strong enough so that the bulls will probably need at least a micro double bottom. That means traders should expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down within a week.<p>But the 2 month rally was strong. Therefore, this 2 day selloff might be a bear trap and the end of the selling. That increases the chance of a strong reversal back up this week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It then rallied in a broad bull channel for the rest of the day. Yesterday is buy signal bar for today on the daily chart. The bulls are hoping that the 2 day selloff will be just a bear trap in a strong bull trend.<p>It is important to remember what I said throughout November. Traders needed to expect a 50 – 100 point, 1 – 2 week correction to begin by the end of November. This was because the buy climax on the daily and weekly charts was extreme. Well, it began on November 27. Yesterday’s low was 85.5 points below the high. This selloff therefore met my minimum goal.<p>It is also important to understand that the weekly chart had been in a 9 bar bull micro channel. That means that this pullback was likely to only last a week or two. It might have ended yesterday, but it probably has a little more sideways to down to go. Can the Emini fall 5 – 8%, like the other pullbacks in 2019? I think the weekly micro channel will result in a smaller pullback.<p>Because many bulls believe the pullback will be brief and the current pullback has been extreme, these bulls are eager to buy. If the Emini begins to reverse up strongly today or this week, everyone might buy in a panic. That could quickly end the selloff.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. If today gaps up, yesterday would be a one day island bottom. Just like the 5 day island top was not a major sell signal, an island bottom is not a major buy signal.<p>The 2 day selloff was extreme. Many bears began to take profits yesterday after a surprising big selloff. Traders are deciding if the profit taking will be enough to resume the bull trend on the daily chart, or if the bears will take control again around 50% up, near Monday’s low.<p>Although yesterday reversed up on the 5 minute, the reversal was not surprisingly strong. That hesitation results in confusion. This adds to he confusion caused by the sharp drop on the daily chart after a strong 2 month rally.<p>Confusion typically takes time before the path becomes clear. Therefore, the Emini will probably soon go sideways for a few days. If it does, the 5 minute chart will have a lot of trading range price action.<p>Less likely, yesterday will be a one day bear flag and the bear trend will resume. Or, yesterday will be the start of a climactic reversal up, like what happened at the end of December last year.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-broad-bull-channel-after-big-gap-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-4.png\" alt=\"Emini broad bull channel after big gap down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But the rally has stalled at the November 21 lower high for 2 days.<p>The bears want a double top bear flag and then a break below the 4 week trading range. A measured move down would result in another new low in the 2 year bear channel.<p>The 4 week trading range has both a double bottom and a double top. Traders are deciding on the direction of the breakout. Because the October rally was so strong, a 2nd leg up to 1.12 is more likely than a reversal down to below 1.09. But not much more likely. The EURUSD would not be going sideways if the bulls were clearly in control.<p>In a trading range, bulls take partial or full profits near the top and the bears begin to sell. At the bottom, the bears start to take profits and the bulls begin to buy. There is no evidence yet that this is changing. However, the odds still slightly favor the bulls over the next month or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 30 pip range overnight. The bulls want a breakout above the November 21 high. Because the chart is in Breakout Mode, there is an increased chance of a strong trend up or down. But until there is a breakout, day traders will be quick to take profits. The result would then be a continuation of yesterday’s trading range.<p>The bulls also want the week to close near its high. This week would then be a credible buy signal bar for next week on the weekly chart.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-parabolic-wedge-top-and-then-late-trend-reversal-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge top and then late trend reversal down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

These are minor reversal patterns.<p>Last week was a bad sell signal bar on the weekly chart. Therefore traders bought below its low and scaled in lower. They were confident that the Emini would get back to at least 1 tick above last week’s low. They achieved their goal today. They were able to exit their 1st long at breakeven and they made a profit on their lower buy.<p>While yesterday and today rallied, both days had tails on top on the daily chart. In addition, both had a lot of trading range price action. This increases the chance for more tomorrow. Furthermore, it increases the chance of a few sideways days starting this week.

Last week was a bull bar on the weekly chart and therefore a bad sell signal bar. Some bulls theoretically bought below its low and scaled in lower. They were confident that any selloff would come back to last week’s low. It did yesterday.<p>The bulls are hoping that the rally will continue up to the all-time high. However, the selloff was strong enough to make at least a 2nd leg sideways to down likely.<p>Also, the Emini is back in the 6 day tight trading range from 2 weeks ago. Furthermore, the past 2 bull days had prominent tails on top on the daily chart. It therefore might go sideways here for a few days. Additionally, the Emini might go sideways into the December 15 China tariff announcement.<p>The 2 day rally was not particularly strong on the 5 minute chart. It looks more like a bull leg in a trading range than a resumption of a bull trend. There was a lot of trading range price action during both days. Day traders will expect more trading range price action again today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. Traders are debating whether the 2 day rally is a resumption of the 2 month bull trend or a pullback in a new bear trend. They might need a few days to decide.<p>The Emini has retraced about half of the selloff. In addition, it’s back to the middle of the range of the past 4 weeks. Finally, there was a lot of trading range price action over the past 2 days. These factors make more sideways trading on the daily chart likely.<p>Additionally, they make more trading range price action on the 5 minute chart likely. Day traders will expect trends to be brief and have bad follow-through. In addition, there should again be many reversals.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-parabolic-wedge-top-and-then-late-trend-reversal-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-5.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge top and then late trend reversal down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-and-double-bottom-in-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-5-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small trading range for a month. There is both a double top and a double bottom. This range is within a bigger 5 month trading range. The EURUSD Forex market is in breakout mode.<p>Since the October rally was the strongest in 2 years, traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. It is possible that the double top over the past 3 weeks is all that they will get. It is more common for the 2nd leg to get at least up to the top of the 1st leg. Consequently, traders expect a test of 1.12, the October highs, and the 14 month bear trend line.<p>Furthermore, even if the bears succeed in getting a breakout to a new low, traders will buy it. They have bought every new low in the 2 year bear channel and will do it again. Therefore, the downside is limited over the next month.<p>Unfortunately for the bulls, the upside is small as well. This is because the monthly chart has been in a tight bear channel. The 1st breakout above a tight bull channel is usually minor.<p>That means it usually leads to a trading range before it can become a bull trend. Traders should expect a continuation of the 5 months of sideways trading for at least another month.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been within a 25 pip range overnight. It has not broken out of yesterday’s range. Today is a small inside day so far. In addition, it is the 3rd consecutive sideways day. Day traders are scalping, looking for reversals.<p>Because the EURUSD is at the top of its month-long range, a breakout up or down can come at any time. The quite overnight trading makes it unlikely to come today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

For example, the bulls tested it on the open today and again late in the day. It will continue to be important tomorrow, especially in the final hour. The bulls want the week to close above last week’s low as a sign of strength.

However, the bears were unable to break below Wednesday’s low to create an outside down day. Instead, the bulls got a reversal up and a rally that lasted the rest of the day.<p>I have been saying all week that last week’s low would be a magnet on Friday. Well, today is Friday. I said it because last week had a bull body. It was therefore a bad sell signal bar on the weekly chart, given a 9 week bull micro channel. That means there would probably be more buyers than sellers below.<p>This was true, despite the 2 day selloff. As a sign of strength, the bulls would try to get the week to close above last week’s low. They want a close above the entry price for the bears. Furthermore, they would like today to close above the open of the week, reversing the entire selloff.<p>The bears wanted a big bear bar closing on its low on the weekly chart. Now, they are desperate to simply get the week to close even slightly below last week’s low.<p>With last week’s low being important to both the bulls and the bears, it might be a magnet again today. This is especially true in the final hour of today. The other key price is the open of the week. The bulls want the week to close above the open.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap up again today. Furthermore, it is now only 6 points below the open of the week. That is close enough to be a magnet today.<p>The 4 day rally has reversed the 2 day selloff. A big gap up increases the chance of a trend day. If there is a trend, up is more likely than down.<p>However, The bulls might be satisfied with a close around the open or high of the week. If so, there might not be much of a rally today.<p>Their next objective would be to close the week above last week’s high. This week would then be an outside up week. But even if they achieved that, today would probably not close much above last week’s high. That high is only 18 points above the current Globex price. Therefore, if today is a bull trend day, it will probably not be a huge bull trend day.<p>Can today trend down? Last week’s low is still a magnet below. With the surprisingly strong rally over the past 30 minutes, and the Emini now getting close to the open of the week, a bear trend day is unlikely. Consequently, today will probably be sideways to up. With most days spending a lot of time going sideways, today likely will as well, even if there is a trend.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Today triggered the High 1 bull flag buy signal by going above yesterday’s high.<p>But, it reversed down from only 2 pips above yesterday’s high. Also, it just broke below yesterday’s low after the US unemployment report. The buy signal is failing. That was likely since the EURUSD has been unable to successfully break above the November 21 high several times over the past 4 days. Today is now an outside down day.<p>The bears would like today to close below yesterday’s low and near the low of the day. Today would then be a reasonable sell signal bar for a double top with that high. However, will the bears get a reversal down from here or will the 4 day tight trading range continue? The odds are about the same for both.<h3>Will the next week be up or down?</h3><p>They odds are probably a little better for a test of 1.2 than a break below the October low over the next few weeks. This is because the October rally was strong enough to get a 2nd leg up, and there is good resistance there. Resistance is a magnet, and the EURUSD is close enough so that it probably cannot resist the magnetic pull. The magnets are the bear trend line, the October high, and the 1.12 Big Round Number.<p>The bears want a break below the November 29 low. That is the neck line of the double top and the bottom of the 4 week trading range. They then want a strong break below the October low. They would then have a new low in their 2 year bear channel.<p>But even if they achieved their goals, the bulls would buy the bear breakouts. This has been a profitable strategy for 2 years and they are confident that they would get a 200 – 300 pip rally, like they did after every prior new low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above yesterday’s high and it just broke below yesterday’s low. Today is therefore an outside down day.<p>However, it bounced up from below yesterday’s low and the bottom of the 4 day tight trading range.<p>The 2 reversals over the past hour increase the chance that today will remain a trading range day. Since the most recent reversal was down and the daily chart is at resistance, if there is a trend today, down is more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-then-consecutive-wedge-tops.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend then consecutive wedge tops\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini gapped up and rallied in a Small Pullback Bull trend. The rally stalled between the open of the week and the high of last week. At the end of the day, the Emini pulled back to the open of the week. This week is now a doji bar on the weekly chart.<p>The bulls have reversed Monday and Tuesday’s selloff and now traders are wondering if they will get a new high. The reversal up was strong this week and the daily, weekly, and monthly charts are in strong bull trends. However, the rally did not break above last week’s high. The bears therefore will try to create a double top.<p>The momentum up favors the bulls. The bears will probably need at least a few sideways days before they have a reasonable chance of a reversal down from a double top. Therefore, the next few days will probably be either sideways or up.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, the bears were unable to break below Wednesday’s low to create an outside down day. Instead, the bulls got a reversal up and a rally that lasted the rest of the day.<p>I have been saying all week that last week’s low would be a magnet on Friday. Well, today is Friday. I said it because last week had a bull body. It was therefore a bad sell signal bar on the weekly chart, given a 9 week bull micro channel. That means there would probably be more buyers than sellers below.<p>This was true, despite the 2 day selloff. As a sign of strength, the bulls would try to get the week to close above last week’s low. They want a close above the entry price for the bears. Furthermore, they would like today to close above the open of the week, reversing the entire selloff.<p>The bears wanted a big bear bar closing on its low on the weekly chart. Now, they are desperate to simply get the week to close even slightly below last week’s low.<p>With last week’s low being important to both the bulls and the bears, it might be a magnet again today. This is especially true in the final hour of today. The other key price is the open of the week. The bulls want the week to close above the open.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap up again today. Furthermore, it is now only 6 points below the open of the week. That is close enough to be a magnet today.<p>The 4 day rally has reversed the 2 day selloff. A big gap up increases the chance of a trend day. If there is a trend, up is more likely than down.<p>However, The bulls might be satisfied with a close around the open or high of the week. If so, there might not be much of a rally today.<p>Their next objective would be to close the week above last week’s high. This week would then be an outside up week. But even if they achieved that, today would probably not close much above last week’s high. That high is only 18 points above the current Globex price. Therefore, if today is a bull trend day, it will probably not be a huge bull trend day.<p>Can today trend down? Last week’s low is still a magnet below. With the surprisingly strong rally over the past 30 minutes, and the Emini now getting close to the open of the week, a bear trend day is unlikely. Consequently, today will probably be sideways to up. With most days spending a lot of time going sideways, today likely will as well, even if there is a trend.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img src=\"2019-12-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-and-double-bottom-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-6-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top and double bottom in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a bull inside day yesterday in a swing up. Today triggered the High 1 bull flag buy signal by going above yesterday’s high.<p>But, it reversed down from only 2 pips above yesterday’s high. Also, it just broke below yesterday’s low after the US unemployment report. The buy signal is failing. That was likely since the EURUSD has been unable to successfully break above the November 21 high several times over the past 4 days. Today is now an outside down day.<p>The bears would like today to close below yesterday’s low and near the low of the day. Today would then be a reasonable sell signal bar for a double top with that high. However, will the bears get a reversal down from here or will the 4 day tight trading range continue? The odds are about the same for both.<h3>Will the next week be up or down?</h3><p>They odds are probably a little better for a test of 1.2 than a break below the October low over the next few weeks. This is because the October rally was strong enough to get a 2nd leg up, and there is good resistance there. Resistance is a magnet, and the EURUSD is close enough so that it probably cannot resist the magnetic pull. The magnets are the bear trend line, the October high, and the 1.12 Big Round Number.<p>The bears want a break below the November 29 low. That is the neck line of the double top and the bottom of the 4 week trading range. They then want a strong break below the October low. They would then have a new low in their 2 year bear channel.<p>But even if they achieved their goals, the bulls would buy the bear breakouts. This has been a profitable strategy for 2 years and they are confident that they would get a 200 – 300 pip rally, like they did after every prior new low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above yesterday’s high and it just broke below yesterday’s low. Today is therefore an outside down day.<p>However, it bounced up from below yesterday’s low and the bottom of the 4 day tight trading range.<p>The 2 reversals over the past hour increase the chance that today will remain a trading range day. Since the most recent reversal was down and the daily chart is at resistance, if there is a trend today, down is more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-then-consecutive-wedge-tops.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend then consecutive wedge tops\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The rally stalled between the open of the week and the high of last week. At the end of the day, the Emini pulled back to the open of the week. This week is now a doji bar on the weekly chart.<p>The bulls have reversed Monday and Tuesday’s selloff and now traders are wondering if they will get a new high. The reversal up was strong this week and the daily, weekly, and monthly charts are in strong bull trends. However, the rally did not break above last week’s high. The bears therefore will try to create a double top.<p>The momentum up favors the bulls. The bears will probably need at least a few sideways days before they have a reasonable chance of a reversal down from a double top. Therefore, the next few days will probably be either sideways or up.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bears now want a double top, but sideways to up is more likely.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are drifting down from a buy climax. They will probably be sideways to down for many months.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is in a 4 day tight trading range in the middle of a 5 month trading range. More sideways price action is likely.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Weak reversal down from buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Treasury-bond-futures-turning-down-from-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-7.png\" alt=\"Treasury bond futures turning down from wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures reversed down from a yearlong parabolic wedge top in September on the monthly chart. September and October were consecutive inside bars. They formed an ii (inside-inside) sell signal. November triggered the sell signal when it traded below the October low.<p>However, the bond market has been sideways since August. While the sell setup was credible, both inside bars had big tails below. They represent traders buying dips. The November entry bar also had a big tail below. In addition, November closed above the October low, despite the big selloff early in November. This is not how bear trends typically begin.<p>When a parabolic wedge rally is very tight, like this on, the reversal usually is more of a pause than a reversal. The pause sometimes lasts 10 or more bars. Since this is a monthly chart, it could go sideways in a tight range for a year.<h3>Bull flag or developing top?</h3><p>The bulls see the 4 month pullback as a bull flag. And it is. But 3 or 4 bear bars makes it a weak buy setup.<p>Also, there was a nested wedge top in 2016. That is a reliable pattern. I have been saying that a trend reversal on the monthly chart can take years. Even though August broke above the top of the 2016 nested wedge, it is still more likely just part of the topping process than a sign that the top will fail.<p>Americans will not tolerate negative interest rates.<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"I talked about this several times.  (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\">I talked about this several times.</a>That limits how far up bond futures can realistically go (low rates mean high bond prices). While they have not yet begun to go down, it is much more likely that they will eventually go down before continuing up much higher.<p>But the bears might need to stop the bulls for a year or more before they are able to take control. In the meantime, traders will expect a continuation of the 4 month trading range.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Weak rally after higher low major trend reversal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-chart-has-micro-double-bottom-and-micro-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-7-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly chart has micro double bottom and micro double top\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart reversed up this week from a small higher low. But last week was only a doji bar, which is a weak buy signal bar. Although this week had a bull body, there was a big tail on top. Therefore, the EURUSD will probably stay in its 4 week trading range for at least another week.<p>Since the October rally was the strongest rally on the weekly chart in 2 years, the bulls expect a 2nd leg up. This is especially true since the reversal up on October 1 was from a nested wedge bottom. The bulls hope that this week was the start of that 2nd leg up. However, sideways is more likely than up for next week.<p>The 1st target for the bulls is the October 21 high, which was the top of the 1st leg up. It is also around other targets, like the 15 month bear trend line and the 1.12 Big Round Number.<h3>What about the bears?</h3><p>The EURUSD has been forming a series of new lows for 2 years. Traders have been selling every 2 – 3 week rally, betting that each would be a bull leg in the bear channel.<p>This has been a very good strategy. The bears will continue to sell 200 – 300 pip rallies until they believe that the bear trend has ended.<p>One sign of that would be if the bulls get consecutive closes above a major lower high. Is the October high major enough? For some computers, yes.<p>A more important lower high is the June 25 high of 1.1413. If the bulls get 2 closes above that high, traders will conclude that the bear trend has ended. They would then look at the chart as being in either a trading range or a bull trend.<h3>The bulls will keep buying new lows in bear channel</h3><p>What happens if the bears get a reversal down from the October high? Not much. The bulls have been fearlessly buying every new low for 2 years. They know that trends weaken as the age. That will make the bulls more willing to below below the October low or on a reversal up from the October low.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Doji bar in strong rally</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-testing-top-of-13-year-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart testing top of 13 year bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;is forming a doji bar in December. The bears want the month to close on its low. It would then be a credible sell signal bar for a wedge rally in 2019 and for a reversal down from the top of the 13 year bull channel. At the moment, this is unlikely.<p>The year has been in a tight bull channel, despite the wedge rally. When a tight bull channel reverses, the reversal is usually minor. Consequently, the best the bears can probably get over the next couple months is a pullback and not a bear trend.<p>Yes, 2019 was in a tight bull channel. That is good for the bulls. But look at the bars. Many of the bull bars had prominent tails below and several others were dojis or bear bars.<p>When a rally looks like that, it typically will end up being a bull leg in a trading range. That means that there would be a bear leg within maybe 5 bars. But 5 bars is 5 months, and the Emini could go considerably higher in the meantime. The bottom of the developing range is the 2019 low at around 2400. If there is a bear leg, that becomes a reasonable target later next year.<h3>Rally will probably soon evolve into a trading range</h3><p>As I said, a tight bull channel usually does not reverse into a bear trend. More often, it first has to stop going up and begin to go sideways. At that point, the bears will try to create a double top or a micro double top. If they get that, they then will have a better chance of a bear trend.<p>Since this is a monthly chart, several sideways bars means several months. As a result, the downside risk over the next few months is not great.<p>But, remember, this rally looks like a leg in what will become a trading range. Therefore the upside potential from here is also not big. Traders should expect mostly sideways bars for a few months. That means maybe a bar or two down or a bar or two up, but not a strong trend either way.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Doji bar after 1st pullback in 9 bar bull micro channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-stalling-at-top-of-yearlong-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-7-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart stalling at top of yearlong bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had been in a micro channel until this week. Once this week traded below last week’s low, this week became the 1st pullback in 9 weeks. It therefore ended the micro channel.<p>A micro channel means that the bulls were so eager to buy that they were buying above the prior week’s low. They were not waiting for a pullback. Once they finally get a pullback, they typically buy it. That is what happened this week. Despite the strong selloff on Monday and Tuesday, the bulls bought. The rally completely retraced the selloff at the start of the week. Traders should expect either a trading range or slightly higher prices over the next few weeks.<h3>Last week’s bad sell signal bar meant buyers below</h3><p>For the bears, last week was a sell signal bar for a reversal down from the top of a yearlong bear channel. That channel is different from the monthly bull channel, which is 13 years long. It is also different from the 2 month bull channel on the daily chart.<p>Yes, last week was a sell signal bar on the weekly chart, but it had a bull body. That is a weak sell signal bar. In addition, the context is bad for the bears. Traders know that the bulls would buy the 1st pullback. As a result, I said last week that this was a weak sell setup and that there would probably be more buyers than sellers below last week’s low.<p>Many of the bulls who bought last week’s low knew that the selloff might fall 100 points. They scaled in lower. Since last week was a bad sell signal bar, a bull buying below last week’s low, scaling in lower, and using a wide stop had an 80% chance of not losing money, and a very good chance of making money.<p>When the rally went back above last week’s low on Wednesday, those bulls could exit their 1st buy at breakeven. They could exit their lower buy with a profit.<h3>High 1 bull flag, but doji bar</h3><p>The bulls bought aggressively this week and retraced Monday and Tuesday’s selloff. The week closed around the open and it was a doji bar on the weekly chart. It was a brief pause in a bull trend. However, this week is still a buy signal bar for next week. It is a High 1 bull flag.<p>But a doji is not a strong buy signal bar. Many bulls will prefer to buy another pullback instead of buying at the high. There might be a relative lack of bulls buying above this week’s high. Consequently, a rally above this week’s high might not get too far. That doji bar increases the chance of some sideways trading over the next week or two.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong reversal back up after break below 2 month bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-bull-trend-resumption-after-bear-trap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-7-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart bull trend resumption after bear trap\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke strongly below the 2 month tight bull channel this week. However, it also reversed up strongly. This is a small version of what took place last Christmas. There was a huge selloff, but it was a bear trap. The bulls bought it aggressively and got a strong bull trend for all of 2019. But this bear trap is less certain because it is at the top of a buy climax and not at the bottom of a sell climax.<h3>Problems for the bulls</h3><p>The bulls once again are hoping that this week’s selloff was another bear trap. They want the 2 month bull trend to quickly resume and for the year to close at a new high.<p>But there are problems with their reversal up. The buy signal bar on Tuesday was not especially big. Wednesday was the entry bar and it was only a small bull bar. Also, it had a prominent tail on top. Thursday was the follow-through bar and it had a bear body. Friday was good, but it did not break strongly above last week’s all-time high. Traders will wonder about a double top, especially if the Emini stalls here for a few days. If there is a reversal down within a few days after a new high, there would be an expanding triangle top.<h3>Problems for the bears</h3><p>The bears got a big bear bar on Monday and a gap down on Tuesday. The selloff broke far below the 2 month bull channel. A strong reversal down from a climactic rally typically has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>However, the Emini completely retraced the selloff. Very often, a break below a trend line forms a higher low. Traders then redraw the line. The result is a broader, less steep bull channel. But it is still a bull trend, and not the reversal down that the bears wanted.<p>Next, the 2 month rally was in a tight bull channel. A tight bull channel does not typically immediately break into a bear trend. There is usually a transition in which the market goes sideways for at least 5 – 10 bars. The bears are hoping that this week’s reversal up will be part of that transition. They need a double top with last week’s high.<h3>Who will win?</h3><p>With problems for both the bulls and the bears, which side will take control? In general, a strong reversal down from a buy climax has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>However, when there is a surprisingly big selloff like we saw on Monday and Tuesday, there is often a strong rally back up. Many bulls see the selloff as overdone and they buy what the believe is a brief discount. Many bears are surprised to quickly get a big profit and they buy back some or all of their shorts. This buying by both the bulls and the bears often reverses most or all of the initial selloff. That is what we saw this week.<p>The momentum up this week favors the bulls. So does the strong bull trend on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. If the bears can get the Emini to go sideways for a few days, they will have a 40% chance of a reversal down to last week’s low. But, they only have a 30% chance of a strong break below that low and then a measured move down. For them, there will be a double top. However, a trading range is still more likely than a trend reversal down.<p>If there is a 2nd leg down, can it grow into a bear trend? Unlikely. With the bull trend as strong as it has been on the weekly and monthly charts, the odds favor sideways to up over the next month or two.<p>The Emini will probably have to go sideways for at least a couple months before the bears could have a good chance of creating a bear trend. Consequently, the odds continue to favor sideways to up.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

I said throughout November that a 50 – 100 point pullback was likely, and last week probably was it. The bulls want a resumption of the bull trend through the rest of the year. However, the bears want a double top with the high of 2 weeks ago.<p>Since the Emini raced up to that high and not far above, it might pause here for a few days. This is especially true with the uncertainty over Wednesday’s FOMC announcement. However, the odds still favor higher prices over the next month or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 3 points in the Globex session. The 4 day rally was not especially strong. Traders wonder if it was simply a buy vacuum test of the all-time high from 2 weeks ago. The bears want a double top and then a reversal down.<p>However, the bulls see last week’s selloff as a bear trap. They want a break to a new all-time high. Furthermore, they want the year to close on its high.<p>The momentum up on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts gives the bulls a slight advantage over the remaining weeks of 2019.

I said throughout November that a 50 – 100 point pullback was likely, and last week probably was it. The bulls want a resumption of the bull trend through the rest of the year. However, the bears want a double top with the high of 2 weeks ago.<p>Since the Emini raced up to that high and not far above, it might pause here for a few days. This is especially true with the uncertainty over Wednesday’s FOMC announcement. However, the odds still favor higher prices over the next month or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 3 points in the Globex session. The 4 day rally was not especially strong. Traders wonder if it was simply a buy vacuum test of the all-time high from 2 weeks ago. The bears want a double top and then a reversal down.<p>However, the bulls see last week’s selloff as a bear trap. They want a break to a new all-time high. Furthermore, they want the year to close on its high.<p>The momentum up on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts gives the bulls a slight advantage over the remaining weeks of 2019.

The bears are hoping that Friday will form a double top with that high. Today is a sell signal bar for the double top.<p>Last week’s big bear bar on Monday was a Bear Surprise Bar. Traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to down. This is true even when there is a rally back to above the top of the Bear Surprise Bar, like on Friday. While that lowers the probability of the 2nd leg down, the bears still have a 50% chance, especially with the potential of a big move up or down after tomorrow’s FOMC news.<p>The bulls see last week as a bear trap. They expect a new all-time high and they want the year to close on its high. However, their reversal up is stalling at the high from 2 weeks ago. Traders are deciding between the breakout and the double top. They might wait for Wednesday’s FOMC announcement before creating a breakout up or down.<p>Both Friday and yesterday were small and had mostly trading range price action. That increases the chance of more sideways trading today. But the odds continue to at least slightly favor higher prices over the next month.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. However, it sold off overnight and reversed up 25 points over the past 2 hours. This increases the chance of a continued reversal up in the day session today.<p>Also, there were two ledges yesterday around 3145. A ledge is 4 or more bars in a tight trading range with exactly the same high. It is a strong magnet and the Emini usually goes above the ledge later in the day or on the next day. Those ledges further increase the chance of a continuation of the Globex rally today.<p>Tomorrow’s FOMC announcement is a potential surprise. Markets tend to get neutral ahead of surprises. The Emini has been sideways for 2 days. It therefore might already be neutral.<p>Furthermore, there has been a lot of trading range price action over the past 5 days. Day traders should expect more trading range price action, even though there will probably be a rally to above the 3145 ledge tops.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-buy-climax-and-double-top-then-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-10.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax and double top then small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

When you look at it, there is no sense that the price is terribly wrong and it needs to quickly move up or down to a more fair price. It is in the middle of a 5 week trading range, and that range is in the middle of a 5 month trading range.<p>The bears are hoping for a reversal down from last week’s failed breakout of the top of the range. But the sell signal bar 3 days ago was weak and there was no follow-through selling after the one day reversal down.<p>The bulls hope that Friday’s selloff was just a pullback from what they hope will be successful breakout above the range. However, the breakout was small and yesterday was a weak buy signal bar.<p>The October rally was strong enough to have a 2nd leg sideways to up. So far, the 2nd leg is sideways.<p>The bear trend line is now below the October high. That is one of the targets, and the EURUSD can get there by simply continuing sideways. That would achieve the minimum goal for the bulls after their October 1 nested wedge bottom.<p>Traders are waiting for a sign that either the bulls or bears are taking control. In the meantime, they are looking for 1 – 3 day trades and betting on a continuation of the range. Upcoming potential catalysts for a breakout are tomorrow’s FOMC announcement, this weekend’s China tariff decision, and, most importantly, clarity on Brexit.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to above yesterday’s high overnight. That triggered a buy signal on the daily chart for a reversal up from Friday’s pullback.<p>However, today only went 6 pips above yesterday’s high and it then pulled back below the high. In addition, yesterday was only a doji bar, which is a weak buy signal bar. Finally, the overnight range has only been 22 pips. Consequently, day traders are continuing to look for reversals and 10 pips scalps as they wait for a breakout up or down. There is no sign yet that one will come today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-sell-climax-the-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax the trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It closed near the open and therefore today is not a strong buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Tomorrow’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement is the final one of the decade. It could lead to a big move up or down. But even if the Emini sells off for a few days, the bull trend on the weekly chart is strong.

When you look at it, there is no sense that the price is terribly wrong and it needs to quickly move up or down to a more fair price. It is in the middle of a 5 week trading range, and that range is in the middle of a 5 month trading range.<p>The bears are hoping for a reversal down from last week’s failed breakout of the top of the range. But the sell signal bar 3 days ago was weak and there was no follow-through selling after the one day reversal down.<p>The bulls hope that Friday’s selloff was just a pullback from what they hope will be successful breakout above the range. However, the breakout was small and yesterday was a weak buy signal bar.<p>The October rally was strong enough to have a 2nd leg sideways to up. So far, the 2nd leg is sideways.<p>The bear trend line is now below the October high. That is one of the targets, and the EURUSD can get there by simply continuing sideways. That would achieve the minimum goal for the bulls after their October 1 nested wedge bottom.<p>Traders are waiting for a sign that either the bulls or bears are taking control. In the meantime, they are looking for 1 – 3 day trades and betting on a continuation of the range. Upcoming potential catalysts for a breakout are tomorrow’s FOMC announcement, this weekend’s China tariff decision, and, most importantly, clarity on Brexit.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to above yesterday’s high overnight. That triggered a buy signal on the daily chart for a reversal up from Friday’s pullback.<p>However, today only went 6 pips above yesterday’s high and it then pulled back below the high. In addition, yesterday was only a doji bar, which is a weak buy signal bar. Finally, the overnight range has only been 22 pips. Consequently, day traders are continuing to look for reversals and 10 pips scalps as they wait for a breakout up or down. There is no sign yet that one will come today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-sell-climax-the-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax the trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It could lead to a big move up or down. But even if the Emini sells off for a few days, the bull trend on the weekly chart is strong.

Yesterday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. The bulls expect higher prices and they want the year to close on its high. This is true even if there is a sharp selloff for a few days after today’s final FOMC announcement of the decade.<p>The bears hope that this week is forming a double top with the high from 2 weeks ago. Last week’s low is the neck line. They want a break below the neck line and then a 85 point measured move down from there.<p>Because the daily, weekly, and monthly charts are in strong bull trends, the bull case is more likely. Even if the bears get a selloff on today’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement, the Emini will probably make a new high within a month or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 2 points in the Globex session. It has had mostly trading range price action for 6 days. Traders will expect the same today ahead of the 11 am PST FOMC announcement.<p>Day traders should get flat ahead of the report. There is typically a quick move up and down immediately after the report. There is then a 50% chance of a swing up or a swing down. Day traders should wait for at least 10 minutes after the report before resuming trading. They should wait to see consecutive strong trend bars up or down before taking a position.<p>The Emini can do anything after an FOMC report. It can trend in either or both directions, have multiple reversals, or simply go sideways. Never have an opinion going into the report and never listen to a TV expert if you want to make money. Simply trade what you see after the report. If the bars are big, the risk is big. Only trade if you can trade small enough so that your risk is no more than at any other time.<p>There were 2 ledge tops at around 3145 on Monday. These typically get tested by the close of the next day. Since the Emini did not get there yesterday and it is still near those magnets, it will probably get there today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-sell-climax-the-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-11.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax the trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The Emini has been sideways for 4 days. That increases the chance of more sideways trading again today.<p>Last week’s candlestick is a High 1 buy signal bar on the weekly chart. The bulls want to trigger the buy signal and then have the year to close at a new high.<p>However, the bears hope for a reversal down from a double top with the high of 2 weeks ago. Since the bull trend is strong on the weekly chart, the bulls have a higher probability of success. This is true even if the bears first get a selloff to around last week’s low. Yesterday is not giving day traders a sign that today will be the start of the breakout or of a reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 5 points in the Globex session. Traders are deciding if the 7 day rally will continue to trend up for the rest of the year. The bears want a double top with the high from 2 weeks ago and then a trend down.<p>But the past 7 days have all been small and had lots of trading range price action. That means the odds are against a strong trend day today. Since markets have inertia, day traders will expect at least one reversal again today. Because the Emini is at a critical price, if there is a trend up or down, it could be relentless, but a trading range is more likely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-after-FOMC-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-12.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption after FOMC\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-2nd-leg-up-in-trading-range-ahead-of-Brexit-vote.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-12-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex 2nd leg up in trading range ahead of Brexit vote\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up from a nested wedge bottom on October 1. The October rally and the wedge bottom made a 2nd leg sideways to up likely.<p>That leg began on November 29. The minimum target was the 14 month bear trend line, which today is only 17 pips above today’s high.<p>The rally will probably continue up to the October 31 high. At that point, traders will have a decision to make. Will the rally end near the top of the 5 month trading range? Will there be a reversal down to the middle or bottom of the range? Or, will the higher low major trend reversal on the weekly chart actually lead to a reversal up into a bull trend?<p>Major reversals lead to trends 40% of the time. Consequently, a continuation of the trading range is more likely.<p>However, a 2 year pullback from a rally (the yearlong rally from January 2017 low) is becoming unusual. Therefore, traders know that a sustained rally is becoming increasingly likely. If the bulls can get 2 closes above the June high, the rally will probably continue up to the September 2018 high. That was the start of the tight bear channel on the weekly chart and it is therefore a magnet.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a rally yesterday, but it has been in a 20 pip range overnight. The 5 month bear trend line is only 17 pips above today’s high and it is a strong magnet. Traders therefore expect the EURUSD to get there within a few days by either going up or sideways. That reduces the chance of a big bear day this week.<p>However, even though the EURUSD has rallied in its 2nd leg up for 10 days, the rally has not been particularly strong. For example, it is weaker that the 1st leg up which began on October 1. It therefore looks more like a leg in the 5 month trading range than the start of a bull trend.

The Emini has been sideways for 4 days. That increases the chance of more sideways trading again today.<p>Last week’s candlestick is a High 1 buy signal bar on the weekly chart. The bulls want to trigger the buy signal and then have the year to close at a new high.<p>However, the bears hope for a reversal down from a double top with the high of 2 weeks ago. Since the bull trend is strong on the weekly chart, the bulls have a higher probability of success. This is true even if the bears first get a selloff to around last week’s low. Yesterday is not giving day traders a sign that today will be the start of the breakout or of a reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 5 points in the Globex session. Traders are deciding if the 7 day rally will continue to trend up for the rest of the year. The bears want a double top with the high from 2 weeks ago and then a trend down.<p>But the past 7 days have all been small and had lots of trading range price action. That means the odds are against a strong trend day today. Since markets have inertia, day traders will expect at least one reversal again today. Because the Emini is at a critical price, if there is a trend up or down, it could be relentless, but a trading range is more likely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-after-FOMC-3.png\"><img src=\"2019-12-12.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption after FOMC\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-2nd-leg-up-in-trading-range-ahead-of-Brexit-vote.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-12-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex 2nd leg up in trading range ahead of Brexit vote\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up from a nested wedge bottom on October 1. The October rally and the wedge bottom made a 2nd leg sideways to up likely.<p>That leg began on November 29. The minimum target was the 14 month bear trend line, which today is only 17 pips above today’s high.<p>The rally will probably continue up to the October 31 high. At that point, traders will have a decision to make. Will the rally end near the top of the 5 month trading range? Will there be a reversal down to the middle or bottom of the range? Or, will the higher low major trend reversal on the weekly chart actually lead to a reversal up into a bull trend?<p>Major reversals lead to trends 40% of the time. Consequently, a continuation of the trading range is more likely.<p>However, a 2 year pullback from a rally (the yearlong rally from January 2017 low) is becoming unusual. Therefore, traders know that a sustained rally is becoming increasingly likely. If the bulls can get 2 closes above the June high, the rally will probably continue up to the September 2018 high. That was the start of the tight bear channel on the weekly chart and it is therefore a magnet.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a rally yesterday, but it has been in a 20 pip range overnight. The 5 month bear trend line is only 17 pips above today’s high and it is a strong magnet. Traders therefore expect the EURUSD to get there within a few days by either going up or sideways. That reduces the chance of a big bear day this week.<p>However, even though the EURUSD has rallied in its 2nd leg up for 10 days, the rally has not been particularly strong. For example, it is weaker that the 1st leg up which began on October 1. It therefore looks more like a leg in the 5 month trading range than the start of a bull trend. That reduces the chance of a 3rd consecutive bull trend day today. Day traders have been scalping small reversals overnight.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bull-major-surprise-breakout-above-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull major surprise breakout above bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was the 1st pullback in a 9 week bull micro channel. A pullback in a bull trend is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. The bulls triggered the weekly buy signal yesterday by going above last week’s high.<p>After a huge rally to just above the top of the 13 week bull channel, the Emini reversed relentlessly down. The selloff fell back below last week’s high. When there is a buy signal on a higher time frame chart, there is usually a pullback to below the entry price.<p>Yesterday’s Big Up, Big Down created Big Confusion. That is a hallmark of a trading range. It increases the chance of trading range price action today.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the top of the 13 year bull channel. More likely, today will be a trading range day and oscillate around last week’s high. In the final hour, either last week’s high or yesterday’s high (the top of the 13 year bull channel) will probably be a magnet.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a strong bull trend for the 1st half of the day. There was profit taking for the rest of the day. That created a trading range. There is no sign that the trading range price action is changing in the Globex session. Day traders will expect it to continue today.<p>Since today is Friday, weekly support and resistance are important. The 2 most important prices are the high of the week and the high of last week. The bears have only a small chance of the week closing on its low.<p>The bulls want today to trend up and have the week close on its high. However, the Emini is more likely to continue yesterday’s trading range and close well below the high and possibly back near the open of the week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bull-major-surprise-breakout-above-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-13.png\" alt=\"Emini bull major surprise breakout above bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls got their 2nd leg up. There was a break above the bear trend line and the October high. Finally, today reached the 1.12 Big Round Number.<p>What happens next? At 3 months, this rally is the longest rally in 2 year bear trend. That bear trend is probably a bull flag on the monthly chart. The bulls are hoping that the 2017 bull trend is resuming.<p>But the bear trend that began in February 2018 was a Bear Spike and Channel. That usually evolves into a trading range. Traders expect a rally up to the start of the bear channel. That was the September 2018 high just above 1.18. They then should expect a trading range for many months after that.<p>Will the rally get there, or is this just a bigger bull leg in the bear channel? It does not matter because traders will trade them the same. Both will continue to have reversals every few weeks. Traders will therefore look to take 100 – 200 pip profits on legs up and down.<p>The monthly chart is probably in a trading range from just below 1.09 to 1.18. Traders expect that to continue for many months and possibly more than a year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD gapped up overnight gapped above the 14 month bear trend line. On the 5 minute chart, it rallied and sold off. It is now around the open of the day.<p>Traders are deciding if the breakout above the targets will succeed or fail. The overnight reversal tells us that many bulls took profits. This profit taking increases the chance of sideways to down trading for a few days.<p>The selling over the past 3 hours has been minor. So far, today is a trading range day and it is back to the open. That increases the chance that it will remain a trading range day. Furthermore, the chart is telling us that traders are focusing on the open. They might look for scalps above and below it all day.<p>The bears want the breakout to fail and for the EURUSD to accelerate down. They would like the gap up to close and for the day to become a big bear reversal day. There is a better chance of that than of a big bull day because the EURUSD is at resistance and in a trading range on the daily chart. However, the overnight bars and legs have been small. A trading range day is more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-bull-trap-then-opening-reversal-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax and bull trap then opening reversal down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls want the year to close on its high after opening on its low. Because there is no credible top, the Emini will probably be sideways to up through December.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market has been in a tight trading range for 9 weeks and a bigger trading range for 4 months. It is in Breakout Mode. More sideways price action is likely.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>weekly Forex chart reversed down on profit-taking on Friday. The bulls achieved their goal of 2 legs up to the bear trend line after the October 1 nested wedge bottom. It might pull back a little next week, but the 5 month trading range is likely to continue.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>9 week tight trading range on weekly chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Bond-futures-double-bottom-and-double-top-after-China-trade-tariff-talks-so-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-14.png\" alt=\"Bond futures double bottom and double top after China trade tariff talks so breakout mode\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures weekly chart turned down last week with an outside down bar. This week went below that low of that bar and therefore triggered a minor sell signal.<p>However, the week reversed up on Friday and the weekly candlestick had a small bull body. This week is therefore just another bar in a 9 bar tight trading range. Because the body is small and there is a prominent tail on top, this week is a weak buy signal bar. There will probably be sellers not far above this week’s high. This is therefore probably not be the start of a major move up.<p>There is no sign on the weekly chart that the bond market is about to break out up or down. However, Friday was a big bull bar on the daily chart. There will probably be some follow-through buying next week.<h3>9 week tight trading range so Breakout Mode</h3><p>A 9 week tight trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is always both a credible buy and sell signal. Most often, there is both a small double bottom and double top. This is the case now.<p>It is important to understand that there is no breakout until there is a breakout. Continued reversals every couple of weeks are more likely than a successful breakout.<p>Since the trading range is about 7 points tall, traders expect a 7 point move either above or below the range. Traders should understand that the probability is about the same for the bulls and bears. Furthermore, the 1st breakout up or down has a 50% chance of reversing.<p>Do not forget the monthly chart. I have mentioned many times that it has been making a<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"major top over the past several years. (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#30-yr-bonds-mkt-rising-interest-rates-next-20-years\" target=\"_blank\">major top over the past several years.</a>There is no strong reversal down yet. Also, the bulls might get another minor new high. However, bonds will go down and interest rates will go up over the next 20 years. The nested wedge top on the monthly chart is clear and strong.<h3>Weak selloff usually results in trading range</h3><p>Even though the weekly chart has been drifting lower for 4 months, the selloff is weak. It lacks consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows. Furthermore, there have been several bull bars closing near their highs on the weekly chart since the August top. Also, many bars have prominent tails and overlap the prior one or two bars. Finally, there are reversals every 1 – 2 weeks.<p>When a selloff has these characteristics, it typically does not go far. This type of price action is more common when the selloff is a bear leg in what will become a trading range.<p>A trading range also has bull legs. Therefore, traders will continue to look for minor reversals every 2 – 3 weeks.<p>Since there is not sustained buying or selling, traders are taking quick profits. While the weekly chart is in an early bear trend, the trend is a fairly broad bear channel. It is also a bull flag. Traders trade it more like a trading range than a bear trend. They buy low, sell, high, and take quick profits.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Profit-taking after 2nd leg up from nested wedge bottom</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-rally-to-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-14-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex wedge rally to bear trend line\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart reversed up from a nested wedge bottom on October 1. The 3 week rally in October was the strongest rally in 2 years on the weekly chart. Consequently, the bulls were likely to get at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up. The rally over the past 3 weeks fulfilled that minimum expectation.<p>The next important target for the bulls is the October 21 high. If the bulls can get 2 closes above it, they will then try to break above the June 25 high. That is a major lower high. When a bear rally breaks above a major lower high, traders conclude that the bear trend has evolved into a trading range or a bull trend.<p>The bears know the implications. They therefore will try hard to prevent consecutive closes above resistance. This is especially true of major resistance.<h3>Profit-taking at resistance</h3><p>For more than a month, I have been saying that the rally would test the 14 month bear trend line and probably the October high. It broke above both on Friday. I also said that it would test the 1.12 Big Round Number. Friday’s high was exactly 1.12.<p>The EURUSD reversed down on the daily chart (not shown) on Friday, indicating that the bulls took profits. The bulls were not buying at the high, betting on a successful breakout. There will probably be some follow-through selling next week.<p>In addition, the bears sold, betting that the bulls would sell out of longs. Friday is now a sell signal bar on the daily chart. However, the chart is still in a 5 month trading range. If there is a selloff, it will probably last 2 – 3 weeks and test the November low.<p>Even if the bears break below the October low, the bulls will buy a reversal up. That has been a profitable strategy for 2 years and the odds are it would work again.<h3>Trading range likely for many months</h3><p>While the bulls have not done enough to create a bull trend, the weekly bear channel has never been strong. The bulls continue to buy reversals up from new lows, like they have been doing over the past year.<p>But what about the upside potential? The 2 month rally has not been especially strong. The daily chart has been in a trading range for 5 months. Traders expect a continuation of the 5 month trading range rather than a strong breakout up or down. They will continue to look for reversals ever 2 – 3 weeks.<p>This is true whether the bear channel continues or if the EURUSD is in the early stages of a bull trend. The bulls need a strong, relentless breakout before they will buy high and hold for months. That is not likely after the 1st breakout above a tight bear channel.<p>The EURUSD will probably be in a trading range for at least several more months. It is now in search of the top of the range.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Small breakout above top of 13 year bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-monthly-bull-trend-channel-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart breaking above monthly bull trend channel line\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;finally broke above the top of its 13 year bull channel on Thursday. The breakout is small so far, but there are many days left to the month.<p>I had been saying for a couple months that the breakout was likely. But I also have been saying that there is only a 25% chance of a successful breakout above the top of a bull channel. By that, I mean an acceleration up into a stronger bull trend. The most dramatic example was the monthly chart in 1995. That breakout above a bull channel led to a huge bull trend.<p>In 75% of cases, there is a reversal down back into the channel within about 5 bars. An example of a reversal from a failed bull breakout above a bull channel happened in January 2018 on the weekly chart. The Emini eventually sold off 20% and went sideways for almost 2 years.<p>Five bars on the monthly chart is almost half a year. Therefore, the Emini could continue up for several more months before reversing down.<h3>Breakouts usually overshoot before reversing</h3><p>A breakout of a trend line or channel line on the monthly chart often goes several percent beyond the line before reversing. Therefore, this rally could continue up for 100 or more points before there is a swing down.<p>A swing down does not mean a bear trend. More often, the reversal down from above a bull channel is the start of a trading range. A common target is the middle of the channel.<p>The monthly chart had been in a trading range for 2 years. There was a smaller range within that range for 7 months in 2019. The bottom of that smaller range is the June low around 2800. If there is a reversal down within the next 6 months, that would be another reasonable support level.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>This week triggered High 1 bull flag buy signal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-weekly-bull-trend-channel-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-14-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart breaking above weekly bull trend channel line\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart finally pulled back 2 weeks ago after 9 weeks without a pullback. I said that a 9 bar bull micro channel means that the bulls are very happy to buy for any reason.<p>That is why I have been saying for more than a month that the 1st pullback would only last 1 – 2 weeks and only fall 50 – 100 points. I said that the bulls would be eager to finally be able to buy below the low of the prior week. And the did. The Emini reversed up strongly from an 85 point selloff 2 weeks ago.<p>Since last week was a pullback in a strong bull trend, it was a High 1 buy signal bar. I said last week that this past week would probably go above last week’s high and trigger the buy signal. Furthermore, I said that the all-time high from 2 weeks ago was only a few points higher. That made it likely that a breakout above last week’s high would also break to a new all-time high. That is what happened on Thursday.<h3>Higher time frame buy signal usually has a pullback</h3><p>In the chat room on Thursday, I talked how the rally was very strong and it broke far above the prior week’s high. But I also said that when a higher time frame buy signal triggers, there is usually a pullback to below the top of the buy signal bar. Despite Thursday rallying about 25 points above the prior week’s high, the Emini then sold off briefly to below that high.<p>There was one other point that I made above last week. I said that when a buy signal bar has a small body and a big tail, the setup is weak. That often results in a weak entry bar. A weak entry bar either has a big tail on top or it has a bear body.<p>This week had a prominent tail on top, which was likely. However, the weekly chart is still in a strong bull trend. Therefore the odds still favor higher prices, even if the Emini goes sideways or pulls back for a week or two first.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Small bull follow-through after Thursday’s big breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-bull-follow-through-after-new-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-14-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart bull follow-through after new all time high\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a big rally to above the top of a 13 year bull channel on Thursday. Friday had a bull body and it therefore confirmed the breakout. It increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices through December. However, Thursday was climactic and there might be a few days of sideways to down trading first.<p>The monthly chart is at the top of its bull channel, which is resistance. But, the next significant resistance on the daily chart is a measured move target based on the August 5/October 3 double bottom. The measured move projection is 3216.<p>If the Emini reverses down before reaching that target, traders would say that it formed an expanding triangle top. November 19 and November 27 are the other two highs in the pattern. Since the space between the 2nd 2 highs is much greater than that between the 1st 2, traders will conclude that the pattern is not reliable.<h3>Probably any reversal down will be minor</h3><p>What will happen if the Emini reverses down on the daily chart within the next month? The 1st targets are always the bull trend line, the EMA, and the most recent higher low, which came on December 3. When there is a reversal down from an expanding triangle top, the 1st target is the bottom of the triangle, which is that December 3 low.<p>Below that, support is the breakout point. That is the neck line of the double bottom, which is the September 19 high of 3027.25.<p>When a bull trend is as strong as the 2019 trend has been, traders expect reversals to be minor. That means that a trading range is more likely than a bear trend. Therefore, traders should expect sideways to up prices over the next month or more. Any reversal down will probably be minor.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It has been sideways since. Friday was a doji bar on the daily chart and therefore it is a low probability sell signal bar for today. The bears want Thursday’s breakout to fail. A reversal down would be from an expanding triangle top over the past month. However, any reversal down will probably be minor because the bull trend on the weekly chart is so strong.<p>The bulls see Friday as a pause after a climactic 2 week rally. They have had a great year. The year opened on its low and the bull trend has been very strong. They will try to get the year to close on its high. That will limit the downside for the rest of the month.<p>I have been saying for months that the Emini will work higher. That is still true, but Thursday was climactic. Therefore, there might be a pullback for a day or two this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 14 points in the Globex session. It might gap up on the daily and weekly charts to a new high. Traders see the 3200 Big Round Number as a magnet above. The Emini will probably get there this week and maybe today. This is especially true with the strong bull trend on the weekly chart and the desire of the bulls to have the year close on its high.<p>A small gap up usually closes early in the day. However, with the strong momentum up on the daily and weekly charts, the odds would favor a pullback instead of a reversal. Unless the bears get several bear bars closing near their lows on the open, traders will look to buy any early selloff.<p>The Emini is in a buy climax and at resistance on the daily chart. That increases the chance of a trend day up or down. But most of the days over the past few weeks spent a lot of time going sideways, even though the Emini has been going up. Unless there is a strong breakout up or down early today, traders will again expect a lot of trading range price action.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-bull-trap-then-opening-reversal-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-16.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax and bull trap then opening reversal down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-pullback-from-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex pullback from bear trend line\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a big bear reversal day on Friday. It is a sell signal bar for today for a failed breakout above the October high and the bear trend line.<p>However, it is in a 5 month trading range and the 3 week bull channel is tight. That lowers the probability of a reversal down. Furthermore, the bar on Friday was big. A big bar means big risk.<p>When there are things wrong with a sell setup, the reversal is usually only minor. Consequently, if there is a selloff this week, it will probably find support around the December 6 low.<p>Because the 3 week bull channel is tight, sideways to up is likely. In addition, the August 6 high is the top of the 5 month range and that is a magnet above. Therefore, traders should expect a test of that high within a few weeks even if there is a 1 – 2 week pullback first.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market did not fall below Friday’s low. It therefore did not yet trigger the sell signal on the daily chart. That lack of urgency is evidence that the sell setup is not strong.<p>The overnight session opened near its low and rallied. But the range has only been 25 pips. It therefore did not erase much of Friday’s selling. The bulls want today to close near its high. It would then be a buy signal bar on the daily chart for tomorrow.<p>However, Friday’s selloff was strong enough so that traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down this week. That will limit today’s rally. The lack of triggering a sell signal makes a big bear day unlikely. Today will therefore probably remain a small, scalping day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-gap-up-and-weak-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini gap up and weak bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It stalled there for most of the day. There was a minor reversal down from a wedge top in the middle of the day. Today closed just below 3200.<p>The odds continue to favor higher prices, even if there is a 1 – 3 day pullback. Additionally, despite the 3 week rally, most days have had mostly trading range price action. Day traders will expect that to continue until there is a clear, strong breakout up or down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Unless there is a strong breakout up or down early today, traders will again expect a lot of trading range price action.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-and-bull-trap-then-opening-reversal-down.png\"><img src=\"2019-12-16.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge buy climax and bull trap then opening reversal down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It is a sell signal bar for today for a failed breakout above the October high and the bear trend line.<p>However, it is in a 5 month trading range and the 3 week bull channel is tight. That lowers the probability of a reversal down. Furthermore, the bar on Friday was big. A big bar means big risk.<p>When there are things wrong with a sell setup, the reversal is usually only minor. Consequently, if there is a selloff this week, it will probably find support around the December 6 low.<p>Because the 3 week bull channel is tight, sideways to up is likely. In addition, the August 6 high is the top of the 5 month range and that is a magnet above. Therefore, traders should expect a test of that high within a few weeks even if there is a 1 – 2 week pullback first.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market did not fall below Friday’s low. It therefore did not yet trigger the sell signal on the daily chart. That lack of urgency is evidence that the sell setup is not strong.<p>The overnight session opened near its low and rallied. But the range has only been 25 pips. It therefore did not erase much of Friday’s selling. The bulls want today to close near its high. It would then be a buy signal bar on the daily chart for tomorrow.<p>However, Friday’s selloff was strong enough so that traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down this week. That will limit today’s rally. The lack of triggering a sell signal makes a big bear day unlikely. Today will therefore probably remain a small, scalping day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-gap-up-and-weak-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini gap up and weak bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today closed just below 3200.<p>The odds continue to favor higher prices, even if there is a 1 – 3 day pullback.

The bulls are trying to get the year to close on the high after opening near the low in January.<p>While the Emini rallied early yesterday in a Small Pullback Bull Trend, the bars were small. Also, much of the time was within tight trading ranges. It spent a lot of time around the 3200 Big Round Number, and closed just below. That might therefore be a magnet again today.<p>Although the odds continue to favor higher prices, most of the days over the past 3 weeks have had a lot of trading range price action. Traders will therefore continue to expect it. It is a self-perpetuating behavior. The more trading range price action, the more traders buy low, sell high, and scalp. That results in a continuation of the behavior.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 1 point in the Globex session. It will therefore open around the 3200 Big Round Number, which was the dominant price yesterday.<p>Since the rally over the past 3 weeks is extreme, traders expect that the bulls will take some profits soon. That would result in at least a 1 – 2 day pullback. Traders are deciding if the pullback will begin at 3200 or from slightly higher.<p>With the bulls trying to win the year and get it to close on the high, traders expect higher prices over the remaining 2 weeks of 2019. However, most of the days over the past 3 weeks have had a lot of trading range price action. Day traders will expect more again today.<p>Everyone knows that a strong break above 3200 or a strong reversal down can come at any time. But until there is a strong breakout, day traders will continue to look for small profits and reversals.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-gap-up-and-weak-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-17.png\" alt=\"Emini gap up and weak bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Friday was a surprisingly big bear bar closing near its low. A Bear Surprise Bar typically has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>Yesterday was a bull inside day in a 4 week rally. It was therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. By the EURUSD today going above yesterday’s high, it triggered the buy signal. But yesterday was a doji inside bar. That is a lower probability buy setup. Friday’s Bear Surprise Bar further lowers the probability of an immediate resumption of the bull trend.<p>The 4 week rally is strong enough to continue up to the August high and possibly the June high. But the EURUSD will probably have to go sideways to down for a few days before it will strongly break above Friday’s high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied 45 pips overnight. By going above yesterday’s high, it triggered a buy signal on the daily chart. But remember, the buy setup on the daily chart is not strong. That reduces the chance of a big bull day today.<p>Since the 6 hour rally was in a tight bull channel, the odds are against a bear trend today. However, the reversal down from a small buy climax over the past hour means that the bulls have begun to take profits. They now will switch to buying pullbacks instead of at the market. In addition, they will be less willing to hold onto longs for swing trades. They will be scalping more.<p>The small reversal down is probably the start of a trading range. If so, the bears will finally begin to sell reversals down for scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-triangle-with-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle with late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, yesterday was also another small trading range day that traded around the 3200 Big Round Number.<p>Is the Emini stalling here because of the impeachment? Traders don’t think that way, and it is better to ignore the news. Just trade based on the price action, which is the result of the cumulative votes of anyone in the market who matters.<p>Because the Emini is stalling at resistance, it might pull back for a day or two. But since the bulls want the year to close on its high and the bull trend is strong, the odds still favor sideways to up through December.<p>If today gaps down, the bears will have a 2 day island top. An island top is a minor reversal, but traders know that it could lead to a 2 – 3 day pullback. If there is a gap down, the bulls will try to close it early today. If there is an early rally after a gap down, the bears will look for it to fail and form an early high of the day.<p>It is important to see that the Emini is stalling at the resistance of the 3200 Big Round Number. That slightly increases the chance of a big trend day up or down. But with the unusually tight trading ranges of the past 2 days, day traders know that the odds favor more trading range price action again today. If there is a trend, down is more likely because of the buy climax over the past 3 weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 3 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably again be around the 3200 magnet on the open. It could stay there all day, like it has done for 2 days.<p>The bears want either a gap down or a strong selloff below yesterday’s low. If they get either, they could get a bear trend day today.<p>The 2 day trading range is a bull flag. The bulls therefore want a breakout above and then a bull trend.<p>After 2 days of tight trading range price action, day traders know that the odds favor more sideways trading again today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-triangle-with-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-18.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle with late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is now a micro double top. Friday is also now a double top with the October high.<p>Since the weekly chart is still in a bear trend, the bears want a reversal down to a new 2 year low. However, there is also a 3 month trading range within a 5 month trading range.<p>Trading ranges resist successful breakouts. Consequently, the best the bears can probably get is a brief dip below the October low. More likely, if today is the start of a selloff, it will probably only last 2 – 3 weeks, like every other leg up and down for the past 2 years.<p>The bulls want today’s selloff to be brief. They would like a reversal back up this week. Then, the selloff will be just a High 2 bull flag in the 3 week rally. If the EURUSD does not reverse up this week, the bulls will try to get a reversal up from a double bottom with either the December 6 or November 29 lows.<p>It is important to remember that the EURUSD daily chart is in a trading range. Traders will expect reversals instead of breakouts. There will eventually be a successful breakout, but most attempts fail. As a result, traders will continue to expect reversals every few weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off 45 pips overnight. However, the selloff came in 2 legs. The current second leg has a series of sell climaxes and the bars are small. While there is no bottom yet, this type of selloff typically evolves into a trading range. Although day traders have only been selling, once the selloff stalls and the chart begins to go sideways, they will also buy.<p>The selloff has been in a tight bear channel. Also, there is a micro double top at resistance on the daily chart. That makes a bull trend reversal unlikely.

However, yesterday was also another small trading range day that traded around the 3200 Big Round Number.<p>Is the Emini stalling here because of the impeachment? Traders don’t think that way, and it is better to ignore the news. Just trade based on the price action, which is the result of the cumulative votes of anyone in the market who matters.<p>Because the Emini is stalling at resistance, it might pull back for a day or two. But since the bulls want the year to close on its high and the bull trend is strong, the odds still favor sideways to up through December.<p>If today gaps down, the bears will have a 2 day island top. An island top is a minor reversal, but traders know that it could lead to a 2 – 3 day pullback. If there is a gap down, the bulls will try to close it early today. If there is an early rally after a gap down, the bears will look for it to fail and form an early high of the day.<p>It is important to see that the Emini is stalling at the resistance of the 3200 Big Round Number. That slightly increases the chance of a big trend day up or down. But with the unusually tight trading ranges of the past 2 days, day traders know that the odds favor more trading range price action again today. If there is a trend, down is more likely because of the buy climax over the past 3 weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 3 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably again be around the 3200 magnet on the open. It could stay there all day, like it has done for 2 days.<p>The bears want either a gap down or a strong selloff below yesterday’s low. If they get either, they could get a bear trend day today.<p>The 2 day trading range is a bull flag. The bulls therefore want a breakout above and then a bull trend.<p>After 2 days of tight trading range price action, day traders know that the odds favor more sideways trading again today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-triangle-with-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img src=\"2019-12-18.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle with late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-micro-double-top-at-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-18-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex micro double top at bear trend line\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market turned down overnight after yesterday’s 2nd test of the bear trend line. There is now a micro double top. Friday is also now a double top with the October high.<p>Since the weekly chart is still in a bear trend, the bears want a reversal down to a new 2 year low. However, there is also a 3 month trading range within a 5 month trading range.<p>Trading ranges resist successful breakouts. Consequently, the best the bears can probably get is a brief dip below the October low. More likely, if today is the start of a selloff, it will probably only last 2 – 3 weeks, like every other leg up and down for the past 2 years.<p>The bulls want today’s selloff to be brief. They would like a reversal back up this week. Then, the selloff will be just a High 2 bull flag in the 3 week rally. If the EURUSD does not reverse up this week, the bulls will try to get a reversal up from a double bottom with either the December 6 or November 29 lows.<p>It is important to remember that the EURUSD daily chart is in a trading range. Traders will expect reversals instead of breakouts. There will eventually be a successful breakout, but most attempts fail. As a result, traders will continue to expect reversals every few weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off 45 pips overnight. However, the selloff came in 2 legs. The current second leg has a series of sell climaxes and the bars are small. While there is no bottom yet, this type of selloff typically evolves into a trading range. Although day traders have only been selling, once the selloff stalls and the chart begins to go sideways, they will also buy.<p>The selloff has been in a tight bear channel. Also, there is a micro double top at resistance on the daily chart. That makes a bull trend reversal unlikely. But day traders will probably soon switch from swing trading shorts to scalping longs and shorts.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-trading-range-around-3200-Big-Round-Number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range around 3200 Big Round Number\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Yesterday was a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That is a type of buy climax. That increases the chance of some trading range price action today. But, with the bulls trying to get the year to close on the high, there is not much downside risk through the end of December. Also, there is no sign of a top. Traders expect more sideways to up trading.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 1 point in the Globex session. Since yesterday was a strong bull trend, the bulls will begin to take some profits at some point today. That increases the chance of more sideways trading today.<p>However, the bull trend has been strong for 3 months. The bulls have been in control and they would like to continue that control through yearend. Therefore, the odds are that any surprise will be up rather than down.<p>There is always a chance of a panic profit-taking from a crowded trade. If everyone believes that the Emini will go up, but it stalls, some bulls might take some profits before the end of the year. If enough do, it could trigger panic selling. This could lead to 2 – 3 bear trend days. However, it is more likely that the Emini will continue sideways to up for the remaining 8 trading days of the decade.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-Small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-20.png\" alt=\"Emini Small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-at-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-20-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top at bear trend line\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market turned down from a double top at the bear trend line last week. While there have not been consecutive big bear bars, the selling has been strong enough to make lower prices likely.<p>The targets are the prior lows. The bulls want a double bottom with either the December 6 or November 29 low. But even if the selloff continues down to a new 2 year low below the October low, the bulls will buy a reversal up. That has been a profitable strategy for 2 years.<p>So we know bulls will buy the selloff, but we don’t know when or where. Where will the bears sell? They have been selling above prior highs. That is trading range price action. Traders look for reversals at prior highs and lows.<p>This has been going on for the 15 months of the bear channel. The channel has been so flat that traders have been trading it like a trading range that it sloped slightly downward. They will continue to look for reversals every 2 – 3 weeks until there is a clear, strong breakout into a trend.<p>Since most bear channels eventually have a bull breakout, if there is a transition into a strong trend, it will probably be up. However, a bear channel is more likely to have a weak bull breakout and evolve into a trading range.<p>That is what traders should expect over the next year. While the price action will be similar to what it has been, the pattern will be a trading range instead of a weak bear channel. Traders will continue to look for reversals every 2 – 3 weeks for all of 2020.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight. Even though the selloff was only 35 pips, it is enough to make traders believe that the 6 day selloff on the daily chart will continue down to some higher low. The 1st target is the December 6 higher low at 1.1040.<p>The bears want a continuation of the overnight selloff and a big bear trend day. But look at the selling over the past 6 days. It has not been relentless. Consequently, today will probably not fall much further.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways for 2 hours. That means that the bulls will begin to buy reversals up for scalps. It also means that the bears are switching to selling rallies. Instead of selling breakouts to a new low, they now are taking profits at the low.<p>The 5 minute chart is still in a bear trend and it might continue down all day. But the small bars and the 2 hour trading range make a transition into a trading range more likely.<p>Can the bulls get a reversal up? The small bars indicate a lack of energy. Traders think that the price is just about right. That reduces the chance of a big move up or down for the rest of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-trending-trading-range-day-with-Low-4-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day with Low 4 top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It had a brief bull breakout and entered another trading range. This was therefore a Trending Trading Range day. The bulls were unable to get sustained trend resumption up at the end of the day.<p>Next week is Christmas week. It is usually the quietest week of the year. There are usually more tight trading ranges than usual. Furthermore, they tend to be tighter and last longer that at other times. While there will be some swings, day traders should expect mostly trading range price action.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls want the month, the year, and the decade to close on the high. The Emini will probably be sideways to up through yearend.<p>The<strong>bond</strong>market is in an early bear trend on the monthly chart, but it is at support. The nested wedge bottom on the daily chart could lead to a bounce for a week or two.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has been sideways for 5 months. There is no sign that the trading range is about to end. Since it is stalling at the bear trend line and the October high, it will probably be sideways to down for a week or two.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Nested wedge bottom so bounce soon</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Bond-futures-with-double-top-and-double-bottom-or-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-21.png\" alt=\"Bond futures with double top and double bottom or wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures is having a 3rd push down since the August top on the weekly chart. The bulls want either a double bottom with the November 7 low or a failed breakout below that low. A reversal up from below would be a wedge bull flag where September 13 was the 1st leg down.<p>If the bulls get a reversal up, it will probably be minor. The monthly chart (not shown) has been creating a major top over the past several years. Even if the bulls get a new all-time high, it will probably be brief. Traders should expect the bonds to work lower over the next decade.<p>That means interest rates will start to go up. I have said many times that<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"the American public will not allow zero interest rates. (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\">the American public will not allow zero interest rates.</a>They would see that as an unacceptable failure.<p>Americans are proud and see themselves as the world leaders in capitalism. If their country cannot afford to pay interest on the money it borrows, and in fact charges money to people lending it money (people who buy bonds), that would be offensive. It therefore will not happen. That is a fundamental reason why the bonds will not rally much from here. The technical picture of a nested wedge on the monthly chart is a strong reason as well.<h3>Where do bonds go from here?</h3><p>The monthly chart is creating its 4th consecutive bar bar. This is coming after a parabolic wedge top and a failed breakout above a nested wedge top. Bonds will go lower on the monthly chart.<p>When there is a reversal down from a buy climax, the first targets are the 20 month EMA and the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the August low on the monthly chart. Traders should therefore look for lower prices over the next several months. This is true even if there is a bounce early in 2020.<p>After 3 or 4 bear bars down from a buy climax, traders expect at least a small 2nd leg down. Consequently, any rally over the next several months should be minor. It could last 1 – 3 bars. Since this is a monthly chart, that means a few months. But it will form a lower high and lead to at least a small 2nd leg down.<p>It is important to note that a 2nd leg down means that the 1st leg down will end at some point. There will soon be a bounce. Furthermore, 5 or 6 consecutive bear bars would be unusual. Traders should expect a bull bar in January or February.<h3>Wedge bottom on daily and weekly charts</h3><p>The December selloff on the daily chart (not shown) has 3 legs down. Thursday and Friday formed small bull reversal bars. Traders see this as a wedge bottom and a double bottom with the November low. They therefore expect a couple legs up within a few weeks. It might begin next week.<p>The wedge selloff on the daily chart is the 3rd leg down in a possible wedge bottom on the weekly chart. Therefore, the daily wedge is nested within a bigger weekly wedge. A nested wedge bottom has a higher probability of leading to a rally with at least a couple legs up.<p>The bulls might even get a rally to the 166 top of the 2 month trading range over the next couple months. However, the odds still favor any rally to form a lower high. Traders should assume that the bond market will work lower for many years. There will be many strong rallies, but each will be followed by a new low in the developing bear trend on the monthly chart.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Trading range might continue for all of 2020</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-bear-flag-at-bear-trend-line-but-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-21-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex wedge bear flag at bear trend line but in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart in October had the strongest rally in its 2 year bear trend. Traders expected a 2nd leg up to resistance. Last week satisfied that minimum objective. The rally broke above the October high and the 15 month bear trend line.<p>However, this week formed a bear bar that closed near its low. It is therefore a Low 2 sell signal bar for next week. The Low 1 (end of the 1st leg up) ended on October 21. This increases the chance of a test of the November 29 low next week.<h3>Has the 2 year bear trend ended?</h3><p>Traders are deciding if the 2 year bear trend has ended. The 3 month rally is good for the bulls, but not good enough to convince traders that a bull trend is underway.<p>The chart has been sideways for 5 months. It is therefore in a trading range. Every trading range always has both reasonable buy and sell setups. But neither is high probability.<p>Markets have inertia. They resist change. Traders should expect breakout attempts to fail and for the trading range to continue. Eventually there will be a successful breakout up or down. But the current rally has not yet been strong enough to make traders believe that the bulls will finally get their breakout.<p>The bears have sold every rally for 2 years. They sold this one as well. Each selloff eventually resulted in a new low. But the bears quickly took profits and the bulls confidently bought every new low. That will probably happen again if the bears break below the October low.<p>The lack of momentum up and down and the reversals every 2 – 3 weeks make a continuation of the trading range most likely. There is no evidence that a a strong trend up or down is about to begin.<p>Just as the bulls were disappointed by this week, the bears will probably be disappointed with the next couple weeks. Traders should not expect this week’s sell signal to quickly lead to a new 2 year low. There should be at least a 2 – 3 week pause around the November 29 low. The bulls would then try to get a reversal up from a double bottom.<p>Nothing has changed. This is trading range price action. Traders should expect reversals and disappointing follow-through after buy and sell signals.<h3>What about next year?</h3><p>The EURUSD has been in a tight bear channel on the monthly chart for 2 years. The first breakout above is typically minor. That means, once it comes, it probably will not last more than a few months.<p>Also, the 2 year bear trend is a Spike and Channel trend. Traders expect an eventual rally to the beginning of the channel. That is the September 2018 high around 1.18.<p>They then expect a trading range. Since a trading range is at least 10 – 20 bars and I am talking about the monthly chart, the EURUSD market will probably be sideways for the next year. The bottom will be around the October 2019 low of 1.0879 or slightly lower, like down to 1.08. And, the top might reach around 1.18.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>End of strong year and decade</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-strong-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly candlestick chart in strong bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;is forming its 4th consecutive bull bar in December. It is in a strong bull trend.<p>The year opened on its low and it is now near its high. The bulls want the year to close near its high. That would give traders confidence going into next month. It would increase the chance of higher prices over the next few months.<p>After 4 bull bars, the 1st reversal down will probably be minor. That means the best the bears can probably get over next few months is a 1 – 2 bar (month) pullback.<h3>End of a very strong decade</h3><p>Not only is the Emini at the end of a strong month and year, it is also at the end of a strong decade. Look back over the past 10 years. The decade opened in 2010 near its low and it is now closing near its high. That is a sign of strong bulls. It increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices over the next year or two.<p>I am not showing a yearly chart (where each bar is 1 year). However, the decade had several big bars followed by smaller bars. That means that the 10 year rally is in a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>A climax eventually attracts profit-takers. Once it does, the chart typically enters a trading range, often for 10 or more bars (years, since I am talking about a yearly chart). That is why I have been saying that the Emini will probably enter a trading range within a few years that could last for a decade. This is what happened in the 1970’s and after 2000.<p>While there is no top yet, the 5 – 10 year trading range will probably begin within 3 years. As hard as it might be to believe after an 11 year bull trend, traders should expect at least one 40 – 60% correction in the next decade.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Parabolic wedge rally, but no top yet</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-weekly-candlestick-chart-measured-move-targets.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-21-3.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly candlestick chart measured move targets\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart gapped up this week and rallied. It has been in a particularly strong bull trend for 3 months and there is no top.<p>Every strong trend eventually attracts profit-takers. When the bull channel is tight, like this one, the initial profit-taking is usually brief. There might be a 1 – 3 week pullback at any time. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get a bigger pullback.<p>There was a big doji bar 2 weeks ago. That is often the 1st sign that the bulls are starting to take profits. When the bull trend resumes, as it did last week, the resumption often stalls within a few weeks from additional profit-taking. But the downside risk is small for at least a few weeks.<h3>Measured Move Targets based on the height of trading ranges</h3><p>There are several ways to calculate measured move targets. No one knows in advance how many institutions will take profits at any of the targets. Traders will evaluate the strength of any rally to a target and then watch how the markets acts when it is near the target. Will it stall and enter a trading range? Will it reverse strongly? Will it break strongly above and quickly race up to the next target?<p>The simplest measured move projection is based on the height of the trading range. However, there are usually several possible highs and lows that one can use. Also, there are frequently smaller ranges within a trading range, and they also can lead to reliable targets. Sometimes there are obvious points that everyone will use. That is not the case here.<p>There was a double top in January and September 2018. After a failed breakout below in December 2018, the Emini broke above. A measured up from the February 2018 neckline to the double top is 3367.00<p>There was another double top using that September 2018 high and the May 2019 high. The measured move up from the December 2018 neckline to the September 2018 high (which was about the same as the May 2019 high) is 3575.50<h3>Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move targets</h3><p>There are 2 ways to draw a Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move where Leg 1 is the rally from the December 2018 low (point 1, which is the start of Leg 1) to the May 2019 high (point 2, which is the end of Leg 1). Some traders will say that the Leg 2 up began in June 2019. Their projection is 3352.25 (the end of Leg 2).<p>But the Emini went sideways for many months and the bull trend did not clearly resume up until October 2019. I prefer using that low as the start of the 2nd leg up. That measured move target is 3474.75.<p>These 4 targets are between about 3350 and 3575. It is reasonable to assume that the Emini will be about 10% above this December’s close at some point in 2019. If so, it could reach all of the targets. Additional targets will become obvious as pullbacks come over the next many months.<p>Traders should try to find as many reasonable targets (also called magnets or resistance) as they can because targets often lead to profit-taking. Because they are magnets, the bulls will buy pullbacks, expecting the Emini to get drawn to that resistance. Once at a magnet, there is often a reasonable short trade.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Possible Final Bull Flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-daily-candlestick-chart-in-strong-rally-but-parabolic-wedge.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-21-4.png\" alt=\"Emini daily candlestick chart in strong rally but parabolic wedge\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart gapped up on Monday, but then went sideways for 3 days. The bulls got a breakout on Thursday. There are now 3 legs up in the tight bull channel from the December 3 low.<p>The rally is therefore a parabolic wedge buy climax. Will the bulls take profits and will the bears get a reversal down from here?<p>When the channel is tight like this, the 1st reversal down is typically minor. Furthermore, the bulls want the Emini to close near the high of the month, the year, and the decade as a sign of strength. They have been in control on all of those time frames and are unlikely to give up with so little time left. That reduces the downside risk through yearend.<h3>Measured move target above</h3><p>There was a double top with the November 27 and December 6 highs. When a rally breaks above a double top, it often continues up for a measured move. The neckline was the December 3 low. A measured move up from the December 3 low to the December 6 high is 3235. That is a reasonable near-term target for the current rally.<p>If the rally gets there, there will probably be some profit-taking. If it goes above, traders might instead be using the July 26 high for the measured move projection. The target from there is 3243. There are other targets on the weekly chart (see above).<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

On the yearly chart (not shown) where each bar is one year, you would see that the decade opened near the low and it is now closing near its high. Also, this year would be a big bull bar. This 11 year rally is an unusual event and you will probably never see something as strong as this again on the yearly chart in your trading career.<p>The bulls are trying to show that they are still strong. They want the year and the decade to close near their highs. Since they have been in control for 10 years (actually, 11), they will probably achieve their goal. The Emini will probably be sideways to up through December.<p>There is always a chance of profit-taking. The Emini often tries to either duplicate or do the opposite of what it most recently did on any time frame. There was a crash last Christmas that reversed up sharply. This year, the Emini is crashing up. There is therefore a small, but real, chance of a big selloff soon after Christmas, which would be the opposite of last year. But the downside risk is currently small. Traders will buy the next 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>Christmas week is traditionally the quietest week of the year. There are usually more and longer tight trading ranges on the 5 minute chart than at other times. Furthermore, the ranges can be very tight. While there will be some swings, most of the week will probably be quiet.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points on the Globex chart. It might gap up today. If so, it would form another gap up on the weekly chart, like it did last week.<p>The bull trend on the daily and weekly charts has been strong. Most days over the past few weeks closed above the open. However, most had a lot of trading range price action. Consequently, day traders expect a bullish bias, but mostly quiet trading.<p>Since the trend is strong on the daily chart and today will probably gap up, there is a slightly increased chance of a big trend day. If there is a trend, up is more likely. However, Christmas week is typically the quietest of the year. If the early bars are small and if there is a trading range open, a trading range will be likely today.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-trending-trading-range-day-with-Low-4-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-23.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day with Low 4 top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-and-possible-double-bottom-in-5-month-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-23-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top and possible double bottom in 5 month trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market turned down from a double top at the bar trend line 2 weeks ago. Last week is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart (not shown). However, this week is still above last week’s low and therefore the sell signal did not yet trigger.<p>Friday was the 3rd big bear day in the past 6 days on the daily chart. The prior 2 instances had bad follow-through. So far, today is bad follow-through again for the bears.<p>This type of price action more often happens in trading ranges than in bear trends. Traders therefore at the moment do no believe the selloff is particularly bearish. It looks like all of the other selloffs over the past 2 years. Traders expect it to last for a few weeks and then reverse back up.<p>The bulls want a double bottom. The 3 possibilities for the 1st leg of the double bottom are the December 6 low, the November 29 low, and the October 1 bottom of the 2 year bear channel.<p>They do not know where there reversal up will begin, but they are confident that it will come. The bulls want to see a good bull trend reversal bar near one of those 3 lows. If they get it, especially if there is also a micro double bottom, they will look for a 2 – 3 week rally.<p>At some point, there will be a successful break of the 2 year bear channel. A bull breakout is always more likely. But a bear channel typically converts into a big trading range instead of into a strong bull trend. Consequently, traders should expect a trading range over the next year. The top of the range might be at the September 2018 start of the bear channel, which was around 1.18.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 20 pip range over night. Christmas week often has a lot of small, sideways days.<p>However, last week is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. Today’s low is currently only 3 pips above last week’s low. Day traders should expect today or tomorrow to fall below last week’s low and trigger the sell signal. But because the daily chart is in the middle of a 5 month trading range, they also expect that there probably will be buyers not far below the sell signal bar.<p>Today is unlikely to have a big trend bar up or down. Day traders are looking for small scalps on reversals up or down. If there is a strong breakout in either direction, they will swing trade. However, they know that it probably not come this week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-small-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini gapped up to another all-time high, but it immediately pulled back and entered a small trading range. This is typical Christmas week trading. There were few reasonable stop entry setups. The range was small enough to make it difficult for even the limit orders traders to make much money. Today had the smallest range in 2 years.<p>Most days this week and next will probably be similar, even though there is a bullish bias. However, there is usually at least one trend day during the Christmas/New Year’s break. Because both are on Wednesday, the slow trading will probably be for a full 2 weeks this season. There is an early close tomorrow and it will probably be very quiet. I therefore will not trade tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This year Christmas is on a Wednesday. Traders expect next week will be quiet as well. The Emini usually spends a lot of in tight trading ranges. They often are too tight to trade. Day traders find themselves patiently waiting the few brief opportunities each day to make money with stop order entries.<p>I have said several times that the Emini often either repeats some recent behavior or it does the opposite. Since last year crashed in December and violently reversed up, there is an increased chance that the current December crash up might reverse down violently, at least for a few days within the next few weeks.<p>This is particularly true since the December rally has had 3 legs up in a tight channel. There is therefore a parabolic wedge buy climax, which increases the chance of a week or two of profit-taking.<p>Also, after a strong year, there often is some tax-related selling in January. However, the bull trend is strong enough to make higher prices likely, even if there are a few surprisingly big bear days in the next few weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini has been in a tight trading range overnight and for the past 2 days. Day traders will look for scalps unless there is a strong breakout up or down. Normally, when there is a Surprise Breakout in a strong bull trend, up is more likely. But because of the parabolic wedge buy climax, if there is going to be a surprise this week or next, down is probably slightly more likely.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-tght-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-26.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex tight trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a tight trading range for 4 days. It is also in the middle of a 3 month range and a 5 month range. It is therefore in Breakout Mode. This week and next week will probably remain quiet because of the holidays.<p>The odds are that there will be an eventual end of the 2 year bear trend and then the start of a big trading range from around 1.08 to 1.18 over the next year. Traders are deciding if the low is in or whether there will be another brief low or two before the swing up begins.<p>Forex markets often have major transitions around the start of a year. Consequently, there is an increased chance that the EURUSD will begin a yearlong weak rally soon.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market have been in an unusually tight trading range for 4 days. Day traders are scalping.

This year Christmas is on a Wednesday. Traders expect next week will be quiet as well. The Emini usually spends a lot of in tight trading ranges. They often are too tight to trade. Day traders find themselves patiently waiting the few brief opportunities each day to make money with stop order entries.<p>I have said several times that the Emini often either repeats some recent behavior or it does the opposite. Since last year crashed in December and violently reversed up, there is an increased chance that the current December crash up might reverse down violently, at least for a few days within the next few weeks.<p>This is particularly true since the December rally has had 3 legs up in a tight channel. There is therefore a parabolic wedge buy climax, which increases the chance of a week or two of profit-taking.<p>Also, after a strong year, there often is some tax-related selling in January. However, the bull trend is strong enough to make higher prices likely, even if there are a few surprisingly big bear days in the next few weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini has been in a tight trading range overnight and for the past 2 days. Day traders will look for scalps unless there is a strong breakout up or down. Normally, when there is a Surprise Breakout in a strong bull trend, up is more likely. But because of the parabolic wedge buy climax, if there is going to be a surprise this week or next, down is probably slightly more likely.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-tght-trading-range.png\"><img src=\"2019-12-26.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex tight trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a tight trading range for 4 days. It is also in the middle of a 3 month range and a 5 month range. It is therefore in Breakout Mode. This week and next week will probably remain quiet because of the holidays.<p>The odds are that there will be an eventual end of the 2 year bear trend and then the start of a big trading range from around 1.08 to 1.18 over the next year. Traders are deciding if the low is in or whether there will be another brief low or two before the swing up begins.<p>Forex markets often have major transitions around the start of a year. Consequently, there is an increased chance that the EURUSD will begin a yearlong weak rally soon.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market have been in an unusually tight trading range for 4 days. Day traders are scalping. But when the range is this tight, there are few opportunities to make much money.<p>Because big moves often come at the start of a new year, day traders are ready for a surprisingly big move up or down.

But yesterday’s late bull breakout changed the price action. It increased the chances of a stronger bull trend today and possible through the end of the decade on Tuesday.<p>Gaps on the monthly chart are unusual. The Emini had a gap up in October. With the bull trend as strong as it is, traders need to wonder if next year will gap up. That would be a gap on the yearly chart, which would be even more unusual.<p>I suspect that there has never been an open gap on the yearly chart. Consequently, even if next Thursday were to gap up to a new high, the gap would probably close within a few months. However, it would be another sign of just how strong the ongoing buy climax has been.<p>The bull trends on the daily and weekly charts are strong. The bulls are trying to have the year and decade close on their highs at a new all-time high. Therefore, there is an upward bias for the remaining 3 days of the decade.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex market. It will therefore probably gap up. Yesterday’s strong close increase the chance of a bull trend today. The bulls are trying to finish the strongly bullish decade as strongly as they can. The odds continue to favor sideways to up through yearend next Tuesday.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-gap-up-trading-range-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-27.png\" alt=\"Emini gap up trading range then bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is reversing up from a higher low test of the December 6 low. The bulls want a break above the December 13 top of the 6 month trading range. If they get 2 closes above that high, the rally will probably continue up to the June high above 1.14. In addition, it would increase the chance of the rally completely reversing the 16 month bear channel that began in September 2018.<p>The bears know that markets resist change. They therefore expect the trading range to continue. They will try to get a reversal down from the December high.<p>But even though markets resist change, 16 months in a bear channel is unusual. Traders expect a bull breakout soon. The price action over the past 3 months is the most bullish in 2 years. Consequently, the odds are increasing that the rally will continue up to 1.18 over the next 6 – 12 months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied in a tight bull channel overnight. Day traders have only been buying.<p>However, the legs up over the past 2 hours are becoming smaller and briefer. This loss of momentum means that the bull channel will probably transition into a trading range soon.<p>If it does, the bears will begin to sell reversals down from the top. The bulls will continue to buy, but they will be more inclined to buy 10 – 20 pip pullbacks rather than at the market. Furthermore, they will be starting to take some profits at the high.<p>These changes in behavior are what typically create a trading range. But because of the bull trend, the EURUSD will probably be sideways to up for the rest of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That means traders should expect interest rates to work higher over the next decade.<p>But I keep making the point that a major top on the monthly chart can take several years to complete. Have we seen the top? We might have, but the yearlong bull channel was tight. That reduces the chance that the current 4 month selloff will continue straight down to below the October 2018 low. That is where the tight bull channel began.<p>Instead, it is more likely that the bond market has entered a trading range. It could last for all of 2020.<h3>Bear trend, but trading range likely</h3><p>On the weekly chart above, there have been 3 legs sideways to down. If the current leg falls below the bottom of the 2nd leg, the bears will try for a strong breakout. They then would want a measured move down.<p>It is more likely that there will be buyers around the start of the most recent buy climax. That is the August low. The most recent buy climax low is a common target when there is a reversal down.<p>The weekly chart has been mostly sideways for a few months, even though it is sloping down. This is an early trading range.<p>Furthermore, the monthly chart has had 4 consecutive bear bars. That is extreme, especially after such a strong rally in 2019. These factors make more sideways trading likely over the next several weeks.<h3>Possible truncated wedge bottom</h3><p>The current 4 week leg down does not have to fall below the bottom of the 2nd leg down (the November 7 low). Instead, the bonds could reverse up next week. This leg down would then form a double bottom with the November low.<p>I would also call the 4 month selloff a “truncated wedge.” This is when a chart looks like it is going to form a wedge bottom. However, the 3rd leg down reverses up from just above the bottom of the 2nd leg down. The forces are the same as in a wedge. I therefore like to use the term “wedge.” But since the 3rd leg failed to fall below the 2nd, the wedge is truncated.<p>This means that traders were very confident that there would be a reversal up from below the 2nd leg. In fact, they were afraid that the 3rd leg might not get there. Because the bulls did not want to miss the rally, they began to buy above the bottom of the 2nd leg.<p>Also, the bears who were hoping to take profits below the 2nd leg were worried that there was not much momentum down. They were concerned that they might not be able to exit their shorts below that 2nd leg. They, too, begin to buy just above the bottom of the 2nd leg down.<p>If there are enough buyers, the 3rd leg fails to break below the low of the 2nd. Therefore, the wedge bottom is truncated. But since it is still a wedge variant, traders expect at least a couple legs sideways to up.<h3>Strong selloff so only minor reversal up</h3><p>It is important to note that the weekly chart has been sideways for 11 weeks. Consequently, a bounce could test the top of this developing trading range over the next few weeks. Traders should expect either a bounce from here or from just below the November 7 low.<p>But after 4 consecutive bear bars on the monthly chart, any rally will probably be minor. That means that the trading range should last for at least another month.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>5 month trading range late in 2 year bear trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-rally-testing-bear-trendline-and-1.12-big-round-number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-28-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex rally testing bear trendline and 1.12 big round number\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart has been sideways since early August. Traders are wondering if the 2 year bear trend is finally ending.<p>The bear trend has been in the form of a tight bear channel for 16 months. A bear channel typically has a bull breakout. Then, traders expect the rally to become a bull leg in a developing trading range rather than a new bull trend.<p>The top of the range is usually around the start of the bear channel. That is the September 2018 high at around 1.18.<p>Any rally from here will probably be a leg in a trading range. Traders are not expecting a strong bull breakout and strong follow-through buying.<p>The current 3 month rally is a bull leg within a 6 month trading range. If the rally continues above the bear trend line, it will probably become a bull leg in a bigger trading range. The next major target is that September 2018 high.<p>If the EURUSD gets there, the bulls will take profits and the bears will sell again. Traders should expect a leg down from that level. They would then conclude that the 2 year selloff was just a bear leg in a trading range and not a bear trend. That trading range would have begun with the selloff from the September 2018 high.<h3>Continued trading range in 2020</h3><p>This is the most likely scenario over the coming year. Traders should expect a rally to around 1.18 within several months and then several months of sideways to down trading from there. The bears might get one or two more new lows before the rally to 1.18 begins.<p>Since the EURUSD probably has been in a trading range for 16 months, nothing is clear. Because the range will probably last for most or all of 2020, patterns will continue to be imperfect. Probabilities will be less. Traders will continue to expect reversals every 2 – 3 weeks on the up to the September 2018 high, just like they did on the way down.<p>One final point. There is always an increased chance of a dramatic move in any Forex market at the start of the year. However, because of what I wrote above, a trading range is still most likely for 2020.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong rally, but that could attract profit-takers</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-monthly-SP500-candlestick-chart-has-breakout-above-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly S&amp;P500 candlestick chart has breakout above bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;is forming its 4th consecutive bull trend bar. With only 2 trading days left in December, the month will probably close near its high. The yearlong rally has been a resumption of the strong bull trend that ended with a buy climax in January 2018.<p>That was the most extreme buy climax on the monthly, weekly, and daily charts in the history of the stock market. I talked about that often in late 2017. The result was exhausted bulls. But after a year of sideways trading in 2018, they again bought aggressively throughout 2019, creating trend resumption up.<p>How far can this rally go? The 1st target traders always consider is a measured move. The 2 year trading range was about 600 points tall. A measured move up is 3,575.<p>Will the Emini get there? It might, but it could take more than a year.<h3>What could go wrong?</h3><p>There are several hurdles ahead. First, the inverted yield curve in August is a reliable predictor of a recession. The recession typically starts 1- 2 years later. Since the stock market usually sells off about 6 months before a recession begins, the bulls might not have enough time to reach the measured move target.<p>Also, this is the longest bull trend in the history of the stock market. That reduces the chance of it lasting several more years.<p>Additionally, a trading range late in a bull trend is usually the Final Bull Flag. That means that traders should expect a reversal back down into the 2 year trading range before too long.<p>The breakout often continues for 10 or more bars before the reversal begins. Ten bars on the monthly chart is about a year. Again, there might not be enough time to reach 3,575 before then.<h3>Trading range for the next 10 years</h3><p>I want to make one final point about the unusually strong and long-lasting bull trend. The bulls always keep buying until they are confident that the price is clearly far above what the fundamentals would dictate.<p>They then start to take profits and wait until the fundamentals catch up to the price. They need to see the market go sideways to down for a long time before they conclude that it is once again cheap. That sideways to down trading means that the bull trend evolved into a trading range.<p>The legs in a trading range on the monthly chart can be huge and last a year or more. Look at what happened after strong rally in the late 1960’s and the one in the late 1990’s. Both led to a decade of sideways trading. Furthermore, each trading range had 2 or more selloffs of at least 40%. The selloff in 2009 was 60%.<p>There is no top yet and the Emini could go higher for a year or more. However, traders should expect the trading range to begin within 3 years. Once it does, traders should look to buy 30 – 50% selloffs and take profits on 50 – 100% rallies for the next decade.<h3>Strong bull trend on yearly chart</h3><p>Tuesday is not only the final bar of the month and year, it is also the end of a very strong decade. Think about a yearly chart for a moment where every bar is one year. 2019 is a huge bull trend bar. A huge bull bar on any timeframe often attracts profit-takers. There often is a pause on the next bar.<p>For example, the next bar could be an inside bar. When the next year opens on Wednesday, if the open is below this year’s high, traders might wonder if 2020 will be an inside bar on the yearly chart. If enough think so, then the year would be opening near the high of the coming year. Traders would look for an early selloff, and then sideways to lower prices all year.<p>Alternatively, next year could go above this year’s high, but close at or below this year’s high. If 2020 closed on the low, it would be a sell signal bar on the yearly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices in 2021.<p>If it closed around the middle, it would be a doji bar. That is neutral and it would make more sideways trading likely in 2021.<h3>Possible gap up on yearly and decade charts!</h3><p>Now, here’s a thought. Markets constantly probe. They try to do things that have never been done before. They look for extreme behavior to see how traders will respond. For example, buy and sell climaxes can be extreme. Look at the 1929 Crash and the 2017 buy climax. Both were the most extreme in history.<p>What if next Wednesday gaps up to a new all-time high? There would be a gap up on the monthly chart, like in November. Gaps on the monthly chart are rare.<p>However, there would also be a gap up on the yearly chart. I doubt there has ever been a gap up on the yearly chart that has stayed open. I did not check, but there might never have been a gap up on that chart.<p>Finally, consider a decade chart where each bar is one decade (not shown). A gap up to a new high on Wednesday would create a gap up on that decade chart!<p>I doubt that has ever happened. If it did, it would probably close before the end of the bar. But the bar closes 10 years from now. Therefore a gap up next Wednesday could stay open for several years.<h3>Exhaustion gap or measuring gap?</h3><p>A gap up late in a bull trend usually closes within a few bars. For example, the gap above October’s high will probably close within the next 6 months.<p>However, sometimes the gap stays open for a long time and becomes a measuring gap. It could be a measuring gap on the daily or weekly charts and an exhaustion gap on the monthly, yearly, and decade charts.<p>For example, it could lead to a rally lasting several months and reaching some measured move target on the weekly chart. Then, if there was a reversal over the next many months, the selloff could close the gap. The gap would then be an exhaustion gap on the monthly, yearly, and decade charts.<h3>Parabolic wedge top on the yearly chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-yearly-SP500-candlestick-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-28-3.png\" alt=\"Emini yearly S&amp;P500 candlestick chart has parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>If you look at a yearly chart where each bar is one year, you will notice that the past decade had several breakouts. Each one was followed by a pause. That is a parabolic wedge buy climax and it typically attracts profit-takers. This is especially true when a bar is the biggest bull bar late in the trend, like 2019. Ordinary profit-taking usually results in a 1 – 3 bar pullback. Since this is a yearly chart, a pullback could easily last more than a year.<p>But this is a parabolic wedge buy climax. When it ends, there is often about a 10 bar sideways to down pullback before the bull trend resumes. That is a decade, and it is consistent with I just wrote above. After a parabolic wedge buy climax, the market often goes sideways for about 10 bars. That means the next decade could be a trading range.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Small doji bar indicates loss of momentum</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-weekly-SP500-candlestick-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-28-4.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly S&amp;P500 candlestick chart has parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied strongly for 4 months. However, this week was a small bar with prominent tails. It is relatively neutral, which means a loss of momentum. That is often the first sign of impending profit-taking.<p>Because the bull trend is so strong, if there is profit-taking, it will probably lead to a bull flag or a trading range and not a bear trend. A strong bull trend usually needs at least a micro double top before a bear trend can begin.<p>I mentioned 4 weeks ago that the big doji buy signal bar was a problem. Yes, it was the 1st pullback in a 9 bar bull micro channel. Traders expected at least slightly higher prices.<p>But the big tail on the bottom of a doji bar means that there was strong selling early in that week. That increases the chance of additional selling soon afterwards.<p>When a doji bar is the buy signal bar in a buy climax, the rally usually has more profit-taking within a few bars (here, weeks). This week’s small bar might be the start. Therefore, there is an increased chance of a 1 – 2 week pullback beginning within the next couple weeks.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Parabolic wedge buy climax, but no top yet</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-daily-SP500-candlestick-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-at-3250-big-round-number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-28-5.png\" alt=\"Emini daily S&amp;P500 candlestick chart has parabolic wedge buy climax at 3250 big round number\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart was in a tight trading range for 3 days but resumed up at the end of the week. Christmas week is usually the quietest week of the year, but there typically is at least one strong trend day, like Thursday or Friday. The daily ranges tend to be small and big moves are the exception. With New Year’s being in the middle of next week, next week will probably also be quiet.<h3>Markets pay attention to past behavior</h3><p>Markets often repeat behavior or do the opposite of recent behavior. Last December crashed and January reversed up. The rally began on December 26, 2018.<p>This December is crashing up. That increases the chance of an attempt of a reversal down in January. Friday is a sell signal bar for a parabolic wedge top on the daily chart. It is at the top of a 2 month bull channel and at the 3250 Big Round Number. Finally, Friday was December 27. That is only 1 day after last year’s trend reversal.<p>If the bulls take profits here, traders will expect a brief pullback. There is no strong top yet. Tight bull channels do not typically immediately reverse into bear trends without 1st going sideways for at least a few bars. The best the bears will probably get is a 10 bar tight trading range or bear leg in a broader trading range. Then traders will decide if the selloff is a pullback or the start of a bigger reversal.<h3>The January Barometer and the January Effect</h3><p>The news always talks about the great predictive power of January’s performance. You will hear them talk about the January Barometer. If January is up, the rest of the year has an 82% chance of being up.<p>But remember, the world’s population has constantly increased, as has productivity. That means the world’s wealth continues to increase. The result is that the stock market on a yearly chart has never been in a bear trend. In fact, 65% of all months are up. If there is a strong January, the market has an 82% chance of being up for the remainder of the year. That is not much different from 65%, and it is not different enough to change your trading behavior.<p>The January Effect means that the bulls who sold stock in December for tax reasons will buy stock in January. That theoretically can lead to a January rally. However, most months are up about 0.5 – 1.5%. January is no different. Also, with the year ending strong, there might be some profit-taking in January.<p>What will happen? Who cares? I will trade what I see, not what the news tells me will happen. Therefore, traders should view all of this as having only entertainment value. Listen to it and smile. Just understand that no one makes money trading based on any of these concepts.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There is a parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart. It is at the resistance of the top of the 2 month bull channel and the 3250 Big Round Number.<p>The bears want this year to do the opposite of last Christmas. However, this week is also the end of a very strong decade. Consequently, the odds are against a big selloff from here. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get more than a 1 – 2 week pullback.<p>Since the bulls have been strongly in control for a decade, they are trying to get the decade to close at a new high. The current rally is strong enough so that the Emini will probably be sideways to up through the end of the year (tomorrow).<p>Was Friday’s selloff strong enough to have a 2nd leg down today? Will some bulls take profits just before the end of the year? Both are possible, but the downside risk is currently small.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. The bulls will try to prevent today from trading below Friday’s low. They do not want the sell signal to trigger on the daily chart.<p>Because the bull trend is so strong on the daily chart, there might be more buyers than sellers below Friday’s low. Therefore, even if the sell signal triggers, traders will watch for a possible reversal up from below Friday’s low.<p>It is important to remember that the bulls have been strong for a decade and for a year. The odds are that they will be able to maintain that strength for the remaining 2 days of the decade. They do not need a big rally. They will be satisfied with a quiet, sideways finish to the decade.<p>Because of the traditional holiday lack of energy, the odds favor a lot of time in tight trading ranges today and tomorrow. However, there will still probably be at least one brief sharp move up or down, like on Thursday and Friday.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-30.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-testing-top-of-6-month-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-30-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex testing top of 6 month trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market is at the top of a 6 month trading range. Traders want to see consecutive closes above the top of the range before they conclude that the breakout will succeed.<p>Friday’s rally was strong enough to make at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up likely. Also, Forex markets have an increased chance of breaking out or reversing around the 1st of the year. Consequently, traders will be ready for a big move up or down over the next couple weeks.<p>It is important to remember that markets have inertia. They resist change. I have talked about this repeatedly over the past 18 months. I have kept saying that reversals were more likely than breakouts in channels and trading ranges.<p>That is still true today. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. But the bulls have their best chance over the next couple months in more than a year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied above the December 13 top of the 6 month trading range overnight, but then reversed. The day’s range has only been 30 pips. There is therefore no energy up or down. So far, today is a small day.<p>The bears want the day to close on its low. It would then be a sell signal bar for tomorrow for a failed breakout. Today would be a higher high double top with the December 13 high. If today is a big bear day closing on its low, more traders will be willing to bet on a reversal.<p>Alternatively, if today rallies strongly and closes far above Friday’s high, traders will wonder about a successful breakout. With the small range and the traditional lack of energy around the holidays, today will probably remain a small trading range day. It would therefore not be significant on the daily chart. Traders would then look for guidance over the next few days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

When that happens, traders expect a climactic reversal up for at least a couple hours. That is what happened today.<p>By going below yesterday’s low, the Emini triggered a sell signal on the daily chart. The bears want follow-through selling tomorrow, but the bulls want a failed breakout and a reversal up. The selloff was strong enough to make at least at little bit lower likely this week.<p>Tomorrow is the final day of the month, year, and decade. The Emini is in strong bull trends on all of those time frames. Traders know that a strong close tomorrow will slightly increase the chance of higher prices over at least the next few days. Therefore, the bulls will try to get tomorrow to close at a new all-time high.<p>However, that is probably too far above today’s close for the bulls to get there. But if the Emini is within 10 points in the final hour tomorrow, traders should be ready for a possible Buy The Close rally to a new high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is at the resistance of the top of the 2 month bull channel and the 3250 Big Round Number.<p>The bears want this year to do the opposite of last Christmas. However, this week is also the end of a very strong decade. Consequently, the odds are against a big selloff from here. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get more than a 1 – 2 week pullback.<p>Since the bulls have been strongly in control for a decade, they are trying to get the decade to close at a new high. The current rally is strong enough so that the Emini will probably be sideways to up through the end of the year (tomorrow).<p>Was Friday’s selloff strong enough to have a 2nd leg down today? Will some bulls take profits just before the end of the year? Both are possible, but the downside risk is currently small.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. The bulls will try to prevent today from trading below Friday’s low. They do not want the sell signal to trigger on the daily chart.<p>Because the bull trend is so strong on the daily chart, there might be more buyers than sellers below Friday’s low. Therefore, even if the sell signal triggers, traders will watch for a possible reversal up from below Friday’s low.<p>It is important to remember that the bulls have been strong for a decade and for a year. The odds are that they will be able to maintain that strength for the remaining 2 days of the decade. They do not need a big rally. They will be satisfied with a quiet, sideways finish to the decade.<p>Because of the traditional holiday lack of energy, the odds favor a lot of time in tight trading ranges today and tomorrow. However, there will still probably be at least one brief sharp move up or down, like on Thursday and Friday.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bear-trend-resumption.png\"><img src=\"2019-12-30.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EURUSD-Forex-testing-top-of-6-month-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-30-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex testing top of 6 month trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market is at the top of a 6 month trading range. Traders want to see consecutive closes above the top of the range before they conclude that the breakout will succeed.<p>Friday’s rally was strong enough to make at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up likely. Also, Forex markets have an increased chance of breaking out or reversing around the 1st of the year. Consequently, traders will be ready for a big move up or down over the next couple weeks.<p>It is important to remember that markets have inertia. They resist change. I have talked about this repeatedly over the past 18 months. I have kept saying that reversals were more likely than breakouts in channels and trading ranges.<p>That is still true today. Until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. But the bulls have their best chance over the next couple months in more than a year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied above the December 13 top of the 6 month trading range overnight, but then reversed. The day’s range has only been 30 pips. There is therefore no energy up or down. So far, today is a small day.<p>The bears want the day to close on its low. It would then be a sell signal bar for tomorrow for a failed breakout. Today would be a higher high double top with the December 13 high. If today is a big bear day closing on its low, more traders will be willing to bet on a reversal.<p>Alternatively, if today rallies strongly and closes far above Friday’s high, traders will wonder about a successful breakout. With the small range and the traditional lack of energy around the holidays, today will probably remain a small trading range day. It would therefore not be significant on the daily chart. Traders would then look for guidance over the next few days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini sold off strongly on the open. When that happens, traders expect a climactic reversal up for at least a couple hours. That is what happened today.<p>By going below yesterday’s low, the Emini triggered a sell signal on the daily chart. The bears want follow-through selling tomorrow, but the bulls want a failed breakout and a reversal up. The selloff was strong enough to make at least at little bit lower likely this week.<p>Tomorrow is the final day of the month, year, and decade. The Emini is in strong bull trends on all of those time frames. Traders know that a strong close tomorrow will slightly increase the chance of higher prices over at least the next few days. Therefore, the bulls will try to get tomorrow to close at a new all-time high.<p>However, that is probably too far above today’s close for the bulls to get there. But if the Emini is within 10 points in the final hour tomorrow, traders should be ready for a possible Buy The Close rally to a new high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

By trading below Friday’s low, the Emini triggered a sell signal on the daily chart. There is a parabolic wedge buy climax, and that often attracts profit-takers. The bears want another bear day today. That would confirm the minor reversal and increase the chance of lower prices this week and possibly for 2 weeks.<p>However, the bulls are trying to get the year and the decade to close at a new all-time high. The current high is Friday’s high, but that is probably too far above for the Emini to get there today. However, the bulls have been strong for a year and for a decade. That slightly increases the chance of a trend up today to a new high.<p>New Year’s Eve is often a quiet day. However, there still can be a big move in the final hour. If the Emini is within 10 points of the all-time high going into the final hour, traders should be ready for a possible Buy The Close trend up to a new high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 2 points in the Globex session. New Year’s Eve usually spends a lot of time in a relatively tight range. Yesterday was in a trading range for 6 hours. Today is opening within that range. This increases the chance of a trading range open.<p>Since 90% of days have at least one 4 point swing trade that starts within the 1st couple hours, that is likely again today. However, today will probably spend a lot of time going sideways. If so, that will reduce the number of stop entry setups.<p>Because today is the final day of the year and of the decade, there is an increased chance of a surprisingly big move up or down, especially in the final hour. It is easy to get complacent if the day is in a tight trading range for most of the day. However, the computers are always ready to trade aggressively. Therefore, if there is a strong breakout up or down, day traders should be prepared for a swing trade. Without that, they will expect a trading range day with mostly scalps.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-31.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday closed above the October/December double top.<p>Today will probably have another bull close above that resistance. Traders will therefore look for a test of the next resistance level. That is the August 6 top of the 6 month range.<p>A more important resistance level is the June 25 high (not shown) of 1.1413. This rally is strong enough to make traders believe that it will reach that magnet within a couple months. The odds are increasing that the 2 year bear trend has ended.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied 35 pips overnight in a tight bull channel. That means the bears are not selling and that traders are buying at the market.<p>Because the bars are small and many have prominent tails, the bull trend will probably evolve into a trading range within a hour or so. Once it does, the bulls will switch to buying pullbacks and scalping. Also, if the range is at least 20 pips tall, the bears will begin to sell rallies, hoping for 10 pip scalps.<p>Today is the final day of the year and the decade. While it traditionally is quiet, there is an increased chance of a surprisingly strong move up or down, especially in the final hour. Much more likely is that today will become a relatively tight trading range for the rest of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-strong-rally-at-end-of-month-and-year-and-decade.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-12-31-2.png\" alt=\"Emini strong rally at end of month and year and decade\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.
