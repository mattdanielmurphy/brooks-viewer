This Emini bull bar streak has only happened twice in the 25-year history of the Emini. There has never been a streak of 8 months. September should therefore be a bear bar on the monthly chart.<li>On the monthly cash index chart, there have been 4 streaks of 8 consecutive bull bars in the past 60 years. There has never been a streak of 9 months. Therefore, September or October should be a bear bar on the cash index’s monthly chart.<li>The monthly Emini chart closed on its high in a strong bull trend. That makes at least slightly higher prices likely in September. Also, the market tends to rally from August 26 to September 5. Expect more rally.<li>If there is an early rally, look for a possible reversal down at the end of the month to below the open of the month. This could be the high for the remainder of the year. There are only 4 months left in the year and one will be the high of the year.<li>On the daily chart, yesterday was an inside day (its high was below Monday’s high and its low was above Monday’s low). It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar.<li>Since the bull trend is strong, there are probably buyers not far below yesterday’s low if today were to get there. The bulls will continue to buy every 1- to 3-day pullback, as they have been doing for a year and a half.<li>Because yesterday did not close on its high and it had a bear body, it is not a strong buy signal bar. However, the trend is strong and the odds continue to favor higher prices.<li>The daily chart reached the measured move target based on the height of the pandemic crash. It might stall here for a week or so.<li>Also, there have been 2 legs up from the August 19 low. A rally today would be a 3<sup>rd</sup>leg up. A 3<sup>rd</sup>leg up in a tight bull channel is a parabolic wedge. It often attracts profit takers. Therefore, the upside is probably limited to a few days before there is a 2- to 3-day pullback.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 15 points in the overnight Globex session. If might gap up above the August high.<li>Small gaps typically close before the bar closes. However, if a small gap on the monthly closes, it can do that at any point in the month and not necessarily on the 1<sup>st</sup>day.<li>If there is a gap, there is an increased chance of a trend in either direction. Up is more likely because the bull trend is so strong on all higher time frames.<li>If there is a bull trend, it could be big because the Emini might be making a blow-off top on the daily chart.<li>If there is a bear trend, today could be an inside day because yesterday’s range is small.<li>Today will probably open around the 4537.00 measured move target on the weekly chart, based on the height of the pandemic crash.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Emini-nested-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-1.png\" alt=\"Emini nested parabolic wedge sell climax then trading range.

However, yesterday closed near the low of the bar, although it closed slightly above the August 13 high. It is a reversal bar and a sell signal bar for a failed breakout and for a Low 2 rally from the August 20 low.<li>Yesterday had a bull body and the 8-day rally is in a tight bull channel. Therefore, once there is a reversal down, it will probably be a pullback that forms a higher low instead of a reversal down from a double top bear flag with the August 13 lower high.<li>So far, there were more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low. Today might become an outside up day.<li>The bulls want a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive close above the August 13 high and today to close near its high.

The reversal down today was from just a few ticks above the August high.<li>On the 5-minute chart, the reversal down went below the apex of the triangle that formed over the 1<sup>st</sup>30 bars.<li>Today was a trading range day and a bear reversal day. It closed near the low of the day and it is a sell signal bar on the daily chart.<li>Today formed a micro double top with Monday’s high. However, if there is a reversal down, it will probably be minor. Bulls will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>1- to 3-day selloff, like they have been doing for 18 months.<li>The Emini should work higher in early September, but close below the open of the month. September probably will be the high for the year.

It is a doji bar in a strong trend so probably buyers not far below.<li>The bull trend has been very strong, and therefore traders expect all resistance to fail. Traders will continue to buy every 1- to 3-day pullback until one is so big that traders will conclude that a correction is underway.<li>This weekend is a 3-day holiday weekend. There is often some euphoria ahead of holidays, and the market tends to rally through September 5. There is therefore a slightly increased chance of a bull trend day or a rally at the end of the day.<li>Today’s unemployment report and the 3-day weekend are catalysts that create uncertainty and could lead to a strong trend day in either direction.<li>However, after 4 days with a lot of trading range trading, traders will expect more today unless there is a Trend From The Open.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 3 points in the overnight Globex session, after a 20-point swing after unemployment report. The market is currently moving fast. There have been several big reversals. That increases the chance of an early trading range.<li>The big range increases the chance of at least one swing trade today. It also increases the chance of a big trend day. It can be in either direction.<li>So far, the Emini rallied, sold off, and bounced to retrace 50% of the selloff.<li>Traders see the bounce as a pullback from the selloff from the Globex high. That makes sideways to down trading likely. The size of the selloff is enough to so that traders expect today will not get above the Globex high.<li>As I said above, the Emini is in a strong bull trend, but overbought and it is starting to form bear bars on the daily chart. That increases the chance of a pullback for 1 to 3 days. Today could be the start.<li>I have been saying that September will probably be the high for the year. Is this the start? There have been many other attempts to get a trend reversal on the daily chart and each failed. It is a low probability bet to say that this is the final high.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day with minor sell signal ahead of labor day holiday\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is a doji bar in a strong trend so probably buyers not far below.<li>The bull trend has been very strong, and therefore traders expect all resistance to fail. Traders will continue to buy every 1- to 3-day pullback until one is so big that traders will conclude that a correction is underway.<li>This weekend is a 3-day holiday weekend. There is often some euphoria ahead of holidays, and the market tends to rally through September 5. There is therefore a slightly increased chance of a bull trend day or a rally at the end of the day.<li>Today’s unemployment report and the 3-day weekend are catalysts that create uncertainty and could lead to a strong trend day in either direction.<li>However, after 4 days with a lot of trading range trading, traders will expect more today unless there is a Trend From The Open.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 3 points in the overnight Globex session, after a 20-point swing after unemployment report. The market is currently moving fast. There have been several big reversals. That increases the chance of an early trading range.<li>The big range increases the chance of at least one swing trade today. It also increases the chance of a big trend day. It can be in either direction.<li>So far, the Emini rallied, sold off, and bounced to retrace 50% of the selloff.<li>Traders see the bounce as a pullback from the selloff from the Globex high. That makes sideways to down trading likely. The size of the selloff is enough to so that traders expect today will not get above the Globex high.<li>As I said above, the Emini is in a strong bull trend, but overbought and it is starting to form bear bars on the daily chart. That increases the chance of a pullback for 1 to 3 days. Today could be the start.<li>I have been saying that September will probably be the high for the year. Is this the start? There have been many other attempts to get a trend reversal on the daily chart and each failed. It is a low probability bet to say that this is the final high.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day with minor sell signal ahead of labor day holiday\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EURUSD-Forex-parabolic-wedge-rally-to-double-top-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-3-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex parabolic wedge rally to double top\"></a></figure><ul><li>Strong rally from the August 20 low.<li>10 bars in tight bull channel means strong bulls, but should get pullback within next few days from around July 30 high or June 25 high.<li>Today broke above the July 30 high by a fraction of a pip and then reversed down. The bar could look different at the end of the day, but it is now a bear reversal bar, and there is a wedge rally to a double top. The rally has had 3 legs in a tight bull channel. It is therefore a parabolic wedge, which often attracts profit taking.<li>Bears want double top with July 30 high and then a break below the August low, which is the neckline of the double top.<li>A reversal down would more likely be a pullback from the 2-week rally than a resumption of the bear trend.<li>After a complex bottom, traders will expect a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up. They therefore will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>3- to 5-day pullback, expecting a higher low.<li>It would also be the right shoulder of a head and shoulders bottom where the July 25 low as the left shoulder.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect Tuesday</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trending trading range day\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Consecutive big bull bars on the open and then trading range so Breakout Mode.<li>Rallied in bull channel, but most of the bars were in tight trading ranges.<li>Also was Bull Trending Trading Range Day.<li>1<sup>st</sup>pullback on daily chart in 6 days, but 5-bar tight trading range.<li>Triggered sell signal by falling below yesterday’s low, but yesterday was a weak sell signal bar and today was not a big bear day closing near its low.<li>Today is High 1 buy signal bar, but tail on top and 5-day tight trading range.<li>Odds still favor higher prices, even if more pullback early next week.<li>Remember, the high of the year should come in September.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That has never happened in the Emini. If the month closes below the open, then the streak will be over.<li>September should become the high for the remainder of the year. If not September, then probably October.<li>The weekly Small Pullback Bull Trend has lasted an unusually long time and it therefore should end soon. The biggest pullback was 10% and it happened a year ago.<li>When a Small Pullback Bear Trend ends, it does so with a pullback that is at least 50% bigger. Therefore, traders should expect a 15 to 20% pullback to start within a month or so.<li>The FOMC meeting on September 22 is especially important because the Fed might start to change its language after a couple years of saying the same thing. That meeting is therefore a potential catalyst for a big move up or down.<li>A big move up will probably be a blow-off top.<li>A big move down could be the start of the 15% correction. That correction can begin at any time, including a few weeks after the FOMC announcement. It might have already begun.<li>After 6 days in a tight trading range, traders expect another sideways day. Since this is a Breakout Mode pattern, there can be a big trend day up or down at any time. It will probably begin with a series of strong trend bars in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour. Without that, traders will expect a continuation of the 6-day range.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 6 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>This is now the 3<sup>rd</sup>day down from the all-time high.<li>With most days for 2 weeks spending a lot of time sideways, traders will expect that again today. The small days might continue up to the September 22 FOMC announcement.<li>However, with September likely to be the high for the remainder of the year, there could be an acceleration down or a blow-off top. That means a big trend in either direction can happen at any time.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-Bear-Trend-From-The-Open-then-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-8.png\" alt=\"Emini Bear Trend From The Open then trading range.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EURUSD-Forex-pullback-from-parabolic-wedge-rally-to-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-8-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex pullback from parabolic wedge rally  to double top\"></a></figure><ul><li>Today so far is the 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive bear day after Friday reversed down from a parabolic wedge rally and a double top (with the July 30 high).<li>Today’s low is testing the August 13 high breakout point.<li>After a parabolic wedge, traders should expect a couple small legs sideways to down for a week or two.<li>Targets below are the 50% pullback, the August 27 low, and the July 21 higher low.<li>After 4 days down, the EURUSD should start to go sideways today or tomorrow for at least a couple days before there is a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>The bulls want the reversal to only be sideways for a few days. They then want the bull trend to resume.<li>The bears are hoping that this reversal will fall below the August 20 low, which is the neckline of the July 30/ September 3 double top. They then want the selloff to continue down for a 600-point measured move.<li>The bears only have 30% chance of achieving those goals. There should be buyers between 1.17 and 1.18, and there probably are buyers below the March 2000 low at 1.16.<li>Most likely, the selloff will form a higher low and lead to a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up. However, the EURUSD has been in a tight range for 4 months, and that range is within a yearlong range. There is no evidence that this is about to change. There should be sellers above, around the June 25 high and 1.20.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-8-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>After a wedge rally to the EMA, the Emini sold off for a measured move down and a test of the 4,500 Big Round Number and the August 25 high Breakout Point.<li>The first reversal up from the micro double bottom was minor.<li>The second reversal up was a higher low major trend reversal.<li>There was a Spike and Channel bull trend that tested the open of the day.<li>Today closed just below the open.<li>Today is a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart.<li>However, the setup is weak since today is a doji bar and the daily chart is in a tight trading range.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Bear hoping 15 percent correction has begun.<li>Since it closed near its low and below yesterday’s low, there is an increased chance of follow-through selling today and possibly a gap down.<li>The day after an outside day has an increased chance of having a lot of overlap with the outside day. Remember, an outside day completely overlaps the day before.<li>The day after an outside day is sometimes an inside day. That creates an ioi Breakout Mode pattern. All financial markets might be mostly sideways ahead of the September 22 FOMC announcement.<li>The magnet below is the August 26 low.<li>September or October should begin a 15 to 20% correction, but it will not be clear until it is half over.<li>Until then, traders will continue to buy every reversal down, including this one, betting on another new high.<li>Therefore, there is only a 30% chance at the moment that this week’s selloff is the start of the correction. If there are additional big bear days over the next week, the odds that this is the start of the correction will increase.<li>However, even if there a breakout above 4,600, there is probably not much left to the 18-month rally before there is a correction. That means the next 15% move will more likely be down than up.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Yesterday was rollover day. Day traders should trade the December contract today.<li>Emini is up 19 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Today will probably open in the middle of yesterday’s range. That would increase the chance that today will be an inside day. Even if it breaks above or below yesterday’s range, it will probably not get far beyond that range. Therefore, there will probably be sellers around yesterday’s high and buyers around yesterday’s low.<li>Yesterday was a sell climax day. There is a 75% chance that today will have at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that begins by the end of the 2nd hour.<li>Since today is Friday, weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The most important magnets are last week’s low, yesterday’s low, and the open of the week. That is just above the open of the month, which is another important magnet.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-parabolic-wedge-top-and-then-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-10.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge top and then outside down day.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EURUSD-Forex-should-have-2nd-leg-sideways-to-down-after-parabolic-wedge-and-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-10-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>Still pulling back from parabolic wedge rally to a double top.<li>Traders expect at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down, especially after 3 consecutive bear days.<li>2-day rally will probably form lower high within a few days.<li>Selloff could reach August 28 buy climax low within a couple weeks and a 50% retracement before bulls will buy.<li>After sell climax bottom on August 20, should get 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up for a few weeks. It should begin once this pullback from the September 3 high ends within the next week.<li>The bulls want a break above the June 25 high and then a measured move up to the January high. That is the top of the yearlong trading range.<li>Finally, they want a break of the February 2018 high of 1.2555. That is the high of the 7-year trading range on the monthly chart.<li>Then, they want a 2000-pip measured move up. That would take years. Over the next several months, traders expect the yearlong trading range from 1.16 to 1.23 to continue.<li>Bears want the July 30/September 3 double top to lead to a resumption of the bear trend. They want a break below the August 20 low, which is the neck line of the double top.

There is also an expanding triangle and a trend channel line overshoot. September or October should be the high of the year and the start of a 15 – 20% correction. There is a 40% chance that it is underway.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex is pulling back from the top of its 3-month trading range. The bears are looking for a resumption of the bear trend to below the November 2020’s low. However, after 2 strong bull bars and a wedge bottom, it is more likely that there will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up.<h2>EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3>The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-double-top-bear-flag-but-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-12.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has double top bear flag but in trading range\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s candlestick on the weekly EURUSD Forex chart was a bear inside bar closing near the low.<li>The yearlong trading range is both a head and shoulder top and a bull flag. Traders are deciding on the direction of the ultimate breakout.<li>There is no evidence that the breakout is about to begin. Traders are looking for reversals ever week or two.<li>Bears want the July 30/September 3 double top bear flag to lead to a resumption of the bear trend to below the November 2020 low, followed by a 700-pip measured move down.<li>After 2 consecutive strong bull bars and a reversal up from the bear channel and March low, the odds favor at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up from above the August low.<li>The bulls want a break above the June 25 high and then a measured move up to the January high. That is the top of the yearlong trading range.<li>Most breakouts from trading ranges fail. Markets have inertia and tend to continue what they have been doing.&nbsp;<li>Therefore, the yearlong trading range is likely to continue. That means there should be a rally for a couple of months beginning, but there might first be a brief break below the August or November low.</ul><h2>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3>The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-so-far-has-bear-bar-in-September-after-streak-of-7-bull-bars.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-12-1.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart so far has bear bar in September after streak of 7 bull bars\"></a></figure><ul><li>The candlestick on the monthly Emini chart so far is a small bear bar closing near its low.<li>August was the 3<sup>rd</sup>time in the 25-year history of the Emini when there was a streak of 7 consecutive bull bars. On the monthly chart of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-gb/instruments/us-spx-500-cash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">S&amp;P500 cash index</a>, there has only been 6 times in over 60 years when there was a streak of 8 bull bars. There has not been a streak of 9 bars in that time. September or October should be a bear bar.<li>If September or October is a bear bar, it should lead to a 2- to 3-month correction of 15 to 20%.&nbsp;<li>The odds of a correction increase if the bear bar has a big bear body and closes near the low.<li>While the current candlestick is a bear bar, it is still early in the month and the appearance of the bar can be different by the end of the month. This is especially true with the September 22 FOMC being a potential catalyst for a big move in either direction.<li>Will this month turn into a bigger bear bar? For example, will it trade below the August low and become an outside down bar? Or will the bulls buy the dip again, creating a tail below the bar and another bull bar?<li>The bears have not yet been able to create a bear bar or even a bull bar with a prominent tail on top for 7 months. This is a sign of eager and relentless buying.<li>The move-up is in a tight bull channel, and September is following a 7-bar bull micro-channel. Because of this, traders will buy the first pullback, even if it lasts a few months and falls more than 20%.</ul><h3>The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-so-far-has-bear-bar-at-top-of-channel-and-at-measured-move-target.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-12-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week’s Emini candlestick was a bear bar reversing down from the top of the wedge bull channel and the measured move target based on the pandemic crash.<li>Because the Emini closed near the low of the week, next week could gap down, creating a gap on the weekly chart.<li>Bears need to break the trend line strongly around the 4410 area to convince other traders that a correction may be underway.<li>Next week is the follow-through bar. If it is a big bear bar that closes near its low, a 2-legged sideways to down correction of at least 15% will probably be underway. Traders will see it as a sign that the bulls are starting to take profits aggressively.<li>The bulls want next week to be a bull bar closing near its high. If it is, there will probably be another new high before the correction begins.<li>The Emini has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for more than 60 bars, which is unusual, and therefore unsustainable and climactic.<li>The 2 common ways for a tight bull channel to end are either with a break below the bull trend line (bottom of the channel) or a failed breakout above the channel.<li>Traders will conclude that the Small Pullback Bull Trend has ended once there is a big pullback. The biggest pullback so far was the 10% selloff in September 2020. A bigger pullback means 15 to 20%.</ul><h3>The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-is-reversing-down-from-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-12-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart is reversing down from top of bull channel.

Traders bought every one, correctly betting against a successful reversal.<li>There are currently several things that increase the chance of a correction this time.<li>The most important one is the monthly chart.

This is not a particularly strong buy setup.<li>Because the Emini is just above the 50-day MA, it might have to go sideways to down to get there. Many traders are not convinced that it has been adequately tested, especially after 4 big bear days.<li>Since the 50-day EMA has been reliable support for over a year, there will probably be buyers not far below yesterday’s low.<li>However, there is a 50% chance that September 2 will remain the high for the rest of 2021.<li>A 15 to 20% correction is likely to begin in September or October and it might be underway. If it is, there could be a collapse below the 50-day MA and bottom of the bull channel before there is a new all-time high.<li>After 4 sideways days and with a weak buy and sell setup, the Emini has an increased chance of going mostly sideways and a little up into next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 2 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was an inside day and the 4<sup>th</sup>sideways day. That increases the chance of another mostly sideways day. However, even if it is, the daily ranges have been big enough for swings in both directions.<li>With today opening in the middle of yesterday’s range, it could be a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive inside day. There would then be an ii (inside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC announcement.<li>4 sideways days also increases the chance of sellers near yesterday’s high and buyers near yesterday’s low.<li>Since today is Friday, weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. So far, this week is a small bear doji candlestick. Therefore, the open of the week is important.<li>The bulls want a bull reversal bar on the weekly chart. They would also like this week to get back above the 4500 Big Round Number and the open of the month.<li>The bears want the week to close on the low, below the bottom of the now 5-day tight trading range, the 50-day MA, and the bottom of the bull channel on the weekly chart.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-Failed-BO-below-Parabolic-Wedge-Then-Bull-Trend-Reversal-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-17.png\" alt=\"Emini Failed BO below Parabolic Wedge, Then Bull Trend Reversal.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EURUSD-Forex-micro-wedge-and-possible-head-and-shoulders-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-17-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday was a big bear day closing in its bottom third, but just 3 pips below the September 13 bull flag attempt.<li>This is disappointing for the bears.<li>Bears want a bear day today, which would confirm the breakout below Monday’s bull flag.

They prefer a close above the open of the month, but that is about 100 points away.<li>While the current candlestick is a big bear bar, there are 9 more trading days left in the month and the appearance of the bar can be different by the end of the month. This is especially true with the September 22 FOMC statement being a potential catalyst for a big move in either direction.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-the-1st-pair-of-big-bear-bars-closing-near-their-lows-since-the-pandemic-crash.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-19-3.png\" alt=\"Emini consecutive bear bars on weekly chart are 1st pair of big bear bars closing near their lows since the pandemic crash\"></a></figure><ul><li>This weekly Emini candlestick chart has the 1<sup>st</sup>pair of big bear bars closing on their lows since the pandemic crash. This week also closed below the bull trend channel. There is a 50% chance that a 15% correction has begun.<li>Because the Emini closed near the low of the week, next week could gap down, creating a gap on the weekly chart.&nbsp;<li>Bears need to see follow-through selling and a close near the low next week to convince other traders that a 2-legged sideways to down correction of at least 15% is underway. Traders will see it as a sign that the bulls are starting to take profits aggressively.<li>If the bears get that, it would be 3 consecutive bear bars on the weekly chart, something that has not happened since the pandemic crash and would bolster the bear’s case.&nbsp;<li>The bulls want next week to be a bull bar closing near its high and for the breakout below the trend line to fail. The bulls know that in a strong trend, most reversal attempts fail and are hoping that it will be the same again this time.<li>There is a 50% chance that September 2 will remain the high for the rest of 2021. Since there is a 50% chance that the September 2 high will be the high of the year, there is a 50% chance that a 15% correction is underway.&nbsp;<li>A 50% chance of September 2 being the high of the year means a 50% chance there will be a new high.&nbsp;<li>The Emini has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for more than 60 bars, which is unusual, and therefore unsustainable and climactic.<li>Traders will conclude that the Small Pullback Bull Trend has ended once there is a big pullback. The biggest pullback so far was the 10% selloff in September 2020. A bigger pullback typically means 15 to 20%, and that is why the correction should be at least 15%.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-reversing-down-from-top-of-bear-channel-possible-to-April-2-gap-at-4000-big-round-number-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-19-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart reversing down from top of bear channel possible to April 2 gap at 4000 big round number.\"></a></figure><ul><li>Friday’s candlestick on the daily Emini chart closed below the 50-day moving average and just above the bottom of the bull channel.<li>Because the Emini closed near the low of the week, next week could gap down below the bull trend line and 50-day moving average.<li>If the bears get consecutive bear bars closing on their lows and below these support levels, traders will conclude that the correction is underway.&nbsp;<li>A correction typically is about half over by the time traders believe it is taking place.<li>The next target for the bears is the August 19 low.<li>If this is the start of a 15% correction, a possible target for the bears is the April 2 high at the bottom of the gap up above the 4000 big round number. That would be 12% down from the September 2 high.<li>The move down since September 2 is in a tight bear channel but with many overlapping bars. The overlapping bars mean that the bears are not yet as strong as they could be. However, since it is in a tight bear channel with many consecutive bear bars and big bear bars, there should be a second leg sideways to down after any pullback (bounce).<li>There is a 50% chance that September 2 will remain the high for the rest of 2021.&nbsp;<li>Since there is a 50% chance that the September 2 high will be the high of the year, there is a 50% chance that a 15% correction is underway. If it is, there could be a collapse below the 50-day moving average and bottom of the bull channel before there is a new all-time high.<li>Therefore, there is an increased chance of a big selloff at any time. For example, next week might gap down below the 50-day moving average and the bull channel, or the Emini could sell-off on Wednesday’s FOMC announcement.<li>A 50% chance of September 2 being the high of the year means a 50% chance there will be a new high.&nbsp;<li>With the Emini at the 50-day moving average and just above the bull trend line, the bulls are hoping for another reversal up, like after every prior test of the 50-day moving average since the pandemic crash.</ul><h2 id=\"9-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is a Low 1 sell signal bar for today. The bulls, however, see it as a pullback from Monday’s strong reversal up from major support in a bull trend. Today’s FOMC statement report is a catalyst for a big move in either direction.<li>Traders are deciding if a 15% correction to below 4,000 has begun or if the selloff is just another one of many sharp selloffs since the pandemic crash. Traders bought every one, and they soon had a new high.<li>This is the 1<sup>st</sup>one to reach the 100-day MA since last October.<li>Additionally, the monthly chart should have consecutive bear bars starting in September or October because of the unusual streak of bull bars.<li>Therefore, this is different from all of the past selloffs. There is a 50% chance that September 2 will remain the high for 2021.<li>The 50-day MA has been support since last year’s reversal up. Monday’s selloff fell far enough below so that it might now be resistance. The Emini might test it today before or after the FOMC report.<li>There will probably be at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down within a week or so. However, if today’s FOMC announcement leads to a strong rally, Monday might be a V-bottom and the end of the selloff.<li>If there is a new high within the next few weeks, it will probably fail above 4600. August would then be a Final Bull Flag.<li>Since the 100-day MA was support on Monday, the Emini might have to go sideways for a couple weeks as traders decide if the 100-day support is more important than the 50-day resistance.<li>It is common for a market to enter a trading range once it has a big reversal down from a buy climax. Traders then decide if the bull trend will resume or reverse.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 25 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a triangle and there was a small bear breakout at the end of the day. Today might open with a bull breakout after a failed bear breakout. That would increase the chance of a rally today.<li>Today will open around the 60-minute EMA, which might be resistance.<li>Magnets above are the 50-day MA on the daily chart and Friday’s low, which is the top of Monday’s big gap. Also, the midpoint of August is a magnet, and it is around those 2 other prices.<li>There is an FOMC statement report at 11 am PT today.<li>Trade the day like any other day until then, but day traders should exit ahead of the report. This is because there is a 75% chance of a big move in both directions in the 1<sup>st</sup>10 minutes after the report.<li>Day traders can resume looking for trades after the 1<sup>st</sup>10 minutes.<li>Be open to anything. A relentless trend for the rest of the day in either direction only happens 20% of the time.<li>Therefore, expect at least one reversal.<li>About 10% of the time, there is no significant move after the report and the Emini just goes sideways.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-Trading-range-day-that-closed-on-its-low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-22.png\" alt=\"Emini Trading range day that closed on its low ahead of FOMC statement report.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EURUSD-tight-trading-range-and-head-and-shoulders-bottom-ahead-of-FOMC.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-22-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD tight trading range and head and shoulders bottom ahead of FOMC\"></a></figure><ul><li>There is an FOMC statement report at 11 am PT.

It is a Low 1 sell signal bar for today. The bulls, however, see it as a pullback from Monday’s strong reversal up from major support in a bull trend. Today’s FOMC statement report is a catalyst for a big move in either direction.<li>Traders are deciding if a 15% correction to below 4,000 has begun or if the selloff is just another one of many sharp selloffs since the pandemic crash. Traders bought every one, and they soon had a new high.<li>This is the 1<sup>st</sup>one to reach the 100-day MA since last October.<li>Additionally, the monthly chart should have consecutive bear bars starting in September or October because of the unusual streak of bull bars.<li>Therefore, this is different from all of the past selloffs. There is a 50% chance that September 2 will remain the high for 2021.<li>The 50-day MA has been support since last year’s reversal up. Monday’s selloff fell far enough below so that it might now be resistance. The Emini might test it today before or after the FOMC report.<li>There will probably be at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down within a week or so. However, if today’s FOMC announcement leads to a strong rally, Monday might be a V-bottom and the end of the selloff.<li>If there is a new high within the next few weeks, it will probably fail above 4600. August would then be a Final Bull Flag.<li>Since the 100-day MA was support on Monday, the Emini might have to go sideways for a couple weeks as traders decide if the 100-day support is more important than the 50-day resistance.<li>It is common for a market to enter a trading range once it has a big reversal down from a buy climax. Traders then decide if the bull trend will resume or reverse.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 25 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a triangle and there was a small bear breakout at the end of the day. Today might open with a bull breakout after a failed bear breakout. That would increase the chance of a rally today.<li>Today will open around the 60-minute EMA, which might be resistance.<li>Magnets above are the 50-day MA on the daily chart and Friday’s low, which is the top of Monday’s big gap. Also, the midpoint of August is a magnet, and it is around those 2 other prices.<li>There is an FOMC statement report at 11 am PT today.<li>Trade the day like any other day until then, but day traders should exit ahead of the report. This is because there is a 75% chance of a big move in both directions in the 1<sup>st</sup>10 minutes after the report.<li>Day traders can resume looking for trades after the 1<sup>st</sup>10 minutes.<li>Be open to anything. A relentless trend for the rest of the day in either direction only happens 20% of the time.<li>Therefore, expect at least one reversal.<li>About 10% of the time, there is no significant move after the report and the Emini just goes sideways.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-Trading-range-day-that-closed-on-its-low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-22.png\" alt=\"Emini Trading range day that closed on its low ahead of FOMC statement report.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EURUSD-tight-trading-range-and-head-and-shoulders-bottom-ahead-of-FOMC.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-22-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD tight trading range and head and shoulders bottom ahead of FOMC\"></a></figure><ul><li>There is an FOMC statement report at 11 am PT. That usually results in a sharp move in both directions within the 1<sup>st</sup>10 minutes. Therefore, day traders should exit ahead of the report and wait at least 10 minutes before day trading again.<li><a href=\"https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A FOMC statement report</a>is sometimes a catalyst for a big move that can last for several days.<li>Today so far is a small inside day and the past 2 days were also small after consecutive big bear bars closing near their lows. That is a Bear Surprise Breakout, and there is typically at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down.<li>That 2<sup>nd</sup>leg is sometimes just a single bar.<li>If today sells off and reverses up, it will create a micro double bottom with Monday’s low. If today then closes near its high, it would be a buy signal bar.<li>Traders would wonder if the Bear Surprise was simply a bear trap and another test of the bottom of the yearlong trading range.<li>A reversal up would be a higher low major trend reversal. A major reversal setup with a good signal bar has a 40% chance of actually leading to a trend reversal. In 60% of instances, it leads to a continuation of the trading range or a resumption of the selloff.<li>Additionally, it would be the right shoulder of a head and shoulders bottom. The August 11 low would be the left shoulder and the August 20 low would be the head.<li>Markets have inertia. They tend to continue what they have been doing.<li>The EURUSD has been a 200-pip trading range for 4 months. That trading range is at the bottom of a 700-pip yearlong trading range.<li>Since the EURUSD is near the bottom of both, there is an increase chance of a reversal up within a few weeks. It could come at any time.<li>There might be a dip first below the November 4, 2020 bottom of the range.<li>Traders will need a couple big bear bars closing on their lows and below that low before they concluding that the bear breakout was likely to succeed.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range-that-continued-after-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then trading range that continued after FOMC announcement\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>The Emini began with a Major Bull Surprise and rallied in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. It was also a Spike and Channel Bull Trend.<li>The rally ended with a big doji bar and a buy climax.<li>There was a 2<sup>nd</sup>Major Bull Surprise Bar on the FOMC announcement. After a 1-bar 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up to just above the 4,400 Big Round Number and just below the top of the gap below Friday’s low, the Emini reversed down from a higher high major trend reversal.<li>It was in a trading range since 9 am PT, and it remained sideways after the FOMC.<li>It was a bull bar on the daily chart, but it had a big tail on top. This is a weak Low 1 sell signal bar.<li>The Emini might have to test above the 50-day MA before the bears will try for a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down.<li>There is still a 50% chance that the rally will form a lower high and be followed by a 15% correction.<li>If the bulls begin to get bull bars closing near their highs, the odds of another new all-time high will increase.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That typically results in a trading range.<li>Increased chance of a trading range over the next couple weeks. A trading range usually has at least a double top and a double bottom.<li>Bulls want the strong reversal up from 100-day MA, the September low and the 4300 Big Round Number to be a V-bottom. They want the rally to quickly go to a new high.<li>The bulls want the week to close near its high so that this week will be a strong buy signal bar on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<li>If the Emini September rally continues for several more days, the rally will probably continue up to a new high.<li>After 7 consecutive bull bars on the monthly chart, there should be a couple consecutive bear bars starting in September or October.<li>That would likely end the Small Pullback Bull Trend on the weekly chart. That means there should be a pullback that is at least 50% bigger than the biggest prior pullback, which was a 10% pullback in October 2020. Therefore, there should be at least a 15% pullback.<li>There is currently a 50% chance that the pullback has begun. The more big bull bars over the coming days, the more likely the Emini will soon make a new high.<li>If it does, then the August trading range will probably be the Final Bull Flag on the daily chart. Then, the 15% correction should begin in October.<li>Less likely, the bulls will get 8 or more consecutive bull bars on the monthly chart, which has never happened in the 25-year history of the Emini.<li>The open of the month is probably too far above for the Emini to get there next week, the final week of September.<li>September should have a bear body. However, the bulls will try to have it close above the midpoint of the month. If so, it would increase the chance of October being sideways instead of down.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 15+ points in the overnight Globex session. It is possibly continuing its strong reversal up.<li>If today gaps up above yesterday’s high, and if gap is small, it will probably close early in the day.<li><span style=\"color:initial\">Over the final week of September, traders will begin to think about monthly support and resistance. At a minimum, the bulls want September to close above the midpoint of the month, which is just below Friday’s low and just above yesterday’s high.</span><li>Since traders are deciding if September will be the high, what happens over the next few days will be important.<li>If the bulls continue to get bull days, the rally will probably lead to a new high.<li>If the Emini will be sideways or down over the next few weeks, the bulls should be disappointed today or tomorrow. That means a bear day.<li>If there are two or more bear days within the next few days, the Emini will probably be sideways into the end of the month.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range-that-continued-after-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-23.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then trading range that continued after FOMC announcement.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/EURUSD-Forex-higher-low-double-bottom-major-trend-reversal-and-High-4-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-23-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex higher low double bottom major trend reversal and High 4 bottom\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD formed an outside down bar yesterday.<li>Today so far is a bull day.

The biggest pullback so far was the 10% selloff in September 2020. A bigger pullback typically means 15 to 20%, and that is why the correction should be at least 15%.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Emini-Daily-Chart-25th-September-2021-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-9-26-4.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Daily Chart - Emini Reversal Up From 100-Day Moving Average\"></a></figure><ul><li>Monday gapped down on the daily and weekly charts and sold off strongly to far below the weekly bull channel (not shown) and the 50-day MA (not shown). It reversed up from below the 100-day MA, the 4300 Big Round Number, and below the August 19 and the August 3 lows, which means the August low.<li>Traders are deciding if a 15% correction to below 4,000 has begun or if the selloff is just another one of many sharp selloffs since the pandemic crash. Traders bought every one, and they soon had a new high.<li>The 50-day MA (not shown) has been support since last year’s reversal up. Monday’s selloff fell far enough below so that it might now be resistance.&nbsp;<li>Since the 100-day MA was support on Monday, the Emini might have to go sideways for a couple of weeks as traders decide if the 100-day MA support is more important than the 50-day MA resistance.&nbsp;<li>It is common for a market to enter a trading range once it has a big reversal down from a buy climax. Big reversal up after big reversal down creates big confusion. That typically results in a trading range. Traders will then decide if the bull trend will resume or reverse.&nbsp;<li>Monday might be a V-bottom and the end of the selloff if the bulls can get consecutive big bull bars closing on their highs next week.<li>If there is a new high within the next few weeks, it will probably fail above 4600. September would then be a Final Bull Flag.<li>The bears want at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down within a week or so.<li>There is a 50% chance that September 2 will remain the high for the rest of 2021.&nbsp;<li>Since there is a 50% chance that the September 2 high will be the high of the year, there is a 50% chance that a 15% correction is underway. A 50% chance of September 2 being the high of the year means a 50% chance there will be a new high.&nbsp;</ul><h2 id=\"8-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
