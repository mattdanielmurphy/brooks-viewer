However, the Emini is back at the yesterday’s high in the Globex session, and therefore April might gap up in the day session on the monthly chart.<li>If there is a gap up, the gap on the monthly chart will be small.<li>Small gaps typically close before the bar closes. That means the gap will likely close by the end of April. If not, then probably within a few bars (months).<li>January and February had tails on top of the bars on the monthly chart.

The bulls need follow-through buying next week, to increase the chance that the rally will continue up to measured move targets at around 4,200. Because the Emini gapped up and is overbought on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts, and at a major Big Round Number, there can be a pullback at any time. The bears need at least a couple big bear days before traders will expect more than a shallow pullback.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex monthly chart is continuing its reversal down from a yearlong wedge top. It is now in last year’s trading range, and near the bottom of the final leg up of the wedge. This is a support zone, and it increases the chance of a bounce for a couple weeks in April.<h2 id=\"1-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-eurusd-monthly-chart-has-sell-climax-in-support-zone\">The EURUSD<em>monthly</em>chart has sell climax in support zone</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-sell-climax-at-support-so-short-covering-rally-likely-soon.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart in sell climax at support so short covering rally likely soon\"></a></figure><ul><li>Turning down from a wedge rally to a lower high double top with the February 2018 high.<li>Selloff from a wedge top typically has at least a couple legs down.<li>First target is bottom of final leg up in the wedge.

The sideways move can last a few bars or many bars.<li>The breakout above 1,000 came in 1998 (not shown). The stock market entered a big trading range, and did not get above 2,000 until 2014. It then went sideways for 2 years.<li>It broke above 3,000 in 2019 and went sideways for a year.<li>While the current breakout could continue up for many months, the Emini will probably be sideways around 4,000 for many months. It could get stuck here for more than a year.</ul><h4 id=\"6-gap-up-on-monthly-chart\">Gap up on monthly chart</h4><ul><li>April gapped above the March high. All gaps on the monthly chart are small. Most small gaps close before the end of the month, like in December 2020.<li>If gap does not close by end of month, it usually closes within a few months, like the gaps in November 2019 and August 2020.</ul><h4 id=\"7-targets-for-bulls-and-bears\">Targets for bulls and bears</h4><ul><li>Bulls want the gap to be a measuring gap. They hope that gap will remain open, and lead to a 700-point measured move up, based on the height of the wedge that began in September.<li>They additionally want a 1,200 measured move up based on the height of the 2018/2020 expanding triangle. While the Emini will eventually get there (and to 10,000 and 100,000!), it will probably have several pullbacks first.<li>More likely, there will be a 2-month pullback soon, instead of a quick measured move up.<li>There were tails on the top of January and February. They were caused by reversals as the bars were forming.<li>March did not reverse, but 2-bar reversals are common. If April were to selloff, it would form a 2-bar reversal with March.<li>That would create a micro wedge top with the January and February highs, which would increase the chance of a pullback in May.<li>There has only been a single pullback since the pandemic low. Only one bar (September) fell below the low of the prior bar (month).<li>Pullbacks tend to be more complex as trends mature. Next pullback will probably last at least a couple months.<li>Most recent bars on the monthly chart have been 200 – 500 points tall. A 2-bar pullback will probably be 10 – 20%.<li>There is currently only a 20% chance that the 1<sup>st</sup>pullback will be 35%, like last year’s February/March pullback.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-in-strong-small-pullback-bull-trend\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart in strong Small Pullback Bull Trend</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-consecutive-bull-bars-at-top-of-bull-channel-with-measured-move-target-above-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart has consecutive bull bars at top of bull channel with measured move target above.png\"></a></figure><ul><li>The past 2 weeks were big bull bars closing on their highs.<li>As strong as the bull trend has been for the past year, this is an acceleration up.<li>There are 2 ways to draw the channel. The Emini is breaking above the longer-term bull channel (red line), and it is just below the channel based on the November 9/February 16 highs (green line).<li>Next magnet is the measured move up to 4,195, based on the January 29/March 4 double bottom bull flag.<li>Above that is a measured move at 4,244, based on the gap created by the September 25 breakout test of the June 5 high.<li>A reversal down from a Small Pullback Bull Trend is typically minor. That means a couple legs sideways to down. But a pullback could last a couple months, like in September and October last year.<li>1<sup>st</sup>target for the bears is the January/March double bottom at 3,700.<li>If the pullback continues down, the next target is the November 10 low at 3,500 at the start of the tight bull channel.</ul><h4 id=\"9-possible-blow-off-top-exhaustive-buy-climax\">Possible blow-off top (exhaustive buy climax)</h4><ul><li>Small Pullback Bull Trend that has lasted 50 bars, and begins to accelerate up, often reverses down from a blow-off top. That is an exhaustive buy climax.<li>Stop for the bulls is far below. Easiest way to reduce risk is to take some profits. If enough bulls take profits, there is often a pullback with a couple legs down.<li>Currently no sign of a top, but at top of bull channel.<li>Until there is a strong reversal down, higher prices are likely.<li>Most likely will begin to pull back soon.<li>Alternatively, will break strongly to the upside. Then, 75% chance the profit taking would soon begin.</ul><h4 id=\"10-what-could-cause-a-strong-breakout-above-the-bull-channel\">What could cause a strong breakout above the bull channel?</h4><ul><li>Late in a bull channel, bears expect the bulls to take profits. Bears begin to short.<li>If bulls do not take profits and instead continue to buy, channel continues up.<li>At some point, weak bears become worried that this will be one of the 25% of cases where there is a successful breakout into a stronger bull trend.<li>They buy back their shorts in a panic. This creates a sharp rally above the bull channel.<li>75% chance that a bull breakout above a bull channel, will begin to turn down within about 5 bars.<li>This is because bulls see it as a great chance to take windfall profits, and they know the breakout will probably be brief, and then reverse down.<li>Also, the strong bears bet that the breakout will fail. They scale into shorts, and they are never going to buy them back until they are profitable.<li>With no weak bears left to buy back shorts, and with bulls starting to sell, there can be a sharp reversal down, like in early 2018.<li>1<sup>st</sup>reversal down from an exhaustive buy climax typically has at least 2 legs sideways to down. Sideways is more likely. The pullback will probably be 10%, but it might be 20%.<li>Traders then decide if the pullback is a bull flag, or if it will become a lower high major trend reversal.</ul><h3 id=\"11-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-broke-above-4000-big-round-number\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke above 4,000 Big Round Number</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-s-at-top-of-bull-channel-with-measured-move-target-above.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-3-3.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>Breaking above March 17/March 26 double top, and above 4,000 Big Round Number.<li>Bulls need follow-through buying on Monday to increase chance of successful breakout.<li>But streak of 6 consecutive bull bars is unusual, and therefore climactic.

Increased chance of bear bar today or soon.<li>Most days for several weeks have had at least one swing up, and one swing down, so that is likely today.<li>Since market is at such an unusual Big Round Number, increased chance of surprisingly big move up or down.

But bull trend, so higher prices likely.<li>Today will probably gap up on both the daily and weekly charts.<li>Since extreme buy climax on both charts, increased chance of 2 or 3 sideways days.

Traders expect sideways for at least a few days, but could continue to rally for a week first.<li>This is only the 4<sup>th</sup>multiple of 1,000 in the 100-year history of the S&amp;P so this is a rare event.<li>Thursday gapped up, which means there is a small gap on the monthly chart. Small gaps usually close before the bar closes, and therefore the gap should close this month. If not, then probably within a few months.<li>Buy climaxes on daily, weekly, and monthly charts, but no top. Traders will continue to expect higher prices until strong reversal down.<li>Streak of 6 consecutive bull bars on daily is unusual, and therefore unsustainable, and climactic. Increased chance of bear bar today or soon.<li>Most days for several weeks have had at least one swing up, and one swing down, so that is likely today.<li>Since market is at such an unusual Big Round Number, increased chance of surprisingly big move up or down. Remember, there are only 3 other data points (1,000, 2,000, and 3,000) in the history of the stock market, so not enough to have an opinion about what will happen based on the multiple of 1,000 alone. But bull trend, so higher prices likely.<li>Today will probably gap up on both the daily and weekly charts.<li>Since extreme buy climax on both charts, increased chance of 2 or 3 sideways days.

That would create an island top. But, most island tops are minor reversal patterns.<li>When there is a big gap up and a breakout, the Emini typically goes sideways for 2 to 3 days, starting within a couple days of the breakout. However, this rally is accelerating up, and could quickly go higher.<li>Sometimes a strong breakout, like over the past 3 weeks, accelerates up and then reverses down strongly from a blow-off top.<li>If the Emini continues up strongly this week, a blow-off top will become likely, like in late 2017. Smaller versions formed in June and September last year. Each led to about a 10% pullback over a couple weeks.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Down 7 points in the Globex session.<li>Probably will open within yesterday’s trading range, so Breakout Mode.<li>Bulls want a measured move up, and bears want a measured move down.<li>Day after big breakout day tends to be sideways.<li>If today is sideways, increased chance of close below the open since there are already 7 consecutive bull days on the daily chart, which is unusual.<li>Therefore, if today is within 10 points of open in the final hour, Emini will probably get drawn to the open.

A streak that only happens about once a year. It is therefore unsustainable and climactic. Should get bear day this week.<li>8 days with low above low of prior day so 9-day bull micro channel. This also only happens about once a year. Traders have been so eager to buy, that they have been buying above the prior day’s low for 8 days. Should get pullback within a few days.<li>Bulls normally would be eager to buy below yesterday’s low once they get a chance. However, when a buy climax is this extreme, a sharp reversal can come at any time. Look at June 5, September 2, and October 12 as examples of buy climaxes that led to big, abrupt reversals.<li>No sign of a top, and no pullback on daily chart in 2 weeks. Traders are so eager to buy pullbacks that the pullbacks are only coming intraday.<li>3 sideways days, so increased chance of a breakout up or down today.<li>Unless there is a series of strong trend bars, day traders will expect at least one reversal again today.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Up 8 points in Globex session so probably will gap up again today. Likely gap up to another all-time high.<li>Extremely overbought, but daily chart is in a blow-off top, and therefore can get more overbought.<li>If there is a rally on the open, increased chance of midday or late reversal down.<li>If there is a series of strong bear bars in 1<sup>st</sup>2 hours, could get big bear trend day because of how overbought daily chart is.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-trading-range-day-closing-on-its-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-8.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day closing on its high.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EURUSD-Forex-minor-rally-from-wedge-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-8-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex minor rally from wedge bottom\"></a></figure><ul><li>Possible micro double top in 4-month bear channel.<li>After wedge bottom, 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up likely. If there is a selloff, it will probably only last a few days, and reverse back up from a higher low.<li>Reversal up from wedge bottom typically has at least 2 legs up, and it usually reaches the top of the most recent sell climax. That is the March 18 high at the 1.20 Big Round Number.</ul><h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Traded a fraction of a pip below yesterday’s low and reversed up.<li>In very tight trading range overnight. Day traders are buying reversals up, and selling reversals down from 10-pip scalps.<li>Day traders will continue to scalp unless there is a strong breakout up or down, which is unlikely today.<li>Since rally on Monday and Tuesday was extreme, probably limited up side from here without more sideways to down.<li>Traders are looking to buy a pullback on the daily chart, which reduces chance of big bear day.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-8-2.png\" alt=\"\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is also unusual and climactic.<li>Yesterday was the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg up in a 10-day tight bull channel. The channel is therefore a parabolic wedge, which is a buy climax pattern.<li>A streak of bull days, a micro channel, and a parabolic wedge are buy climaxes, and they usually attract profit takers.<li>Normally, bulls would aggressively buy below low of prior day when there is a bull micro channel.<li>But the current buy climax is extreme. There is therefore an increased risk of a sharp reversal down at any time, like on September 3 or October 13.<li>Buy climaxes often last much longer than what might appear reasonable.

It therefore might open near the bottom of yesterday’s climactic rally into the close.<li>If so, there will be a Big Up and a Big Down. That creates Big Confusion, which typically results in a trading range. There is therefore an increased chance of a trading range open.<li>The bulls want today to close above the open, and for today’s low to stay above yesterday’s low. They hope that the streak of bull days and the micro channel continues. However, both have lasted an unusually long time. There is an increased chance that today will trade below yesterday’s low and close below today’s open.<li>Since the buy climax is so extreme, there is an increased chance of a big bear day today.<li>What is most likely after a buy climax? Exhausted bulls, minor profit taking, and a trading range.<li>Today is unlikely to be a big bull day because the buy climax is so extreme.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. This week’s low is probably too far below for the Emini to get there today. However, the bears might try to get the week to close below the midpoint of the week.

This is also unusual and climactic.<li>Yesterday was the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg up in a 10-day tight bull channel. The channel is therefore a parabolic wedge, which is a buy climax pattern.<li>A streak of bull days, a micro channel, and a parabolic wedge are buy climaxes, and they usually attract profit takers.<li>Normally, bulls would aggressively buy below low of prior day when there is a bull micro channel.<li>But the current buy climax is extreme. There is therefore an increased risk of a sharp reversal down at any time, like on September 3 or October 13.<li>Buy climaxes often last much longer than what might appear reasonable. Traders will continue to buy until there is a strong reversal down.<li>If series of strong trend bars up or down in 1<sup>st</sup>hour, increased chance of big trend day.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>The Emini is down 8 points in the Globex sessions. It therefore might open near the bottom of yesterday’s climactic rally into the close.<li>If so, there will be a Big Up and a Big Down. That creates Big Confusion, which typically results in a trading range. There is therefore an increased chance of a trading range open.<li>The bulls want today to close above the open, and for today’s low to stay above yesterday’s low. They hope that the streak of bull days and the micro channel continues. However, both have lasted an unusually long time. There is an increased chance that today will trade below yesterday’s low and close below today’s open.<li>Since the buy climax is so extreme, there is an increased chance of a big bear day today.<li>What is most likely after a buy climax? Exhausted bulls, minor profit taking, and a trading range.<li>Today is unlikely to be a big bull day because the buy climax is so extreme.<li>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. This week’s low is probably too far below for the Emini to get there today. However, the bears might try to get the week to close below the midpoint of the week. That would reduce the chance of higher prices next week.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-High-2-bottom-and-then-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-9.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 bottom and then weak bull channel.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EURUSD-Forex-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-9-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>Bear bar after 3 small legs up in tight bull channel, so parabolic wedge top.<li>Bears hope this is end of leg up in bear channel that began on January 6, and want breakout below March low.<li>7-day tight bull channel, so only 3- to 5-day pullback likely.<li>March low was wedge bottom, so 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up likely.<li>Yesterday traded below Wednesday’s low, and then above its high, and it was therefore an outside up day.<li>Today so far has not broken out of yesterday’s range, and is therefore an inside day after an outside day.<li>So far, there is now an ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern on the daily chart. If today remains an inside day, then this is a Breakout Mode pattern for Monday. Today would be both a buy signal bar, and a sell signal bar.<li>But if today remains a bear day with a close near its low, it will be a weak buy signal bar, especially after a parabolic wedge. That makes a pullback more likely than a continuation of the bull trend on Monday.</ul><h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Reversed down in Small Pullback Bear Trend from yesterday’s close.<li>Biggest overnight rally was less than 20 pips, so day traders have only been selling.<li>Near yesterday’s low and today is about the size of an average day, so selloff will probably evolve into a trading range soon.<li>Until there is at least a 20-pip bounce, day traders will only sell.<li>Once there is a 20-pip bounce, day traders will also begin to buy for scalps.<li>Bulls might be able to keep today from falling below yesterday’s low. Today would then remain an inside day, and there would be an ioi Breakout Mode pattern on the daily chart on Monday.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-double-bottom-then-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom then small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That streak lasted 15 days.<li>The 2011 streak reversed down 9% over the next few weeks, and the Emini had a 24% pullback in October 2011.<li>Whatever happens this time will not be the same, but the important point is that when a buy climax is extreme, the bulls soon take profits. Also, the profit taking often lasts longer, and the pullback can be deeper than what traders expect.<li>Another important point is that the current buy climax does not have to stop within the next few days. The Emini could form a brief pullback that could relieve some of the climax, and then the rally could resume for several more weeks. That is unlikely.<li>There is also a 13-bar bull micro channel (every low of the past 12 days was above the low of the prior day).<li>A lengthy micro channel means relentless, confident bulls.<li>They normally will eagerly buy below yesterday’s low once they get the chance.<li>However, because this rally is so extreme, the bulls might instead sell out of longs in a panic, and not buy below yesterday’s low.<li>Day traders are buying every intraday selloff, because each was followed by a new high. However, the streak on the daily chart is more extreme than any other in the past 10 years. There is therefore an increased risk of a sharp pullback coming at any time.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>The Emini is down 4 points in the Globex session.<li>Since extreme buy climax on daily chart, increased chance of big trend day up or down. The bulls might get a blow-off top, and the bears might get start of 2-week selloff.<li>Most days over past 6 days were mostly trading range days, but rallied at the end of the day. Day traders will continue to expect this until something else happens.<li>If series of strong trend bars up or down in 1st hour, then increased chance of strong trend day.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-High-2-Opening-Reversal-than-bull-micro-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-14.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 Opening Reversal than bull micro channel.

That streak lasted 15 days.<li>The 2011 streak reversed down 9% over the next few weeks, and the Emini had a 24% pullback in October 2011.<li>Whatever happens this time will not be the same, but the important point is that when a buy climax is extreme, the bulls soon take profits. Also, the profit taking often lasts longer, and the pullback can be deeper than what traders expect.<li>Another important point is that the current buy climax does not have to stop within the next few days. The Emini could form a brief pullback that could relieve some of the climax, and then the rally could resume for several more weeks. That is unlikely.<li>There is also a 13-bar bull micro channel (every low of the past 12 days was above the low of the prior day).<li>A lengthy micro channel means relentless, confident bulls.<li>They normally will eagerly buy below yesterday’s low once they get the chance.<li>However, because this rally is so extreme, the bulls might instead sell out of longs in a panic, and not buy below yesterday’s low.<li>Day traders are buying every intraday selloff, because each was followed by a new high. However, the streak on the daily chart is more extreme than any other in the past 10 years. There is therefore an increased risk of a sharp pullback coming at any time.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>The Emini is down 4 points in the Globex session.<li>Since extreme buy climax on daily chart, increased chance of big trend day up or down. The bulls might get a blow-off top, and the bears might get start of 2-week selloff.<li>Most days over past 6 days were mostly trading range days, but rallied at the end of the day. Day traders will continue to expect this until something else happens.<li>If series of strong trend bars up or down in 1st hour, then increased chance of strong trend day.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-High-2-Opening-Reversal-than-bull-micro-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-14.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 Opening Reversal than bull micro channel.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-rally-to-a-double-top-in-a-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-14-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>Strong rally from wedge bottom. Bulls want strong break above March 18 lower high, and then a test of the February 25 lower high.<li>Strong break above March 18 lower high, would convert 3-month bear trend into a big trading range, and not necessarily a bull trend.<li>3 legs up in tight bull channel is parabolic wedge, which usually will attract profit takers.<li>Wedge rally to double top in bear trend that began in January. Bears want reversal down, and break below March low, which is neckline of double top.<li>Probably will turn down soon for about a week, and form a higher low after the 2-month wedge bottom. Should then get 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up.<li>Trading range that began on March 9 will probably continue for at least another month.</ul><h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>ii on daily chart 2 days ago, is a possible Final Bull Flag. It is a magnet below. Usually a breakout above an ii Final Bull Flag reverses down within a few days, but might have to reach March 18 high first.<li>Bulls want big rally today to above March 18 high, but big bull day unlikely after ii 2 days ago, and mostly trading range trading for 6 days.<li>Broke above yesterday’s high, but mostly sideways in small range overnight.<li>Day traders are scalping up and down. Most of trading for 6 days has been within trading ranges.<li>March 18 high is a magnet above, but rally on daily chart is near enough for double top reversal down to begin at any time.<li>Big bear day unlikely since tight bull channel on daily chart.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-nested-head-and-shoulders-top-and-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini nested head and shoulders top and trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini then entered a trading range, which was also a triangle. It was a continuation of the range from the last hour of yesterday.<li>It broke below a lower high major. This was also a small head and shoulders top. Since it was the right shoulder of a bigger head and shoulders top, it was a nested pattern.<li>The big bear breakout reversed up from just above yesterday’s low. At that point, today was an Almost Outside Down Day.<li>The reversal failed and today became an outside down day.<li>Today closed back above yesterday’s low.<li>If tomorrow is also a big bear day, this will likely be the start of a 5- to 10% correction.<li>If not, there will probably soon be at least a small new high. However, the Emini will probably not get much above 4,200 before correcting at least 10%. April or May will likely be the high for several months, and possibly for the year.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

No top yet.<li>Since buy climax is most extreme in 10 years, profit taking likely to begin soon. Once there is profit taking after an extreme buy climax, it often lasts much longer than a typical pullback. Emini could enter trading range for many months.<li>Wednesday was 1<sup>st</sup>pullback in 13-day bull micro channel. Bulls eagerly bought 1<sup>st</sup>pullback in 13 days.<li>Entering a zone around 4,200 of several measured move targets, which often leads to profit taking.<li>As long as traders are buying every intraday selloff, bull trend on daily chart will continue.<li>Extreme buy climax Increases risk of big bear day at any time.<li>If series of strong trend bars up or down in 1<sup>st</sup>hour, increased chance of trend day.<li>Even though most days have had a least one swing up and one swing down, on most days, traders bought selloffs in 2<sup>nd</sup>half of day, and day rallied into the close.<li>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>The bulls want the week to close near its high, which would increase chance of higher prices next week.<li>Bears want week to close below open. That is unlikely because the week’s open is far below today’s likely close.<li>Alternatively, they want to week to close below the midpoint. That would increase the chance that next week would be sideways instead of up.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Up 9 points in the Globex session, so might get gap up to new all-time high.<li>Small gaps usually close before end of day, and usually in 1<sup>st</sup>hour.<li>For 4 weeks, bulls have bought every intraday selloff, expecting new high.<li>Most days had rally at end of day, which is common in bull trends.<li>Despite strong bull trend on daily chart, most days have also had a bear swing trade.<li>Very tight bull channel on 60-minute chart, and it has lasted more than 50 bars. This increases the chance of a reversal down at any time, and of an acceleration up to a possible blow-off top.<li>Day traders expect a lot of trading range trading, like over past 4 weeks.<li>If series of strong trend bars up or down, then increased chance of trend day.<li>Today is Friday, so increased chance of trend up or down in final hour.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-16.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then trading range.

Bulls need consecutive closes above that high, for traders to look for rally to continue up to next resistance at February 25 lower high.<li>More likely will soon begin a pullback for a week or two.<li>Rally from March low has been in a tight bull channel, and it has had 3 legs up. That is a parabolic wedge buy climax, which typically attracts profit takers.<li>Parabolic wedge rally to a double top (with March 18 high), so increased chance of a pullback to the bottom of the ii (consecutive inside bars) of Friday/Monday. An ii is often a final bull flag, which makes it a magnet.<li>Bears want resumption of 4-month bear trend from double top with March 18 high, but any selloff will more likely form higher low.<li>3-week rally has been strong enough, so that bulls will buy a pullback that retraces about half of the rally, and tests the March 9 low.<li>Whether or not bulls get successful breakout, EURUSD has been in a trading range since August. It should continue for at least a month, and probably several months.</ul><h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Early selloff to below yesterday’s low, and then 9-hour rally to above yesterday’s high. Today is therefore an outside up day.<li>Today’s range has been small, like yesterday’s.<li>Breakout above yesterday’s high was so far only by 1 pip above yesterday’s high. Also, only 5-pip breakout above March 18 high.<li>Range has been small, but trending up since reversal up from below yesterday’s low.<li>Day traders have been mostly buying, but taking quick profits (scalps).<li>Trading range for 5 hours, and day traders have been selling. However, biggest pullback has been only 20 pips. The bears are not yet making money on their shorts. Better to focus on buying until bears begin to make money.<li>Despite 9-hour rally, today’s range is small, and EURUSD in 25-pip range for 5 hours. Day traders have been scalping.<li>They will continue to scalp unless there is a series of strong bull bars breaking above the March 18 high. That is unlikely.<li>They will swing trade shorts if there is a series of big bear bars, which is also unlikely.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-parabolic-wedge-then-triangle-and-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge then triangle and trading range day.png\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There were two bear bars this week, which is a sign that bulls are starting to take some profits.<li>Once the buy climax ends, the Emini will have a difficult time going much above that high for the next several months, and possibly for the rest of the year.<li>Because the bull channel is tight, bulls will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down, even if it is 10%. They know even a strong reversal down has only a 30% chance of growing into a bear trend without first testing the high.<li>Once the trend tests the old high, then the bears have a 40% chance of a major reversal, like in the summer of 2011.</ul><h4 id=\"6-whos-buying-at-this-point\">Who’s buying at this point?</h4><ul><li>A trade can only take place if there is someone who thinks the market will go up and someone else thinks it will go down. There are currently far more bulls than bears, and the market has to go higher to find enough bears who are willing to sell.<li>Are traders buying now because they think the market is still cheap? No. Value bulls buy when the market sells off. They buy more when it sells off more. They are confident it will eventually rally, even if it takes a long time. They are patient and will not easily get scared out of their positions.<li>There are two types of traders who buy late in a buy climax: FOMO bulls and momentum traders.<li>A FOMO bull (Fear Of Missing Out) knows the risk is greater when buying in a buy climax, but he also knows the odds favor higher prices when the momentum is strong. He hopes that the market will be far above his entry price once there is a reversal, so that he will have little risk of losing money.<li>A momentum bull buys simply because the momentum up is strong. He knows he will probably make money by buying.<li>The FOMO bulls prefer to buy pullbacks, but ended up doing something that makes them uncomfortable.<li>Remember, the F stand for Fear, and fear is an unpleasant emotion. They bought at the top of a buy climax. Because they are uncomfortable, they will be quick to exit if there is a reversal, which would make them unbearably uncomfortable. They will then go back to their preferred style of trading, which is to buy pullbacks.<li>The momentum bulls are fast money traders, like scalpers on the 5-minute chart. They are looking for a profit within the next few days. If the market stalls, they will conclude that the momentum is no longer good. Since they bought because of good momentum, their reason to be long is no longer valid, and they get out.<li>Both types of buyers will be quick to get out if the rally stalls or starts to turn down. As traders sell out of longs, the market drops. As it does, more bulls will sell, and so will bears. The market will fall more, and faster, as a cascade of traders sell. This is why a buy climax often ends with a very fast and big reversal down.<li>It is also why there is an increased chance of a sharp reversal down within the next few weeks.</ul><h4 id=\"7-possible-blow-off-top\">Possible blow-off top</h4><ul><li>It is important to note that a buy climax also has an increased chance of accelerating up. That is a blow-off top.<li>There are weak bears betting on a reversal, and they are starting to scale into shorts. Most have to exit at some point because otherwise their risk would become unacceptably huge for many of them. If the market fails to turn down, those bears will start to buy back their shorts, often in a panic and at any price.<li>The FOMO bulls will buy even more aggressively as the market accelerates up because their fear of missing out increases.<li>The momentum bulls like strong momentum, and they too will buy more aggressively.<li>If there is a big acceleration up, many strong bulls will look at it as a great opportunity to take windfall profits.<li>Strong bears will also sell and scale in higher. They are never going to be scared out of their shorts.<li>That selling by strong bulls and bears can create a big reversal down, which can last a long time.<li>The strong bulls will wait patiently until they are confident that the selling has ended before they will buy again.<li>The strong bears expect at least a couple legs down and maybe a 10% correction, maybe 20%, so they too will not be quick to buy back their shorts.</ul><h2 id=\"8-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This should continue for at least a couple more months. As strong as the 3-week rally has been, as long as there are not a couple closes above the trading range, traders will continue to look for reversals every few weeks. While the 3-week rally make at least slightly higher prices likely next week, the EURUSD will probably soon go sideways to down for a couple weeks.<h2 id=\"1-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-eurusd-weekly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-strong-rally-but-within-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-24.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has strong rally but within trading range\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD Forex market has been in a trading range for 9 months. Within that range, there was a lower range from August through October, an upper range from November through February, a bear breakout in March, and a reversal up in April.<li>The April rally is in the middle of the 9-month range, but this week strongly broke back above January 1, which is the approximate bottom of the November to February range.<li>The bulls want the rally to continue up to above the top of that range (the January 6 high).<li>The 3 big bull bars closing on their highs make at least slightly higher prices likely next week.<li>This rally will probably stall in the November to February range, despite the 3 big bull bars closing on their highs.<li>However, the rally is strong enough to expect sideways to up trading, for at least a couple more weeks.<li>The bears hope that the 3-week rally is just a bull leg in the bear channel that began on January 6. They want a lower high, a break below the November 4 low at 1.16, and a measured move down to the March 2000 low at 1.06.<li>If the bears get a reversal within the next few weeks, there would be a lower high major trend reversal.

It was created by some profit taking, and therefore a pause in an Emini strong bull trend.<li>With this week closing near the high of the week, and making a new high on Friday, Monday might gap up. That would create a gap on the daily and weekly charts.<li>As climactic as the rally is, there is no sign of a top. Traders expect higher prices on Monday.<li>There is an important measured move target at 4244. The September 25/October 30 double bottom was a breakout test of the June 5 high. That high is therefore important. The pandemic low is important. Two important prices often create a 3<sup>rd</sup>important price, which is a measured move target.<li>Next week is the final week of the month. There is an increased chance of a big move up or down at the end of the week.<li>Traders often change the appearance of a bar just before it closes. The bar on the monthly chart closes on Friday.<li>The bears hope that the 5 bull bars will be an exhaustive buy climax, and a failed breakout above the 6-month tight bull channel. They want this to be the end of the bull trend, and the start of a retracement of half of the yearlong rally.<li>If next week begins a reversal down, the 1<sup>st</sup>target is the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the low of the 5 consecutive bull bars, which is at the 3,843.25 March 25 low.<li>5 consecutive big bull bars can be a blow-off top, and the end of a bull trend. But because they are coming within a tight bull channel (a Small Pullback Bull Trend) instead of from a breakout of a trading range (like a Final Bull Flag), the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down will probably be minor.<li>A minor reversal in a Small Pullback Bull Trend is typically 1- to 3-bars sideways to down. Sometimes the pullback can go sideways for 10 or more bars before the bulls buy again. That happened in September and October last year.<li>Again, after 5 weeks closing on their highs, traders expect at least slightly higher prices.</ul><h4 id=\"5-can-this-be-an-inverted-v-top\">Can this be an inverted V-top?</h4><ul><li>Can a reversal go straight down over the next few weeks to the March 25 low, or even to a 50% retracement of the yearlong rally, which is around the October 30 low at 3,200?<li>The high would be an inverted V-top, which is rare and therefore unlikely.<li>The 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down should be minor. A minor reversal only has a 30% chance of growing into a bear trend without first forming a major trend reversal.<li>Therefore, if this week or next week is the high for the year and the start of a bear trend, the bears will probably need a lower high major trend reversal before traders see the selloff as a bear trend.<li>To get a lower high major trend reversal, the bears will need a selloff of at least several weeks, and then a rally to a lower high over the course of at least several more weeks.<li>Since that process typically would require a couple months or more, the downside risk is small in May.<li>Traders expect about a 10% correction at some point this summer. The September and October selloffs last year were each about 10%.<li>Because this buy climax is so extreme, there is a 40% chance that the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down could reach 20%.<li>Most likely, the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down will only last 2 to 3 weeks. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get a reversal down to the March 25 low.<li>However, because the buy climax is so extreme, the selloff could lead to a trading range for a couple months, before the bull trend resumes.</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-double-top-at-top-of-bull-channel-in-strong-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has double top at top of bull channel in strong bull trend.png\"></a></figure><ul><li>In Emini strong bull trend but now sideways for 2 weeks.<li>The bulls see the tight trading range as a bull flag.

Back then, the Emini fell 9% over the following few weeks. There was then a minor new high, and that led to a 24% reversal down into October.<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-streak-of-15-bull-days-in-2011-1.png\" target=\"_blank\">I posted the chart last week.</a><li>I have said that this time will do something different.

I wrote about<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-13-consecutive-bull-days/#6-whos-buying-at-this-point\" target=\"_blank\">blow-off tops</a>last week.<li>While there might be a couple more brief new highs over the summer, the Emini will have a difficult time creating a sustained move far above the April high.<li>A buy climax usually leads to a trading range.<li>Once the bull trend evolves into a trading range, the bears have a 40% chance of a reversal down into a bear trend.</ul><h4 id=\"9-what-are-the-downside-targets\">What are the downside targets?</h4><ul><li>The Emini stalled for a week or more at all of the Big Round Numbers from 3,500 to 3,900.<li>It broke far above the biggest round number (4,000), without any hesitation, and it never pulled back to test it.<li>Once there is a reversal, the 4,000 Big Round Number is a strong magnet below.<li>There is also a gap on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts from when April 1<sup>st</sup>gapped above the March 31<sup>st</sup>high of 3,983.75, which was the high of March (and an all-time high).<li>On the daily chart, there is a big gap above the April 1 high of 4015.50, which is an important magnet.<li>The bottom of the streak of 13 consecutive bull bars is a magnet. That is the March 25 low of 3843.25.<li>Traders look to buy at 2%, 5%, 10% and 20% down from the high, so those are magnets below.</ul><h4 id=\"10-last-week-of-the-month\">Last week of the month</h4><ul><li>Next week is the final week of the month. Any time frame often has a surprisingly big move before a bar closes, which can alter the appearance of the bar. This month so far is a big bull bar closing near its high.<li>The bulls want April to close near its high. That would increase the chance of higher prices in May.<li>If April closes on the low, traders would expect lower prices in May. April has only a 20% chance of closing on the low of the month.<li>April will probably close near the high, or at least in the upper half of its range. The more it closes on its high, the more likely May will trade higher.<li>If April sells off next week and closes somewhere in the middle of its range, there would be confusion. That would reduce the chance of a big move up or down in May.<li>At the start of March, I wrote that March/April was the most bullish pair of consecutive months of the year.<li>Traders often say, “Sell in May and go away.” That is because a strong March and April increases the chance of a pullback into the 4<sup>th</sup>of July.<li>I do not trade calendar tendencies because the Trader’s Equation for calendar trades is weak.<li>However, with an extreme buy climax in March and April, there is less chance of a strong rally in May.

Emini at top of buy climax.<li>The reversal up from the low was also a test of the open of the week, and the 60-minute EMA.<li>The Emini yesterday closed in the upper 3<sup>rd</sup>of the range, and at a new all-time high, which is bullish, despite the early selloff.<li>Yesterday was the 4<sup>th</sup>consecutive bear day, which is a sign that more bulls are starting to take profits.<li>The Emini should correct 10% this summer, and this might be the start.<li>However, until there is a clear, strong reversal down on the daily chart, the odds continue to favor at least slightly higher prices.<li>Picking tops in a strong bull trend is a losing approach, unless a trader can trade small, use wide stops, and scale in.<li>There still could be a couple more pullbacks and new highs, before the correction begins, but there probably is not much left to the current rally before there is a 10% pullback.<li>Since the buy climax is so extreme, there is a 40% chance that the correction will reach 20%.<li>The correction could last a couple months. Therefore, the Emini will probably soon transition into a trading range for the summer.<li>Today is the last day of the week, and of the month. The bulls want April to close on its high, and they want the week to close above the open.<li>If April closes within 10 points of the high, the Emini might gap up on Monday. There would then be a gap on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<li>If today closes below the open of the week, this week would be a minor sell signal bar on the weekly chart.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Down 20 points in the Globex session.

Then, traders will decide if this week will finally have a bear body.<li>Big Down, Big Up yesterday creates Big Confusion, which increases the chance of a trading range day today. Today might oscillate around the open of the week.<li>Bears hope that yesterday’s reversal up was simply a test of the early high of the day. They want a reversal back down today. The late reversal up would then be a double top on the high just after yesterday’s open.<li>Small chance of huge bear trend day. Yesterday’s low is the neckline of yesterday’s double top. The bears want a strong break below yesterday’s low, and then a 40-point measured move down, based on height of yesterday’s double top.<li>Most days for several weeks have had at least one swing up and one swing down.

Yesterday could be the start of a 2-week pullback.<li>The bulls want the tight bull channel to continue to above the February 25 high, and then the January high.<li>The EURUSD has been in a trading range for 9 months. Trading ranges resist change.<li>This rally is therefore more likely a bull leg in that trading range, than a resumption of last year’s bull trend.<li>If so, the rally should soon stall, and the EURUSD should go sideways to down for a couple weeks.<li>Yesterday had a bear body but a big tail. It is a weak sell signal bar, especially since it is coming in a tight bull channel.<li>The EURUSD might have to go sideways for a few days before it can go down.<li>Today is the final day of April.<li>April totally reversed the March selloff on the monthly chart, and it broke slightly above the March high.<li>The bulls want April to close above the March high, which would slightly increase the chance of higher prices next week.<li>The overnight selloff make it more likely that April will close below the March high. That would increase the chance of May being sideways to down.</ul><h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>By breaking below yesterday’s low overnight, the EURUSD triggered a sell signal for consecutive wedge tops.<li>Bulls are taking profits on the daily chart, and others are shorting, betting on a couple legs down over the next 2 weeks.<li>Bulls want today to close back above yesterday’s low. Today would then be a weak entry bar on the daily chart, and the bulls might then continue their Small Pullback Bull Trend.<li>Bears want today to close near the low of the day. That would increase the chance that the Small Pullback Bull Trend on the daily chart has ended, and a 2-week reversal down has begun.<li>The overnight selloff has been in a tight bear channel. Day traders have only been selling.<li>If the bears begin to take profits and the overnight bear trend evolves into a trading range, day traders will also begin to buy for scalps.<li>Most likely the overnight strong bear trend will transition into a weaker bear trend and possibly a trading range. But unless there is at least a 20-pip bounce, day traders will only sell.<li>If today transitions into a trading range, day traders will begin to buy for scalps.<li>There is a 20% chance that today will form a major trend reversal on the 5-minute chart, and it will close back up near the high.<li>At a minimum, the bulls will try to get today to close above yesterday’s low. That would increase the chance of the Emini going sideways, instead of down early next week.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-4-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Gap down and then sold off from a double top at the EMA.<li>1<sup>st</sup>reversal up from below open of week was minor.<li>Then got higher low major trend reversal, but in triangle.<li>Today was a trading range day.<li>On the 5-minute chart, the Emini closed just above the open of the day.<li>The CME owns the Emini and it uses an algorithm to calculate the close on the daily and weekly charts. It is often different from that on the 5-minute chart. On the daily chart, the close was below the open of the day and the open of the week.<li>This week therefore is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<li>Because the weekly bull channel is tight, this is a minor sell signal. However, the extreme buy climax will probably soon lead to a 10% correction and possible a 2-month trading range.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
