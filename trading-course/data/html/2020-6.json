It closed above 3044.25 and therefore the Emini is no longer in correction territory (10% down from the high).<p>Today might trigger the buy signal. But, there is not much left to this rally. There should be sellers around the March 3 high. The odds favor at least slightly higher prices before a reversal down.<p>But the sell zone is 3,000 to 3,150. The Emini is already in that zone. It is therefore reasonable for bears to begin to short with a stop at a new all-time high.<p>April was a strong High 1 buy signal bar on the monthly chart. May triggered the buy and was a strong entry bar. But February and March formed a Surprise Bear Breakout. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down this summer.<p>While June will probably go above the May high, the March 3 lower high is major resistance on the daily chart. Traders expect the rally to stall and then reverse in June.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 6 points in the Globex range. It has stayed above Friday’s low and below Friday’s high. Today so far is an inside day.<p>Most days over the past month have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Day traders will expect trends to reverse after 2 – 3 hours again today.<p>Friday reversed up strongly late in the day. It then went sideways and had a final leg up. That trading range is reasonable candidate for a Final Bull Flag. Today might open back in that flag. If so, that would increase the chance of a trading range open.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-1.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

The rally has 3 legs and it therefore a wedge. A wedge rally to a double top typically begins to pull back.<p>Last week broke above a head and shoulders bottom. Traders expect a pullback to the neckline. This week will probably be the start of that pullback.<p>Less likely, there will be big bull trend bars on the daily chart today or tomorrow. If that were to happen, the rally would then continue up to the March high.<p>The bears want more than a pullback. They want a reversal down from a double top. Then, they want a break below the April 24 low. That is the neckline of the double top. A measured move down from there would be around par (1.0).<p>But without a strong reversal down this week, a pullback and a 2nd attempt to break above the March 27 high is more likely<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above the March 27 high overnight. The bulls who bought that close had no chance to exit without a loss. Today is their chance.<p>The reversal down indicates that many bulls sold. Some of those bulls bought the near around the shoulders bottom and are taking profits.<p>With quiet overnight trading, a big trend up or down is not likely today. However, the open of the day is important. If the bears can get the day to close below the open, traders will see today as a sell signal bar at resistance on the daily chart. That will increase the chance of lower prices this week.<p>The bulls not only want today to close above the open, they want it to close above the March 27 high. That would increase the chance of higher prices this week.<p>Since the overnight range is small and there have been reversals, day traders have been scalping. Some bears are shorting for a swing down to below the May 21 high.<p>The day will probably continue as a quiet day. But because of the wedge rally to a double top, the bears will probably get a close below the open and then a pullback this week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That triggered a High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. After consecutive strong months on the monthly chart, the Emini will probably test above the May high in early June. It is currently a few points above the June high in the Globex session.<p>The most important target is the March 3 lower high. That was the start of the parabolic wedge sell climax. The beginning of a sell climax is always a magnet once there is a reversal up.<p>I mentioned that the bears will look to sell above the 200 day moving average up to around the March 3 high. Therefore the sell zone is roughly between 3,000 and 3,150. Many traders are waiting for the rally to reach the March 3 high of 3125.75 to start to sell.<p>Traders think there will be a 50% pullback from the 2 month rally before there is a new all-time high. The Emini will probably trade up at least a little more before the bears will sell.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 15 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above yesterday’s high. It might even gap above the June high. It should get above the June high this week.<p>Even though the rally is climactic, there is no top yet. Furthermore, there is room to the March 3 high above. That is resistance and therefore a magnet. Traders expect higher prices.<p>Yesterday’s rally was a 2nd leg up from Friday’s dramatic late rally. A rally today would be a 3rd leg up. That would increase the chance of a selloff lasting a few hours on the 5 minute chart. It could last a day or two. However, when there is a bull trend on the daily chart and a magnet above, day traders are more interested in buying pullbacks than selling rallies.<p>Yesterday’s rally was extreme and therefore climactic. That increases the chance of more trading range price action today. Also, the 2 hour trading range late in the day is a possible Final Bull Flag. That increase the chance that if there is a gap up today, there will be a selloff at some point to close the gap.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is usually a pullback to the neckline. That is the May 1 high.<p>The past 3 days have smaller bodies and prominent tails. That is a sign of hesitation. It increases the chance of a pullback soon.<p>The bulls would like consecutive closes above the March 27 high. Traders would then start to think that the rally will continue up to the March high without more than a 3 day pullback.<p>There is a wedge rally to a double top with the March 27 high. That is a common reversal setup. But, there is no sell signal yet.<p>The bears want a trend reversal down and not just a 3 – 5 day pullback. They will probably need at least a micro double top. Currently, the odds are that the bulls will buy a pullback to the May 1 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to above yesterday’s high overnight. It then entered a tight trading range just above that high.<p>This is the 3rd consecutive days where there has been hesitation at the high. Traders are becoming less willing to buy at the high. That increases the chance that the EURUSD will have to pull back to find more buyers. It also will encourage bears to begin to short for a minor reversal down.<p>Daytraders have been mostly buying for 6 days, but they have begun to sell for scalps. Also, they are starting to wait to buy pullbacks instead of buying at the market. Additionally, they are starting to take profits around the most recent high. This increases the chance of a pullback this week.<p>But, it is still easier to make money as a bull. This will be true until the bears are able to get more than a 30 pip reversal down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-trading-range-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up from a parabolic wedge sell climax and rallied back above the May high. There was a Buy The Close rally at the end of the day and the day closed on its high.<p>On the daily chart, the bull channel is tight and the March 3 high is an important magnet above.

It is currently a few points above the June high in the Globex session.<p>The most important target is the March 3 lower high. That was the start of the parabolic wedge sell climax. The beginning of a sell climax is always a magnet once there is a reversal up.<p>I mentioned that the bears will look to sell above the 200 day moving average up to around the March 3 high. Therefore the sell zone is roughly between 3,000 and 3,150. Many traders are waiting for the rally to reach the March 3 high of 3125.75 to start to sell.<p>Traders think there will be a 50% pullback from the 2 month rally before there is a new all-time high. The Emini will probably trade up at least a little more before the bears will sell.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 15 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above yesterday’s high. It might even gap above the June high. It should get above the June high this week.<p>Even though the rally is climactic, there is no top yet. Furthermore, there is room to the March 3 high above. That is resistance and therefore a magnet. Traders expect higher prices.<p>Yesterday’s rally was a 2nd leg up from Friday’s dramatic late rally. A rally today would be a 3rd leg up. That would increase the chance of a selloff lasting a few hours on the 5 minute chart. It could last a day or two. However, when there is a bull trend on the daily chart and a magnet above, day traders are more interested in buying pullbacks than selling rallies.<p>Yesterday’s rally was extreme and therefore climactic. That increases the chance of more trading range price action today. Also, the 2 hour trading range late in the day is a possible Final Bull Flag. That increase the chance that if there is a gap up today, there will be a selloff at some point to close the gap.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-from-head-and-shoulders-bottom-but-wedge-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-2-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex breakout from head and shoulders bottom but wedge rally\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is rallying up from a head and shoulders bottom. There is usually a pullback to the neckline. That is the May 1 high.<p>The past 3 days have smaller bodies and prominent tails. That is a sign of hesitation. It increases the chance of a pullback soon.<p>The bulls would like consecutive closes above the March 27 high. Traders would then start to think that the rally will continue up to the March high without more than a 3 day pullback.<p>There is a wedge rally to a double top with the March 27 high. That is a common reversal setup. But, there is no sell signal yet.<p>The bears want a trend reversal down and not just a 3 – 5 day pullback. They will probably need at least a micro double top. Currently, the odds are that the bulls will buy a pullback to the May 1 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to above yesterday’s high overnight. It then entered a tight trading range just above that high.<p>This is the 3rd consecutive days where there has been hesitation at the high. Traders are becoming less willing to buy at the high. That increases the chance that the EURUSD will have to pull back to find more buyers. It also will encourage bears to begin to short for a minor reversal down.<p>Daytraders have been mostly buying for 6 days, but they have begun to sell for scalps. Also, they are starting to wait to buy pullbacks instead of buying at the market. Additionally, they are starting to take profits around the most recent high. This increases the chance of a pullback this week.<p>But, it is still easier to make money as a bull. This will be true until the bears are able to get more than a 30 pip reversal down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-trading-range-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up from a parabolic wedge sell climax and rallied back above the May high. There was a Buy The Close rally at the end of the day and the day closed on its high.<p>On the daily chart, the bull channel is tight and the March 3 high is an important magnet above. Odd favor higher prices, even if there is a 1 – 3 day pullback first.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders expect the rally to continue up to the March 3 high of 3125.75. At that point, the bears will sell, looking for a 15% correction. The bulls will continue to buy, hoping for a new high of the year. Currently, the bear case is stronger. The Emini will probably begin to pullback for a month or more once it gets to 3,100 – 3,150.<p>Since the rally has been strong and there is room to the target, the Emini should work higher. There can be a 1 – 3 day pullback at any time. However the bulls have bought every brief pullback for 2 months. They will continue to buy them until the Emini reaches the target.<p>The Emini has been getting vacuumed up there over the past 3 days. The bears do not want to sell yet because they are confident that the rally will reach the March 3 high. Why sell below when you believe you can sell higher?<p>Also, the bulls are increasingly confident that the rally will soon get there. Consequently, they are buying every intraday selloff, confident that they will make money.<p>This lack of selling and the aggressive buying creates a vacuum up to important resistance. The Emini is currently in a buy vacuum, which is an acceleration up late in a bull trend and a type of buy climax.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 18 points in the Globex session. It is testing the 3,100 Big Round Number. Will it reach the March 3 high of 3125.75 today? It’s possible.<p>It will open far above the 20 bar EMA on the 5 minute chart. Traders do not like to buy far above the average price unless the early bars are far above average. For example, if the 1st 2 bars are big bull bars closing near their highs, day traders will be more willing to buy at the high.<p>But 80% of the time when there is a big gap up, there is some early trading range trading within the first hour or two. The bulls want to buy closer to the EMA. They look for a double bottom or a wedge bottom there.<p>The bears want to sell a rally to a wedge top or a double top. It typically takes an hour or two for these patterns to form. There is only a 20% chance of a strong trend up or down from the 1st bar.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-trading-range-with-late-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-3.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with late bull breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That trading range was also a head and shoulders bottom. Traders expect a pullback to the neckline soon. That is the May 1 high at around 1.10.<p>The past 4 candlesticks on the daily chart days have prominent tails on top. That is a sign of minor selling. It is a micro wedge, which is a wedge on a smaller time frame. It is an early sign that the bulls are getting exhausted.<p>There are also 3 legs up from the May low. That is a wedge, and now the 3rd leg up contains a micro wedge. A nested pattern is more likely to result in a minor reversal. Traders expect a pullback to 1.10 to begin within a few days.<p>But the 3 week rally is strong. Consequently, if there a reversal next week, it will probably be minor. Traders will look to buy around 1.10 and the 20 day EMA.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied early in overnight trading and then pulled back. Traders are becoming less interested in buying at the high and now are wanting to buy pullbacks. This is an early sign of a market transitioning from a strong trend into a trading range.<p>The bears are now more willing to sell. For 6 days, its been much easier for day traders to make money by focusing on buying. They now are also looking to sell reversals down from the high.<p>For the past few days, day traders have been mostly scalping for 10 – 20 pips. That is what they have been doing overnight. They will likely continue throughout the day.<p>Because there is a nested wedge on the daily chart, day traders know there is a reduced chance of a big rally from here. Also, there is an increased chance of one or more bear trend days within the next week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-and-test-of-March-3-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption and test of March 3 high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini might go sideways here for several days before traders decide on a reversal down or a continuation up to the all-time high.<p>The odds are still against a new all-time high before there is a 15% pullback. Consecutive closes above the March 3 high will shift the probability in favor of the bulls.<p>The Emini is now a price level where many bulls will take profits and many bears will begin to sell. There is no top yet and there is a magnet just above. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices. But if there is enough selling around here, the Emini could retrace half of the 3 month rally.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Late in the day, it broke above the March 3 high. However, it sold off into the close. That was the start of the March crash and it is therefore an important target. Many bulls will take profits there and the bears will begin to sell for a trade down.<p>The Emini might trade around it for several days as traders decide if the rally will continue up to a new high or begin a 15% correction this summer. If the bulls get consecutive closes above that high, the Emini will probably make a new high this summer. Without that, the rally should exhaust itself and traders will expect the Emini to retrace about half of the 3 month rally.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 16 points in the Globex session. It may open around yesterday’s low. That is interesting because yesterday was a big bull day on the daily chart and it came late in a bull trend. If the next day opens near the low of that day and sells off, it often leads to a reversal down. Consequently, if today opens near yesterday’s low, there is an increased chance that today will be a bear trend day closing near its low.<p>Can today be another big bull trend day? Probably not. This is the price where the bears have wanted to sell since the reversal up from the March low. The bulls will probably be unable to break strongly above it.<p>If they do, it will likely take several days to use up all of the supply here. Therefore, day traders will expect to sell rallies above the March 3 high. But they know that the Emini will should go sideways here for a few days. They will therefore look to buy selloffs. Finally, they know there is an increased chance of a bear trend day and the start of a reversal down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-and-test-of-March-3-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-4.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption and test of March 3 high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-exhaustive-buy-climax-near-measured-move-target.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-4-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex exhaustive buy climax near measured move target\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied strongly and it is near a measured move target. Yesterday’s body was bigger. When a bar is big and it comes late in a bull trend, it is usually a sign of exhaustion. There is often one more brief leg up for a couple bars, but there is then typically a pullback.<p>The 1st target is the bottom of that buy climax bar. At a minimum, that is around the March 27 high. More likely, the pullback will test the May 1 high. Another target is the neckline of the head and shoulders bottom. That is the May high, just above 1.10.<p>The bulls want this rally to go straight up to the March high without more than a 1 – 3 bar pullback. That would be unusual, especially after a buy climax day like yesterday. Traders should expect profit taking within the next days.<p>If today closes near the open, today will make other bulls take some profits. Also, bears will begin to scale into shorts.<p>But if today closes near its high, the EURUSD should reach the 1.1309 measured move target within a few days before pulling back. In either case, traders should expect a 100 – 200 pip pullback to begin within a week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight and then reversed up to a new high, Over the past 30 minutes, it has pulled back to the open.<p>Today so far is a doji bar on the daily chart. Since yesterday was a big bar in a buy climax, it will attract profit takers. The selloff on today’s open and again on the rally to the new high are examples.<p>Will there be enough sellers today near the high of the day to cause the day to close near the open? That will attract other profit takers tomorrow.<p>Or, will the bulls buy every selloff and get the day to close near its high? The big reversals today are a sign that the bull trend on the daily chart is losing momentum. Day traders will be more willing to sell rallies. They will continue to buy selloffs.<p>Strong bull trends usually do not immediately reverse into bear trends. Therefore today will probably be sideways.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-High-2-bottom-then-wedge-rally-to-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 bottom then wedge rally to double top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But it closed back near the open and formed a doji candlestick.<p>It is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the daily chart. While a doji is a weak buy signal, the bull trend is exceptionally strong. The bulls have been buying for any reason, and a weak buy signal bar is good enough in a strong bull trend.<p>The bulls want a new all-time high. The next target above the March 3 high is the close of 2019, which is 3,219.75. The bulls want the Emini to get there. If it does, the Emini will be up on the year, despite a 35% selloff in March.<p>The Emini could go a little above the March high over the next few weeks, but it probably will not continue up to a new all-time high. It might go sideways around it for several more days before either breaking above or reversing down.<p>There will probably be about a 50% retracement of the 3 month rally at some point this year. That would be about a 15% selloff. Traders expect that the top is around where we currently are, but the Emini could go sideways or up a little more for several weeks before reversing down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 43 points in the Globex session. It will probably open with a big gap up today. This is a breakout above the March 3 lower high.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the average price. The bulls do not want to pay far above average unless the bars are far above average.<p>If the bulls get a couple bull bars closing on their highs on the open, today could be a Bull Trend From The Open day. More often, the bulls are hesitant to pay too much above the average price.<p>The Emini usually enters a trading range for the 1st hour or two. Once it gets closer to the 20 bar EMA, the bulls will look to buy either a wedge bull flag or a double bottom.<p>The bears know that the bulls prefer to buy near the average price. They therefore look for either a wedge rally or double top in the 1st 2 hours for a possible early high of the day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-High-2-bottom-then-wedge-rally-to-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-5.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The rally is unsustainable and therefore climactic. The stop for the bulls is now far below. To reduce risk, many bulls will reduce their position size. This profit taking will cause a pullback soon.<p>It is important to note that the past 2 bars were the biggest consecutive bull bars of the rally. That typically will attract profit taking. It is an attempt to break above a tight bull channel. This is therefore a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>There often is a pause bar and then a brief additional leg up before there is profit taking. However, traders should expect profit taking to begin within the next few days.<p>When there is profit taking in a buy climax, the 1st target is the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the low of the 2 big bull bars, just below 1.1200.<p>The pullback typically has at least a couple small legs down. At that point, the bulls will decide if they should buy again or wait for more of a pullback. Bears will begin to sell for a trade down, betting that the bulls will take some profits.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied again in the overnight session but sold off from above yesterday/s high. The bulls are probably using rallies to take some profits.<p>It has been much easier for day traders to make money as a bull for 3 weeks. But if the bears can get today to close below the open, there will finally be a bear body on the daily chart. That will make more bulls look to take some profits. Additionally, the bears will be more willing to sell. Day traders will be more willing to sell rallies in addition to buying pullbacks.<p>Today’s close is important. If the bears can get today to close below the open, traders will begin to expect a pullback to begin within the next few days. If today closes on its low, it would be a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a minor reversal down to Wednesday’s low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-trading-range-open-and-then-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range open and then parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But it closed back near the open and formed a doji candlestick.<p>It is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the daily chart. While a doji is a weak buy signal, the bull trend is exceptionally strong. The bulls have been buying for any reason, and a weak buy signal bar is good enough in a strong bull trend.<p>The bulls want a new all-time high. The next target above the March 3 high is the close of 2019, which is 3,219.75. The bulls want the Emini to get there. If it does, the Emini will be up on the year, despite a 35% selloff in March.<p>The Emini could go a little above the March high over the next few weeks, but it probably will not continue up to a new all-time high. It might go sideways around it for several more days before either breaking above or reversing down.<p>There will probably be about a 50% retracement of the 3 month rally at some point this year. That would be about a 15% selloff. Traders expect that the top is around where we currently are, but the Emini could go sideways or up a little more for several weeks before reversing down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 43 points in the Globex session. It will probably open with a big gap up today. This is a breakout above the March 3 lower high.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the average price. The bulls do not want to pay far above average unless the bars are far above average.<p>If the bulls get a couple bull bars closing on their highs on the open, today could be a Bull Trend From The Open day. More often, the bulls are hesitant to pay too much above the average price.<p>The Emini usually enters a trading range for the 1st hour or two. Once it gets closer to the 20 bar EMA, the bulls will look to buy either a wedge bull flag or a double bottom.<p>The bears know that the bulls prefer to buy near the average price. They therefore look for either a wedge rally or double top in the 1st 2 hours for a possible early high of the day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-High-2-bottom-then-wedge-rally-to-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-5.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-5-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has rallied strongly for 3 weeks. The rally is unsustainable and therefore climactic. The stop for the bulls is now far below. To reduce risk, many bulls will reduce their position size. This profit taking will cause a pullback soon.<p>It is important to note that the past 2 bars were the biggest consecutive bull bars of the rally. That typically will attract profit taking. It is an attempt to break above a tight bull channel. This is therefore a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>There often is a pause bar and then a brief additional leg up before there is profit taking. However, traders should expect profit taking to begin within the next few days.<p>When there is profit taking in a buy climax, the 1st target is the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the low of the 2 big bull bars, just below 1.1200.<p>The pullback typically has at least a couple small legs down. At that point, the bulls will decide if they should buy again or wait for more of a pullback. Bears will begin to sell for a trade down, betting that the bulls will take some profits.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied again in the overnight session but sold off from above yesterday/s high. The bulls are probably using rallies to take some profits.<p>It has been much easier for day traders to make money as a bull for 3 weeks. But if the bears can get today to close below the open, there will finally be a bear body on the daily chart. That will make more bulls look to take some profits. Additionally, the bears will be more willing to sell. Day traders will be more willing to sell rallies in addition to buying pullbacks.<p>Today’s close is important. If the bears can get today to close below the open, traders will begin to expect a pullback to begin within the next few days. If today closes on its low, it would be a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a minor reversal down to Wednesday’s low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-trading-range-open-and-then-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range open and then parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The breakout above the March 3 high is big enough for traders to look at the next resistance. That is the close of 2019 and the gap above the February 24 high.<p>Traders expect at least slightly higher prices. Because today was extremely climactic, there might be a pullback for a day or two next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There is no top yet. Traders will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>broke below the ii pattern on the monthly chart. Traders expect sideways to down trading for many months.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market rallied strongly for 3 weeks. However, the daily chart has an exhaustive buy climax. Traders expect a pullback for a few days next week.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures weekly chart:</strong><br>Reversing down below an ii on the monthly chart after an extreme buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-bear-breakout-below-ii-pattern-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-6.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart bear breakout below ii pattern buy climax.png\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures had the most extreme buy climax in history during the 1st 3 months of this year. After a climactic reversal down in March, there were consecutive inside bars in April and May.<p>That is a Breakout Mode pattern. June triggered a sell signal by falling below the May low. June is currently a bear bar closing near its low. But this is only 1 week into the month. It could look very different once the month ends.<p>Even if the bear breakout reverses up, traders do not expect the bond futures to rally to much above the March buy climax high. In fact, most traders think that March will be the high for the next many years.<h3>A bull trend usually transition into trading ranges before becoming a bear trend</h3><p>A reversal down from a buy climax does not necessarily mean that the bull trend will become a bear trend. Even when it does, it typically has to pass through a trading range phase for at least 10 to 20 bars. Since this is a monthly chart, the trading range could last a couple years or more.<p>A trading range has both bear and bull legs. However, the bottom of the range might be lower than what seems reasonable. Therefore, if this week is the start of a bear leg, it could fall farther and last longer that what traders expect.<h3>How far can a reversal down fall?</h3><p>When there is a reversal down from a buy climax, the 1st target for the bears is the breakout point. That is the August 2019 high of 163 14/32.<p>Next, traders will look for a test of the 20 month EMA and the bottom of the most recent strong rally. That is the January low and it is more than 20 points below this week’s low.<p>Finally, the bond market was in a trading range from 2015 through 2018. The bottom of that range is around 125. Since traders thought that was a fair price for a long time, once the market gets there in a few years, traders expect it to go sideways there again for a couple years.<h3>What will the price action look like?</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-bear-breakout-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-6-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart bear breakout after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>It is unlikely that this week’s reversal down on the weekly chart will be the start of a selloff that was as strong as the January to March rally. Traders do not expect the selloff to collapse in a series of big bear bars closing on their lows. More likely, there will be pullbacks along the way.<p>The bond market will probably be in a trading range for several years. Therefore, any trend down over the next year or two will end up as a leg in a trading range.<p>Legs in trading ranges typically have lots of trading range price action. There will probably not be a series of 4 or more big bear bars closing on their lows. That would be trending price action.<p>Furthermore, many bars will have prominent tails. That represents hesitation. Also, the market will have several places were it goes sideways for several bars.<h3>Disappointment and confusion are hallmarks of a trading range</h3><p>In a trading range, strong trend bars will typically not have good follow-through. For example, the bar after a big bear bar will probably not be another big bear bar closing near its low. Instead, a big bear bar will often lead to a bull bar. That is disappointing for the bears who want a trend.<p>Since the bond market will probably be in a trading range for several years, traders should expect trading range price action. Bad follow-through and bad buy and sell signal bars will disappoint traders. Repeated reversals will confuse them.<p>Disappointment and confusion are the hallmarks of trading ranges. If the current selloff begins to disappoint the bears within a few weeks and confuse both the bulls and bears, traders will conclude that the market is in a trading range. They will look for reversals, buy low, sell high, and take quick profits.<h3>What to expect next week</h3><p>The selloff is probably within what will be a trading range for the next few years. Consequently, traders expect disappointment. That reduces the chance of a strong follow-through bear bar next week.<p>Instead, traders expect anything else. For example, instead of a big bear bar closing on its low, there might be a big tail below. Or, next week could be a doji bar or even a bull bar.<p>If next week is a big bear bar closing on its low, there would be consecutive strong bear bars. That would increase the chance of a 3rd or 4th consecutive big bear bar.<p>But that is trending price action. Consequently, it is more likely that next week or the week after will disappoint the bears.<p>However, 2 consecutive closes below the 2 month tight trading range will increase the chance of lower prices over the next several weeks.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex weekly chart:</strong><br>Extreme buy climax on the daily chart should attract profit takers next week</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-bear-breakout-above-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-6-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart bear breakout above triangle\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart had a 2nd consecutive big bull trend bar this week. This is a reversal up from a higher low major trend reversal. The bars are surprisingly strong. A Bull Surprise typically has at least a small 2nd leg up. Consequently, the bulls will buy the 1st 1 to 2 week pullback.<h3>Monthly chart triggered an ioi buy signal in May</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-ioi-candlestick-chart-pattern.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-6-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly ioi candlestick chart pattern\"></a></figure><p>The monthly chart triggered a buy signal in May when May went above the April high. April was an inside bar after a big outside bar. An ioi (inside-outside-inside) pattern is a Breakout Mode setup. There is now a 2 month bull breakout.<p>The monthly chart is rallying from a higher low compared to the January 2017 low. Traders see the 2 year bear channel as a bull flag. The past 2 months are testing the bear trendline at the top of that bull flag.<p>If the bulls can get a monthly close above the March high, they will expect the rally to continue up to the September 2018 high. That was the start of the bear channel. That is always a target when there is a reversal up from a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. The bear spike was the April and May selloff in 2018.<h3>Buy climax on the daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-at-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-6-4.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart has parabolic wedge buy climax at bear trend line\"></a></figure><p>The rally on the daily chart has been exceptionally strong. After breaking above the neckline of a head and shoulders bottom, the EURUSD rallied to above the measured move target.<p>However, Thursday’s range was particularly big. Also, Wednesday was a fairly big bull day as well. When there is a surge like this late in a bull trend, it tends to attract profit takers. There is a 60% chance that the EURUSD will begin to pull back next week or after one more brief leg up.<h3>Traders expect a pullback to test the breakout point</h3><p>This is a strong break above this neck line of a head and shoulders bottom. Traders usually expect a pullback to the neckline of the bottom. However, that is the May 1 high and it might be too far below. The bulls might buy aggressively before a pullback reaches that breakout point.<p>A common target for a selloff after a buy climax is the bottom of the most recent climactic rally. That is Wednesday’s low. It is near the March 27 high, which is another breakout point. Traders should expect a pullback to begin next week.<p>It is important to note that the 3 week rally was exceptionally strong. When that is the case, traders expect a 2nd leg up. Therefore, traders will buy a pullback to around Wednesday’s low, the March 27 high, and the 20 day EMA. The bears will need at least a micro double top before traders can get more than a 1 week pullback.<h2>Pandemic Update</h2><p>There is not much to add to<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/special-report/coronavirus-pandemic-biggest-worldwide-event-lifetimes/\" target=\"_blank\">last week’s special update</a>. However, there was a particularly interesting report in<em>The Lancet</em>this week. It looked at people exposed to patients with Covid-19 in several settings, including medical centers and in homes. The researchers found a dramatic benefit from using face masks, social distancing, and eye protection.<p>I am surprised this report is not getting more coverage. Many people around the world are not using face masks or social distancing because they suspect it is nonsense. This study shows that being careful can reduce the risk of infection by as much as 88%. I think the public needs to know this because many people would start being more careful. This would reduce the number of infections and deaths while we wait for a vaccine.<p>The Lancet is one of the world’s premier medical and scientific journals. It is for scientists and not the lay public. Consequently, some of the articles use so much jargon that they can be very difficult to understand.<h3>Lancet article on the math behind face masks and social distancing</h3><p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">The article that caught my attention was a statistical analysis of 172 other studies</a>. The studies were done on 6 continents and involved 25,000 patients. None of the studies was randomized. They were all observational, which makes them less reliable.<p>However, the analysis found several statistically significant results. The math is boring and beyond what we need. Here is my summary of the research.<p>If someone is exposed to a person with Covid-19, he reduces his risk of infection by 83% if he wears a face mask. His risk of getting infected if he wears a mask is 3.1% compared to 17.4% without a mask. That is an 83% reduction of risk. The risk is even less with a N95 mask. But since the infection is mostly spread through big droplets, even a disposable mask is very helpful.<p>What if he stays 2 meters (about 6 feet) away from the contagious person? His risk of infection only 1.5% compared to 13% for people getting within 1 meter of the patient. That is a 88% reduction in risk. If he stays 3 meters away (10 feet) instead of 2 meters, the risk is reduced by another 50%.<p>Finally, they looked at people who wear eye protection, like eye glasses, googles, or face shields. Their risk of infection is 6% compared to 16% for people without. That is a 62% reduction. This is less dramatic than for face masks because most infections come through your mouth and nose.<h3>The study helps explain the rally</h3><p>If you think about it, this study provides an explanation for the dramatic reversal up from the March crash. The market sold off strongly because of New York hospitals getting overwhelmed. Everyone was afraid this experience would spread across the country and be incredibly devastating to the economy.<p>Once people started to be careful, the curve flattened. The rate of new cases stayed below the capacity of the hospitals to handle coronavirus patients. This prevented the New York disaster from spreading across the country. The market quickly sensed this and rallied strongly since.<p>Obviously, it would not have rallied without the Fed. But the Fed alone could not have done it. Traders had to feel that the pandemic was going to be much less of a problem than what the 34% selloff indicated.<h3>The study validates common sense</h3><p>Back in February and March, Dr. Fauci was saying Americans should not wear face masks unless a person is infected. He said the purpose of the mask was to prevent a patient from infecting others.<p>When he said that, I thought this was clearly nonsense and probably politically motivated. If everyone buys masks, there would be fewer for doctors and nurses, and the news would make the White House look even more unprepared.<p>Common sense told us that any barrier to the virus reduces our risk. I was wearing masks and gloves and practicing social distancing from the outset. It quickly became clear to everyone that wearing masks and keeping a distance from others made sense. The result was the rate of spread decreased to the point that hospitals could handle the new cases. This study provides a mathematical reason why being careful makes sense.<h3>Vaccine benefit might not last long</h3><p>There are several types of viruses that cause the common cold. These include rhinoviruses, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and coronaviruses.<p>A person recovers from the cold as his body builds an immune response to the virus. Once his body makes enough antibodies, the virus can no longer infect new cells and the white blood cells clean up what virus is left.<p>There is one problem with the immunity that people get when their cold is caused by a coronavirus. It is that the immunity typically only lasts 3 to 6 months. Sometimes, it lasts a year.<h3>Will we need booster shots?</h3><p>The duration of the immunity is a concern for scientists trying to create a vaccine to protect against Covid-19. It is also caused by a coronavirus. If the immunity lasts a year, then the vaccine companies can simply add a coronavirus vaccine to our annual flu shot. No problem.<p>But what happens if the immunity only lasts 3 months? That is a major problem, not only for vaccine makers but for people who recover from Covid-19. It means they can catch it again a few months later.<p>Scientists are confident that they will be able to create a safe and effective vaccine. They will study how long the immunity lasts. They will measure the level of antibodies of immunized patients regularly to see if the immunity goes away. Also, how long will the antibody level be high enough to prevent reinfection?<p>If people can get a Covid-19 infection repeatedly after 3 – 6 months, there would be a floor to the number of infected people in society. Coronavirus would not go away. It would be endemic. There would be a lot of missed work, lower annual income, reduced consumer spending, lower corporate profits, and lower stock prices.<p>No one wants to get a booster shot every 3 months forever. Most people would refuse. The problem could theoretically continue for years until scientists come up with a vaccine that provides longer immunity. A reasonable minimum goal is 1 year of immunity.<h3>Can you get Covid-19 twice?</h3><p>We do not know how long immunity to Covid-19 will last. This is true whether you get immunity from having the infection or from having the disease. If your protective antibodies fall below some critical level, you can get infected again.<p>However, your body now knows how to make these antibodies. It does not have to figure it out again. Also, if you get Covid-19 a 2nd time, you will probably still have some immunity left over from the 1st time. That should reduce the severity of the infection.<p>Since your body already knows what antibodies are need, you will make them sooner. That should reduce the duration of the illness.<p>No one wants Covid-19 one time, let alone 2 times. However, a 2nd case will probably be much less severe.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong follow-through buying in 3 month rally</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-strong-3-bar-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-6-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has strong 3 bar rally\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has been in a bull trend for 11 years. However, it has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years. So far, June is a big bull trend bar. This is only the 1st week in the month. The chart could look very different one the month closes.<p>March broke below the bottom of the range, but reversed up. April was a strong High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. May close on its high and it therefore was a strong entry bar.<p>June is the follow-through bar. So far, it is also strong. Traders are wondering if the rally will continue up to a new all-time high. If June closes near its high, the probability will shift in favor of a new high within a few months.<p>It is still more likely that there will be a 2nd leg sideways to down after the huge Bear Surprise reversal in February and March. However, in 20% of the cases, the 2nd leg down begins after there is a new high.<p>With this rally as strong as it has been, there is currently a 40% chance that it will continue up to a new high before there is a pullback on the monthly chart.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Resumption of strong bull trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-testing-February-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-6-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart testing February gap\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a big bull trend bar this week. The prior 6 weeks were not strongly bullish. They looked like they were starting to form a trading range.<p>This week accelerated up and resumed the V bottom bull trend reversal. This week was a Bull Surprise breakout. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up after the 1st pause or pullback.<p>Since the Emini broke strongly above the March 3 lower high, traders are looking at the next resistance above.<p>An obvious target is the gap above the February 24 high. That high is 3,248.75. This week’s strong rally makes it likely that the Emini will test into that gap.<p>Remember, the Emini rolls over into the September contract this week. That will change all of the prices.<h3>What about a new all-time high?</h3><p>Can the rally continue up to a new all-time high? Of course. Also, the closer the Emini gets to the high and the more strong bull bars it gets, the higher the probability of a new high. Currently, the bulls have a 40% chance of a new high before there is a 15% correction.<p>That means there is still a 60% chance of a lower high. But if next week is another big bull bar, the odds of a new high would be at least 50%.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Parabolic wedge rally with no top yet</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-futures-dailly-candlestick-chart-is-testing-2019-close-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-6-7.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures dailly candlestick chart is testing 2019 close.png\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a parabolic wedge buy climax since it gapped up on May 19. A buy climax can go a long way before the bulls take profits. Also, once they do, the 1st leg down is usually minor.<p>Traders expect at least a micro double top before looking for more than a 1 – 3 day pullback. The odds favor at least slightly higher prices.<p>The Emini is very near the close of 2019. It will probably go above it next week. At that point, the Emini will be up on the year.<p>The big gap down on February 4 is just a little higher. That is a magnet as well, and therefore the Emini might test into it soon.<p>Most breakouts above bull channels fail. The Emini is breaking above a 3 week tight bull channel. This is happening late in a bull trend. Traders should expect at least a minor reversal down within a couple weeks.<p>Friday’s gap up was unusually big. That is another sign of a climax. If the Emini gaps down any day next week, there will be an island top. If there is a gap down and the bears can keep it open for a week or so, traders will begin to look for a swing down.<h3>What is the probability of a new high?</h3><p>The Emini has ignored resistance for 3 months. That is a sign of strong bulls. What we do not know is if the V bottom reversal will make a new high. Is this rally just a strong leg in the 2 1/2 year trading range?<p>Until this week, there was a 70% chance that the rally was going to form a lower high. But there were 5 strong days this week. Also, the Emini broke strongly above the resistance of the 200 day moving average and the March 3 lower high.<p>Traders now believe that the bulls have a 40% chance of a new high before there is more than a 3 day pullback. If next week continues up strongly, the probability will go up to 50 – 60%.<h3>Once there is a reversal, how big will it be?</h3><p>Since the bull trend began in March, every selloff for 3 months reversed back up within 3 days. The bulls have been very eager to buy.<p>At some point, they will take profits. When they do, the bears will see the profit-taking and they will sell as well. This will create a deeper and longer pullback.<p>Once there is a correction, one of the 1st targets is the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the May 14 low of 2760.25. Since that is near 20% down from the high, the Emini would probably fall below that level as well. It would then be back in a bear market.<p>In April, the Emini broke strongly above the March 31 high of 2629.50, but never tested that breakout point. It therefore also a magnet for the bears.<p>Traders are deciding if the rally is a bull leg in the 2 1/2 year trading range or a resumption of the 11 year bull trend. Right now, it is still more likely a leg in the trading range. If it is, traders will expect a reversal down to retrace about half of the rally. That would be about a 15% correction down to around 2700.<p>However, if the rally continues up to a new high, traders will conclude that bull trend has resumed. But most trading range breakouts fail. Consequently, there will probably be sellers not too far above the February all-time high.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

While the rally is a buy climax, there is no top yet. Traders expect at least slightly higher prices.<p>The next target is the 3219.75 close of 2019. Above that is the gap above the February 24 high of 3248.75.<p>Since the rally is very strong, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback, like they have done since the March low. The bears want at least a micro double top or a surprisingly big reversal before looking to sell.<p>The bulls who bought in February are relieved that they can now exit around breakeven. Those who bought at the bottom in March will want to take some profits. Consequently, the rally will likely stall around the February all-time high.<p>That means the Emini will probably enter a trading range for a week or two. When there is a trading range on the daily chart, there is more trading range price action on the 5 minute chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. It will probably open around last week’s high. There are magnets just above and the bull trend is strong.<p>While traders expect at least slightly higher prices, the Emini is now in a zone where the bulls will begin to take some profits Also, last week’s 200 point rally was exceptional. It is therefore unsustainable and climactic. That will probably make the bulls less eager to buy. Some will begin to take profits.<p>While traders expect at least slightly higher prices, the next several days will probably start to go sideways. That means that day traders will look for more swings up and down. Last week’s strong rally will probably evolve into a trading range this week.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-trading-range-open-and-then-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-8.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range open and then parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It followed a pair of big bull bars. They probably represent a blow-off in a strong rally.<p>Traders expect a pullback to at least the bottom of those 2 bull bars soon. There is often on more brief leg up before the pullback.<p>The bulls obviously want a break above the March high. However, it is more likely that enough bulls will use this as a good opportunity to take some profits. It is therefore more likely that the EURUSD will pull back to below 1.12 before going above the March high at around 1.15.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market traded below Friday’s low overnight. This triggered the sell signal on the daily chart.<p>However, it only dipped a little below Friday’s low and then reversed up. The bulls want today to close near its high. It would then be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Remember, where there is an exhaustive buy climax, there is often one more leg up before there is a pullback to the bottom of the buy climax. The chart often goes sideways for many bars before deciding whether to have that additional final leg up or begin to pull back.<p>Eight consecutive bull bars on the daily chart is a sign of extremely strong bulls. There will probably be at least a few sideways days before the bears can get a reversal down to 1.12.<p>When there is indecision, there is confusion. Daytraders tend to take quick profits. Furthermore, since they expect small moves up and down, they look to buy low and sell high. This typically results in a trading range. There is therefore an increased chance of trading range trading for a few days.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-channel-and-positive-on-the-year.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-8-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel and positive on the year\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It is now up for the year.<p>There is also a gap on the daily and weekly charts around 3250. That is another gap above.<p>Because the March crash was so severe, there are bulls who bought in February who will be relieved to be able to get out around breakeven. Also, the bulls who bought the reversal up in March will want to take some profits.<p>This supply might take some time to work through. Therefore, the strong rally of the past couple weeks will probably evolve into a trading range soon. Tomorrow’s FOMC announcement might also lead to trading range trading today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 23 points in the Globex session. Traders know that the rally on the daily chart last week was extreme. They expect the bulls to be exhausted. There is therefore an increased chance of the rally evolving into a trading range this week.<p>It is important to note that even though yesterday was a bull trend day, 68 of the 1st 72 bars were trading range bars. Traders expect more trading range price action today.<p>Yesterday was a Spike and Channel bull trend. There is typically a reversal down to the start of the channel. That was the pullback at 9:30 AM PST yesterday. Then, the chart usually evolves into a trading range. Today will open around that target. There is therefore an increased chance of a trading range that begins on the open.<p>Since the buy climax on the daily chart will probably pause this week, there is an increased chance of a couple bear trend days over the next week or so.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-channel-and-positive-on-the-year.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-9.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel and positive on the year\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is a High 1 bull flag.<p>However, there were consecutive big bull bars last week. Because they came late in a bull trend, they probably will attract profit takers. There is often one more brief leg up before the profit taking begins.<p>It is important to note that there does not have to be a pullback. The rally could continue to far above the March high without more than a 2 day pause. But that would be unusual after last week’s consecutive big bull days.<p>Once the bulls take profits, the 1st downside target is the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That means the low of those 2 bull bars from last week. That would be about a 200 pip pullback to below 1.12. It would also be a test of the March 16 breakout point.<p>If the pullback fell further over the next couple of weeks, it could test the May 1 high. That is the top of the 2 month trading range and the neckline of the head and shoulders bottom.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off last night to below yesterday’s low and rallied back to the open. Today so far is a doji bar on the daily chart, like yesterday.<p>Since yesterday is a buy signal bar, the bulls want today to go above yesterday’s high. That would trigger the High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart.<p>If it does not, today would be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. Traders expect an attempt to resume the bull trend on the daily chart. Therefore either today should go above yesterday’s high or tomorrow should go above today’s high to trigger the buy signal.<p>But doji bars are weak buy signal bars, especially after a buy climax. Consequently, there might be more sellers than buyers above the buy signal bar.<p>Can today reverse back down and close on its low? Probably not. Traders are exhausted and the trading over the past 2 days has been quiet. That reduces the chance of a big move today.<p>If there is a big move, up is more likely because yesterday is a buy signal bar in a bull trend. So far, day traders have been scalping up and down. That will probably continue all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-wedge-opening-reversal-then-big-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge opening reversal then big wedge top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It is now up for the year.<p>There is also a gap on the daily and weekly charts around 3250. That is another gap above.<p>Because the March crash was so severe, there are bulls who bought in February who will be relieved to be able to get out around breakeven. Also, the bulls who bought the reversal up in March will want to take some profits.<p>This supply might take some time to work through. Therefore, the strong rally of the past couple weeks will probably evolve into a trading range soon. Tomorrow’s FOMC announcement might also lead to trading range trading today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 23 points in the Globex session. Traders know that the rally on the daily chart last week was extreme. They expect the bulls to be exhausted. There is therefore an increased chance of the rally evolving into a trading range this week.<p>It is important to note that even though yesterday was a bull trend day, 68 of the 1st 72 bars were trading range bars. Traders expect more trading range price action today.<p>Yesterday was a Spike and Channel bull trend. There is typically a reversal down to the start of the channel. That was the pullback at 9:30 AM PST yesterday. Then, the chart usually evolves into a trading range. Today will open around that target. There is therefore an increased chance of a trading range that begins on the open.<p>Since the buy climax on the daily chart will probably pause this week, there is an increased chance of a couple bear trend days over the next week or so.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-channel-and-positive-on-the-year.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-9.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel and positive on the year\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-high-1-bull-flag-but-after-exhaustive-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-9-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has pulled back for 2 days after a strong rally. This is a High 1 bull flag.<p>However, there were consecutive big bull bars last week. Because they came late in a bull trend, they probably will attract profit takers. There is often one more brief leg up before the profit taking begins.<p>It is important to note that there does not have to be a pullback. The rally could continue to far above the March high without more than a 2 day pause. But that would be unusual after last week’s consecutive big bull days.<p>Once the bulls take profits, the 1st downside target is the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That means the low of those 2 bull bars from last week. That would be about a 200 pip pullback to below 1.12. It would also be a test of the March 16 breakout point.<p>If the pullback fell further over the next couple of weeks, it could test the May 1 high. That is the top of the 2 month trading range and the neckline of the head and shoulders bottom.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off last night to below yesterday’s low and rallied back to the open.

Therefore either today should go above yesterday’s high or tomorrow should go above today’s high to trigger the buy signal.<p>But doji bars are weak buy signal bars, especially after a buy climax.

But will it continue up to a new high? Despite the strong rally, the odds still favor a pullback for several weeks before a new high. However, one or two big bull days will make the new high more likely.<p>Today is an FOMC day. No one expects any surprise from the Fed. However, there is usually a strong move up or down after the 11 am PST report.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Yesterday was a pullback in a strong bull trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex session. Traders expect it to trade above yesterday’s high and trigger the bull signal. They also expect the rally to reach the gap above the February 24 high this week.<p>But the rally has been exceptionally strong. Stops for the bulls are far below so risk is great. Traders will soon begin to take some profits to reduce their risk.<p>The strong rally on the daily chart should evolve into a trading range. A trading range on the daily chart typically results in more trading range price action on the 5 minute chart.<p>Today’s 11 am PST FOMC announcement is a catalyst for a surprisingly big move up or down. Day traders should be out of positions ahead of the report. Most FOMC announcements result in sharp moves up and down within the first few minutes. Day traders should wait at least 10 minutes after the announcement before resuming trading.<p>They should treat the market at that point as if it is the start of a new day.

However, the 2 big bull bars last week is probably an exhaustion move.<p>There would normally be a 70% chance that a minor reversal down will begin this week. However, today’s FOMC meeting makes it a little less likely, so maybe there is a 60% chance.<p>The target for the minor reversal down is the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the low of last week’s 2 big bull bars. It might take a week or so to get there once a reversal begins.<p>The rally has been very strong. Traders expect a break above the March high after the pullback. There is a 40% chance that the breakout will come without more than a 3 day pullback.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed down after briefly breaking above last week’s high. Therefore bulls were taking profits and bears were selling the breakout. This increases the chance of a small double top with that high.<p>Day traders will look to sell reversals down from the high, betting on the small double top. Since there has not been a strong reversal down, the bulls will keep buying selloffs, hoping to be able to get today to close far above last week’s high.<p>Today’s FOMC meeting at 11 am PST is a potential catalyst for a big move up or down. Day traders should exit positions ahead of the report. Furthermore, there is typically a quick move up and down immediately after the report. Therefore, day traders should wait for at least 10 minutes after the report before trading again.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-FOMC-and-trading-range-day-closing-on-the-low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC and trading range day closing on the low.pptx\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was then sideways ahead of the 11 am PST FOMC announcement. It rallied on the report, but reversed down for a 3rd day at the close of last year. It finished the day near low of the day.<p>Today was the 2nd day of a pullback. Every pullback since March ended by the 3rd day. Each was a pullback, which is a bull flag. Consequently, traders expect this pullback to be a bull flag. The buy signal triggers when a day goes above the high of the prior day. With today having a bear body on the daily chart, it is a weak buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Traders expect the rally to test the gap on the daily and weekly chart above the February 24 high. If the bulls get a couple big bull days, the rally will probably continue up to a new high.<p>Currently, it is more likely that the Emini will stall around the gap and then pull back for several weeks. The bears will need a couple big bear days to convince traders that this week is the start of the correction.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Therefore, day traders should wait for at least 10 minutes after the report before trading again.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-FOMC-and-trading-range-day-closing-on-the-low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC and trading range day closing on the low.pptx\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was then sideways ahead of the 11 am PST FOMC announcement. It rallied on the report, but reversed down for a 3rd day at the close of last year. It finished the day near low of the day.<p>Today was the 2nd day of a pullback. Every pullback since March ended by the 3rd day. Each was a pullback, which is a bull flag. Consequently, traders expect this pullback to be a bull flag. The buy signal triggers when a day goes above the high of the prior day. With today having a bear body on the daily chart, it is a weak buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Traders expect the rally to test the gap on the daily and weekly chart above the February 24 high. If the bulls get a couple big bull days, the rally will probably continue up to a new high.<p>Currently, it is more likely that the Emini will stall around the gap and then pull back for several weeks. The bears will need a couple big bear days to convince traders that this week is the start of the correction.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Every pullback ended within 3 days. Yesterday was the 2nd day of a pullback from testing the close of 2019. It is a buy signal bar for today. But it has a bear body and it is has failed 3 times at the resistance of the 2019 close.<p>Traders expect that there is a lot of supply around the February high. This should lead to a 10 – 15% pullback from around that high.<h3>Is this the start of a 10 – 15% pullback?</h3><p>It is too early to say. The bears will need a couple big bear days for traders to conclude that a correction might be underway.<p>The rally over the past couple weeks has been exceptionally strong. If the bulls get a reversal back up within a few days, the rally will probably continue to above the February 24 high. That high is the bottom of a gap on both the daily and weekly charts.<p>At the moment, the Emini is more likely to pull back for several weeks before making a new high. Therefore, traders expect the upside to be limited from here this month.<h3>Possible island top</h3><p>When there was that big gap up on Friday, I said it was a possible exhaustion gap on the daily chart. I also said that there could be a gap down this week, which could create an island top.<p>Most island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns. But this rally is an extreme buy climax after a crash in March. It is now testing the old high. Many buyers from February are relieved to be able to exit with much of a loss.<p>That increases the chance of a swing down from here for a few weeks. Today’s big gap down could be the start of that swing down. It will be more likely if today is a big bear day on the daily chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Today is rollover day in the Emini. Most day traders will still trade the June contract until tomorrow. They will then switch to September.<p>The Emini is down 80 points in the Globex session. There will be a big gap down on the open. That will create an island top with last week’s gap up.<p>When there is a big gap down, there is only a 20% chance of a strong bull or bear trend from the open. Traders expect some early trading range trading for the 1st hour or two.<p>The bulls will look for a double bottom or wedge bottom to buy for a swing up. However, the bears want to sell around the EMA. They will look for a wedge rally to the EMA or a double top around the EMA. They will short for a swing down.<p>If there is a trading range open, it would be a sign of balance. That usually reduces the chance of the day trending strongly all day. If there is a strong trend, it typically will not last until the close.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-FOMC-and-trading-range-day-closing-on-the-low.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-11.png\" alt=\"Emini FOMC and trading range day closing on the low.pptx\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is often a brief 2nd leg up before the bulls take profits.<p>Yesterday is a good candidate for that 2nd leg up and the end of the rally for the next week or two. Today so far is a bear day. If it closes near its low, it would be a reasonable sell signal bar.<p>If this is the start of a pullback, the 1st target is the bottom of the 2 day buy climax. That is the June 3 low, which is just below 1.1200. It usually is around the EMA. If the bears break below that, the next targets are breakout points below. These are the March 27 and May 1 highs.<p>The bulls want any reversal down to end after a day or two. They then want the rally to quickly continue up to above the March high.<p>However, this particular pattern has a 70% chance of testing the June 3 buy climax low before going much higher. Even if the bull trend continued up after just a one day pullback, traders will look for a small wedge top with the June 5 and June 10 highs begin the 1st 2 legs up. Traders expect a pullback starting now or after one more brief leg up.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a broad trading range. It is currently near the low of the day. Many bulls on the daily chart are starting to sell rallies to take profits. The bears know see that and they are selling rallies as well.<p>If today closes near its low, it will be a sell signal bar on the daily chart. An increasing number of bulls will begin to sell at the market and on downside breakouts instead of on rallies.<p>If that happens, the EURUSD will start to have bear trend days. That means there will be several bear trends on the 5 minute chart.<p>So far, the bulls are buying selloffs and the bears are buying back their shorts around the prior low. That is creating the overnight trading range. But there is an increased chance of swings down on the 5 minute chart over the next few days.<p>Remember, there is a 30% chance that the 3 week rally continues up to above the March high without a pullback to the June 3 low. Consequently, traders will swing trade longs if there is a strong rally today or tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bear-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bear Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This was a crash day. There were waves of relentless selling.<p>On the daily chart, today was a huge bear candlestick. This is a Bear Major Surprise Bar on the daily chart. Traders should expect lower prices. I have been saying that the correction would be about 15%. That is still likely. With today’s selloff, the Emini is almost halfway there.<p>On the weekly chart, this week is now an outside down candlestick. Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance will be important. This is especially true in the final hour. The bulls want the week to close above the 3000 Big Round Number and last week’s low. They hope that today is just a bear trap and that the Emini will still make a new high this month.<p>The bears want this to be the start of a 15% selloff. It is a good candidate. They want tomorrow to be a bear day. Also, they want the week to close on the low. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>Since today was a sell climax, there will probably be at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The selloff on the daily chart began in the sell zone around the March 3 high.<p>Because the range was big, traders expect at least some follow-through selling at some point within a week or so. At the moment, many traders believe the pullback will reach around the 2800 bottom of the early May trading range.<p>Yesterday was extremely climactic. A bear channel is a bull flag. Today should have at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading. But there is often some follow-through selling on the open after a big bear day.<p>It is unlikely that the bears will get a 2nd big bear day. If they did, that would make traders expect a big, fast reversal down over the next several weeks.<p>The bulls want today to be a bull day. They especially want a big bull day closing on its high. That would increase the chance that yesterday was just a sell vacuum test of the 200 day moving average. Traders would then wonder if it was a bear trap. The bulls would be more inclined to buy again next week. Traders need more information today and Monday to decide if yesterday was the start of a correction or just a brief test of support.<p>Today is Friday. The bears want the week to close on its low and below both last week’s low and the 3000 Big Round Number. The bulls hope that yesterday was a bear trap and that today rallies strongly.

The selloff on the daily chart began in the sell zone around the March 3 high.<p>Because the range was big, traders expect at least some follow-through selling at some point within a week or so. At the moment, many traders believe the pullback will reach around the 2800 bottom of the early May trading range.<p>Yesterday was extremely climactic. A bear channel is a bull flag. Today should have at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading. But there is often some follow-through selling on the open after a big bear day.<p>It is unlikely that the bears will get a 2nd big bear day. If they did, that would make traders expect a big, fast reversal down over the next several weeks.<p>The bulls want today to be a bull day. They especially want a big bull day closing on its high. That would increase the chance that yesterday was just a sell vacuum test of the 200 day moving average. Traders would then wonder if it was a bear trap. The bulls would be more inclined to buy again next week. Traders need more information today and Monday to decide if yesterday was the start of a correction or just a brief test of support.<p>Today is Friday. The bears want the week to close on its low and below both last week’s low and the 3000 Big Round Number. The bulls hope that yesterday was a bear trap and that today rallies strongly.

Traders expect lower prices over the next couple weeks.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market reversed last week’s selloff. It is back in the middle of its 3 month trading range. Traders expect more sideways trading, even if the market rallies next week.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has rallied in a minor parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart. It should pull back for a week or two.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures weekly chart:</strong><br>Failed bear breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-with-failed-breakout-below-tight-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-13.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart with failed breakout below tight trading range\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures on the weekly chart reversed last week’s selloff. For the bulls, last week was simply a sharp pullback to the 20 week EMA. The bond futures are now back in their 2 month tight trading range.<p>For the bulls, this week is now a buy signal bar. They see this week’s reversal as a failed breakout below a tight trading range and a triangle.<p>Furthermore, this week is reversing up from a higher low double bottom with the March 18 low. They want the this week to be the start of a resumption of the January to March rally.<h3>Is this a resumption of the bull trend on the weekly chart?</h3><p>What do the bulls need to do to convince traders that the bull trend is resuming on the weekly chart? They need many more bars in the trading range and then a strong breakout above that trading range. Then, traders will think that the bulls might get a new all-time high.<p>Alternatively, the bulls need a strong break above the March high. Then traders will wonder about a measured move up, possibly based on the March range.<p>At the moment, there is a 70% chance that this week’s reversal will be just a leg in the 3 month trading range. There is only a 30% chance that it will lead to a series of bull bars and a break above the March high.<h3>Strong reversal up, but the monthly chart is a problem</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-with-failed-breakout-below-ii-pattern.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-13-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart with failed breakout below ii pattern\"></a></figure><p>While the reversal up on the weekly chart is strong, the monthly chart is a problem for the bulls. The reversal down in March was strong. Additionally, the 3 month rally was the most extreme buy climax in history on the monthly chart. A 3 bar (month) pullback is probably not enough to lead to a resumption of the bull trend. Traders wanting to buy typically expect a couple legs sideways to down and lasting about 10 bars.<p>On the monthly chart, that means about a year. Therefore, this week’s reversal up will probably be the start of a bull leg in the trading range that began 3 months ago and not of a resumption of the 20 year bull trend.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex weekly chart:</strong><br>Profit taking after minor parabolic buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-testing-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-13-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart testing bear trend line\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart rallied strongly for 3 weeks. This week stalled at the bear trend line from the February 2018 high to the March high.<p>The bears see this week as a sell signal bar for another lower high in the 2 year bear channel. They want next week to trade below this week’s low. That would trigger the weekly sell signal.<p>But the 3 week rally was exceptionally strong. Consequently, there probably will be more buyers than sellers not too far below this week’s low. Traders expect a 1 – 3 week pullback and then at least one more test back up.<p>If the EURUSD reverses down a 2nd time, there would be a micro double top. The bears then would have a better chance of a reversal back down to below the middle of the yearlong tight trading range.<h3>Parabolic wedge buy climax on the daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-testing-bear-trend-line-and-forming-double-top-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-13-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart testing bear trend line and forming double top\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly for 3 weeks. Last week had consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs. In addition, they were the 2 biggest consecutive bull bars in the rally. They therefore formed a likely exhaustive buy climax.<p>When there is a pair of big bull bars coming late in a bull trend, traders see them as a great opportunity to take profits. The bulls now have what they believe will be a brief chance to lock in windfall profits.<p>At the close of the 2nd big bull bar, there is a 60% chance that either the 2 bull bars will be the end of the rally or that there will one more brief leg up. There was a brief leg up this week that reversed down on Thursday.<h3>First downside target is bottom of most recent buy climax</h3><p>Traders now expect at least a couple legs sideways to down. The 1st downside target is the bottom of that 2 bar buy climax. That June 3 low is just below 1.1200 and about 200 pips down from this week’s high.<p>Many bears who sell the buy climax will take profits there. Additionally, the bulls see that the market rallied strongly at that price a couple weeks ago. They wonder if there will again be strong buying there.<p>The pullback to the bottom of the most recent buy climax typically results in at least a bounce. If the selloff is strong, many bulls will wait for at least a micro double bottom before buying again.<p>Can the reversal down be the start if a bear trend? A strong bull trend usually does not reverse into a bear trend without 1st transitioning into a trading range. Consequently, traders will assume that the 200 pip selloff will be a bear leg in a trading range or a bull flag instead of the start of a bear trend.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Reversal down at top of 2 1/2 year trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-forming-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-13-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart forming lower high major trend reversal.\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a bull trend for 11 years. However, the huge January/February selloff was a Bear Surprise. A Bear Surprise has a 70% chance of a 2nd leg sideways to down. In 80% of cases, the 2nd leg begins from a lower high. That is why I have been saying that the strong 3 month reversal up was likely to fail.<p>June so far is a reversal bar on the monthly chart. It rallied and sold off. The Emini is currently near the low of the month. If the month were to close here, it would be a sell signal bar.<p>This month is bad follow-through after a good entry bar in May. May triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. It closed on its high, which was bullish. But so far, June is not providing follow-through buying. That weakens the prospects for the bulls.<p>They had a good buy signal bar in April, a good entry bar in May, but bad follow-through in June. Disappointment is a hallmark of a trading range. June is a reminder that the monthly chart is still in a trading range<h3>Trading range for the rest of the year</h3><p>Remember, I have been saying that the monthly chart has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years and that it will probably remain in the range for the rest of the year. Therefore, if the Emini trades down next month, the selloff will likely be minor.<p>There is plenty of time remaining in June. It could look very different from what it does now. For example, the stock market often rallies at the end of June. That is the end of the quarter and just before the 4th of July holiday. Holidays generally come with some euphoria.&nbsp;<p>At the moment, June is unlikely to close on its high. However, it could close in the middle of its range. It would then be less bearish going into July.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Last week’s bull breakout has failed</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-failed-breakout-above-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-13-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart failed breakout above trading range\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed down strongly this week. Last week was a breakout above 6 weak bars on the weekly chart. The bulls were hoping that the breakout would continue up to a new all-time high.<p>As a rule, 50% of all breakouts fail. Sometimes the context and size of the breakout makes it more likely to be successful. However, I wrote last week that there was still less than a 50% chance that it would lead to a new high.<p>This week totally erased last week’s rally. In fact, this week traded above last week’s high and then below its low. This week is therefore an outside down candlestick. That is bearish when it comes late in a bull trend.<p>This week’s selloff has created a 2 week reversal on the weekly chart. While bearish, the Emini is a tight bull channel. If this is the start of a selloff, the selloff will probably not fall below the March low. This is similar to the rally, which I have been saying would probably not go above the February high.<h3>Markets have inertia</h3><p>The Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years. Trading ranges often look the most bearish at the low, like in March, and then reverse up. They also look the most bullish near the high.<p>Traders should expect reversals and not breakouts. This is because of my 80% rule. Markets have inertia. They have a strong tendency to continue what they have been going. In trends, 80% of reversal attempts fail. In trading ranges, 80% of breakout attempts fail and reverse.<h3>How low will it go?</h3><p>One target is a measured move based on the height of this week’s outside down range. That target 2750. Another is the bottom of the most recent leg up or trading range. That is the lows below 2800.<p>Traders typically look for a 50% retracement. That is around 2700.<p>Ten percent corrections are also common. But with how extreme the buy climax was, 15% is more likely. That would be around 2750.<p>Finally, the market is now more than 10% down from the high. It is therefore back in correction territory. If it falls 20% down, which is 2700, it would be back in a bear market. I have written many times that I think the approximate trading range for the remainder of the year will probably be around 10 to 20% down from the high.<p>The low of that range is around 2700. Since there is a cluster of magnets around 2700 to 2800, traders should expect the Emini will get there this summer.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Double top with the February high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-failed-breakout-parabolic-wedge-top-and-close-of-2019-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-13-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart failed breakout parabolic wedge top and close of 2019\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed down sharply on Thursday. Friday was the 4th day in the selloff. This is the 1st 4 day pullback since the rally began in March.<p>This could be the start of a reversal down from a double top with the February all-time high. When there are double tops, the 2nd high is rarely exactly at the same price as the 1st high. This is a lower high double top.<p>A big bear bar like the one on Thursday is a Bear Surprise breakout. Friday’s bear body confirmed the reversal down. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>I mentioned last weekend that last Friday”s gap up was exceptionally big and it was testing the top of the 2 year trading range. That increased the chance that it was an exhaustive move.<p>I said that the Emini might gap down some day this week and create an island top. Thursday’s gap down did just that. Island tops and bottoms are usually minor reversal patterns.<p>However, this one is after an extreme buy climax. That buy climax followed a huge sell climax. Therefore the rally was probably going to form a lower high.<p>What happens if there is a gap up some day next week? That would create an island bottom with Thursday’s gap down. If there was a strong rally, traders will see Thursday as a bear trap and wonder if the rally will resume up to the February high.<p>The 3 month bull channel has been strong. There is therefore still a 40% chance that Thursday was a bear trap and the bull trend will resume next week.<h3>Why did the market sell off?</h3><p>The news always reports that every market move is caused by the news. That is because they believe they are the center of the universe and they do not believe that technical forces exist.<p>They therefore are now claiming that the Fed’s comments this week and an increase in Covid-19 cases caused the selloff. That influenced many traders to sell.<p>But why is it that I have been saying that the rally would fail to break above the February high? It is because of technical factors, which control all moves lasting a few months or less.<h3>Markets constantly search for the ever-changing fair price</h3><p>The market is always testing up and down. It needs to find out how far up and down are too far. The market is probing to find the current fair price.<p>That price changes constantly with every second. The result is that the fair price is a range and not any one price.<p>I have been saying that no one knew where the top of the rally would be. But, I said with 70% certainty where it would not be. The March selloff was so strong that the rally only had a 30% chance of making a new high. It got near the old high this week.<p>That meant it was likely to go sideways and then down or simply down. It chose down.<h3>The news is the catalyst but not the cause</h3><p>Some selling was created by the news, but the selling was going to happen regardless. This is the same as in February when I said the market was going to selloff or in March when I said traders should expect a big V bottom rally.<p>There is always news at every second of every day. When the market moves, the reporters look at the current news and claim that it was the cause of the move. Nonsense.<p>Think of the impending move as a bomb. The news flipped the ignition switch.<p>If it was not this news, it was going to be some other news. The news can affect the speed and size of the move, like how our bungling of the pandemic led to the March crash. But there was going to be a selloff regardless of whether there was a pandemic. It might have come a month or two later, but it was going to come.<h3>Bulls and bears were looking to sell near the February high</h3><p>I said that there was a lot of supply around the February high. All of the traders who bought in January and February and did not exit watched a 35% selloff. That is huge.<p>Many were going to be afraid that the market might not make a new high for a long time. They were hoping that the rally would get near their entry price so they could exit with a smaller loss. They did that this week.<p>Many bulls bought around the March low. They knew there would be supply around the old high. Many took profits this week.<p>Finally, the bears knew that the selloff was so extreme in March that many bulls would sell near the old high. They therefore sold as well.<p>All of these sellers created Thursday’s crash.<p>The 3 month rally went higher than what was likely. Because it was stretched far, traders will expect a bigger reversal down over the next few weeks.<h3>Sideways to down is likely for a few weeks</h3><p>Can Thursday be a bear trap and will the Emini immediately reverse back up? The bulls have a 20% chance.<p>It is important to remember that the Emini has been in a trading for 2 1/2 years. Traders should expect disappointing follow-through after any move up and down. This week was disappointing for the bulls after last week’s exceptionally strong rally. The selloff will probably not fall in a strong bear trend. That will disappoint the bears.<p>However, there is a 60% chance that this selloff is the start of a 15% pullback to around 2750. I talked about the reasons for this in the section above on the weekly chart.<h3>March 31 high just above 2600 is a magnet below</h3><p>There is an additional reason for a possible 15% correction on the daily chart. The March 31 high was never adequately tested.<p>There is a gap between the April 21 low and that high. Gaps in trading ranges typically close. Consequently, if this selloff gets near 2700, it will probably continue down to below the March 31 high.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There was a big bear day on Thursday and another bear day on Friday.<p>Friday was the 4th day in the pullback. Every other pullback in the 3 month rally ended no later than the 3rd day.<p>This is probably the start of a swing down. There is now a lower low double top with the February high. Also, the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years. The 3 month rally was a test of the top of the range.<p>If this is the start of a bear leg, it will probably continue down about 15% to around 2700. The bulls want the bear reversal to fail, but need to get at least a couple strong bull bars this week. Without that, traders will expect lower prices. However, since the selloff will be a bear leg in the 2.5 year trading range and not a bear trend, it will have strong bounces along the way.<p>Last week was an outside down week in a buy climax. It is therefore a sell signal bar on the weekly chart for this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 60 points in the Globex session. It will therefore gap down below Friday’s close. It might even gap below last week’s low. If it does, the gap on the weekly chart will be small. Most small gaps close. Traders would look for a test of Friday’s low, which is last week’s low, in the 1st hour today.<p>Can today be another big bear day? With a gap down on the weekly chart, there is an increased chance that this week will be a big bear bar on the weekly chart.<p>If it is, there will probably be at least a couple big bear days on the daily chart. A selloff from a parabolic wedge rally usually tests the start of the wedge rally. That was the May 19 low around the 2900 Big Round Number.<p>However, the selling has been extreme. Also, after 3 bear days, many bears will be looking to take some profits. There is now a 2 day trading range on the 60 minute chart. Today will open near the bottom of that range. This reduces the chance of a big selloff today. More likely, the Emini will continue that range and probably bounce for a couple days this week.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bear-trend-and-then-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-15.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend and then bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Traders expect a minimum of 2 legs sideways to down. In addition, they believe the selloff will reach the EMA and the bottom of the final 2 day buy climax, which is 1.1167.<p>Last week is a weak sell signal bar on the weekly chart. This week will probably trade below last week’s low to trigger the minor sell signal. However, because the reversal down will probably be minor, there might be more buyers than sellers below last week’s low. Remember, traders are expecting at least 2 legs down. They therefore expect at least one brief rally along the way.<p>The bulls want a double bottom bull flag with the June 9 low and a resumption of the bull trend this week. Most traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. They will therefore sell the 1st bounce.<p>There is only a 30% chance of a rally this week that goes above last week’s high without at least a 2nd leg sideways to down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 40 pip trading range overnight. Day traders are looking for 10 – 20 pip scalps up or down. They know that 2 legs sideways to down are likely. Therefore, they expect a bounce for a day or two this week. But they will sell the rally, expecting a test of the June 3 low.<p>Any day can suddenly break into a trend. But the bulls will probably need a buy signal bar on the daily chart before the 5 minute chart can have a trend up. That reduces the chance of a bull trend day today.<p>Last week is a weak sell signal bar on the weekly chart. There will probably be buyers below its low. That reduces the chance of a strong selloff from here.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It failed to get above Friday’s high and form an outside up day.<p>There have not been 4 consecutive bear days since February. After 3 consecutive bear days, today was likely to close above the open. It closed near the high and it is a High 1 buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>However, after a surprisingly strong 3 days down, traders expect a 2 – 3 day bounce to a lower high and then a 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>If tomorrow gaps up, there will be a 3 day island bottom. While good for the bulls, island tops and bottoms are usually minor reversal patterns.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

For the bulls, yesterday is a buy signal bar on the daily chart. They see the 5 day selloff as a High 1 bull flag buy signal.<p>If today gaps up, there will be a 3 day island bottom. However, island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns.<p>The 3 day selloff was surprisingly strong. Therefore, if today triggers the buy signal by going above yesterday’s high, the breakout could be minor. That means another failed attempt to break to a new all-time high.<p>I have talked about the gap on the daily and weekly charts above the February 24 high many times. It is very big and not far above. That makes it an important magnet. Many traders want to see the Emini test into it before they are willing to look for a 15% correction. Yesterday’s strong rally and today’s likely big gap up make it likely that the Emini will try to get there within a week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 78 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open with a big gap up and create a 3 day island bottom. If today is not a big bear day, the rally will probably continue up to the gap above the February 24 high within a week.<p>A big gap up means that the Emini will be far above the EMA. Traders do not want to pay far above an average price unless the bars are much more bullish than average. Since yesterday was also a big bull day, the Emini is very overbought. That will further make bulls hesitant to buy aggressively on the open. They would prefer to buy closer to the average price.<p>What typically happens when there is a big gap up is that the Emini enters a trading range for the 1st hour or two. Once it gets closer to the EMA, the bulls will look to buy again.<p>The bears want the gap up to fail. They want a strong bear trend from the open. That is unlikely. The chart is telling traders that traders want a test of the February 24 gap. Therefore, if there is a strong selloff on the open, there would probably be a reversal up within a couple hours. Today is not likely going to be a strong bear trend day. Most likely, it will be either a trading range day or a weak bull day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-16.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That reduces the chance that the selloff will be strong and fall far.<p>The lack of conviction on the part of sellers will increase the amount of trading range price action during the leg down. Day traders will be willing to buy as well as sell.

For the bulls, yesterday is a buy signal bar on the daily chart. They see the 5 day selloff as a High 1 bull flag buy signal.<p>If today gaps up, there will be a 3 day island bottom. However, island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns.<p>The 3 day selloff was surprisingly strong. Therefore, if today triggers the buy signal by going above yesterday’s high, the breakout could be minor. That means another failed attempt to break to a new all-time high.<p>I have talked about the gap on the daily and weekly charts above the February 24 high many times. It is very big and not far above. That makes it an important magnet. Many traders want to see the Emini test into it before they are willing to look for a 15% correction. Yesterday’s strong rally and today’s likely big gap up make it likely that the Emini will try to get there within a week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 78 points in the Globex session.

That gap up formed a 3 day island bottom.<p>However, the Emini collapsed to below Monday’s high and closed the gap. It the rallied from there and went sideways for the rest of the day. The 2 day rally is strong enough for traders to expect at least slightly higher prices this week.<p>When the market has big moves up and down, traders trade the reversals. They buy low, sell high, and take quick profits. The result is a trading range. This could last for several days.<p>A trading range is a balanced market. Neither side has a big advantage. The bulls want the rally to continue up to the gap on the weekly chart above the February 24 high. They then want a new all-time high.<p>However, the bears want a lower high and then a 15% correction. Despite the strong 3 month rally, a 2nd leg sideways to down is likely after the February/March crash. This is true even if there is a new high first. At the moment, a lower high is more likely.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 12 points in the Globex session. Yesterday ended with a double bottom higher low major trend reversal. That increases the chance of higher prices today.<p>But the 2 day rally was extreme. It is therefore unsustainable and climactic. The bulls are probably exhausted. That means that the Emini might have to go sideways more today, like it did for most of yesterday.<p>Can today form a big bear trend day? After a strong reversal up for 2 days and with magnets above, day traders are expecting more sideways to up trading.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-wedge-double-top-and-failed-island-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-17.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double top and failed island bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That lower high is the right shoulder in a 3 week head and shoulders top. But the rally in June was especially strong. Therefore, this selloff is more likely a pullback from that rally than the start of a bear trend.<p>The minimum targets for the bears are the EMA and the June 3 low. That is the final leg up in the 3 week buy climax.<p>The trading range in April and May was a head and shoulders bottom. After a reversal up from a bottom, there is often a pullback to the breakout point. That is the top of that trading range, which is around 1.10. This pullback might continue down to that level before the bulls buy again. They want a 2nd leg up after their strong 3 week rally.<p>The daily chart has been sideways for 3 weeks. Traders expect it to get to the June 3 low before the bulls might buy aggressively again.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a small rally early in the overnight session, but then sold off to a new low. It will be difficult for the bulls to create a strong rally until after the selloff reaches the June 3 low. The incentive just isn’t there. Why buy above that level when traders know that it is a strong magnet and they can probably buy lower?<p>Can the EURUSD collapse below the June low? That is not what typically happens. Usually there is some buying there. The bears take profits and the bulls begin to buy. If there is strong buying, the bull trend can resume. More often, the chart will spend a few days there deciding if the selloff will continue down to the next support.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways for 3 weeks. Traders are not expecting a big move up or down. Day traders are looking for scalps, but when there is a strong breakout up or down, they will hold for 30 – 50 pip swings. They know that big trends are unlikely while the daily chart is in pullback mode.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-then-wedge-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and then wedge double top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed back down and closed near the low. That late selloff was bear trend resumption in a trading range day.<p>Today was an inside day on the daily chart. It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for tomorrow. Because of its bear body, it is a weak buy signal bar. The strong 2 day rally reduces the chance of a reversal down. Therefore, the Emini has an increased chance of going sideways again tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

At the moment, a lower high is more likely.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 12 points in the Globex session. Yesterday ended with a double bottom higher low major trend reversal. That increases the chance of higher prices today.<p>But the 2 day rally was extreme. It is therefore unsustainable and climactic. The bulls are probably exhausted. That means that the Emini might have to go sideways more today, like it did for most of yesterday.<p>Can today form a big bear trend day? After a strong reversal up for 2 days and with magnets above, day traders are expecting more sideways to up trading.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-wedge-double-top-and-failed-island-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-17.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge double top and failed island bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That lower high is the right shoulder in a 3 week head and shoulders top. But the rally in June was especially strong. Therefore, this selloff is more likely a pullback from that rally than the start of a bear trend.<p>The minimum targets for the bears are the EMA and the June 3 low. That is the final leg up in the 3 week buy climax.<p>The trading range in April and May was a head and shoulders bottom. After a reversal up from a bottom, there is often a pullback to the breakout point. That is the top of that trading range, which is around 1.10. This pullback might continue down to that level before the bulls buy again. They want a 2nd leg up after their strong 3 week rally.<p>The daily chart has been sideways for 3 weeks. Traders expect it to get to the June 3 low before the bulls might buy aggressively again.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a small rally early in the overnight session, but then sold off to a new low. It will be difficult for the bulls to create a strong rally until after the selloff reaches the June 3 low. The incentive just isn’t there. Why buy above that level when traders know that it is a strong magnet and they can probably buy lower?<p>Can the EURUSD collapse below the June low? That is not what typically happens. Usually there is some buying there. The bears take profits and the bulls begin to buy. If there is strong buying, the bull trend can resume. More often, the chart will spend a few days there deciding if the selloff will continue down to the next support.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways for 3 weeks. Traders are not expecting a big move up or down. Day traders are looking for scalps, but when there is a strong breakout up or down, they will hold for 30 – 50 pip swings. They know that big trends are unlikely while the daily chart is in pullback mode.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-then-wedge-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and then wedge double top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed back down and closed near the low. That late selloff was bear trend resumption in a trading range day.<p>Today was an inside day on the daily chart. It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for tomorrow. Because of its bear body, it is a weak buy signal bar. The strong 2 day rally reduces the chance of a reversal down. Therefore, the Emini has an increased chance of going sideways again tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for today. Since it had a bear body, it is a weak buy signal bar. There might be more sellers than buyers above.<p>Also, the rally was strong enough to make at least a small 2nd leg up likely. Therefore, there might be more buyers than sellers below.<p>The bulls want the 2 day rally to continue up to the gap above the February 24 high. That is a gap on both the daily and weekly charts. However, the selloff in February and March was exceptionally strong. Traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to down before there is a new all-time high.<p>There are now 2 sideways days in the middle of the June gap down. Also, there are reasons to go up and to go down. That increases the chance of another sideways day today. However, the 2 day rally was strong enough to make it slightly more likely that the Emini will go higher within a few days.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 11 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a bear day that closed near its low. It is a sell signal bar on the daily chart. Traders are wondering if the 2 day rally is going to form a lower high on the daily chart.<p>Today will probably have to test below yesterday’s low and trigger the sell signal. There is an increased chance of a big bear day because of the lower high on the daily chart. However, it is more likely that there will be buyers below yesterday’s low and that today will again be sideways. If the bulls can get today to close near its high, today will be a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>There is no strong need for a big day up or down today. This is especially true after 3 sideways weeks and 2 sideways days. Traders expect another day with at least one leg up and one leg day. It could be another trading range day. But, since today will probably trade below yesterday’s low, there is an increased chance of a bull reversal day if today trades below yesterday’s low.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-then-wedge-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-18.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and then wedge double top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is now a small head and shoulders top. Every head and shoulders top is also a double bottom bull flag and a trading range. The bears want a measured move down. That would test the breakout above the April/May trading range at around 1.10. At a minimum, they expect a test of the June 3 low. That is the bottom of the final 2 bar buy climax in the strong rally.<p>The bulls see 2 legs down over the past 2 weeks. This is therefore a High 2 bull flag. But there are 3 bear bars and a magnet below. Consequently, the EURUSD will probably go at least a little lower before again trying to break above the March high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways overnight within yesterday’s range. If the bulls can get the day to close near its high, today will be a credible buy signal bar for tomorrow. The bears however, expect a test of the June 3 low at a minimum. That would be more likely if today had a bear body. This is especially true if the bear body closed on the low.<p>With today’s small range within a 3 week range, day traders have been scalping. The odds are against a big move up or down.<p>Tomorrow is more important because it is Friday. It therefore affects the appearance of the weekly chart. The bears want the week to close below last week’s low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It quickly rallied back above yesterday’s low and entered a trading range. It straddled yesterday’s low and the 60 minute EMA all day.<p>Because today had a bull body on the daily chart, it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. The bulls want the rally on Monday and Tuesday to resume. They are hoping for a test into the gap above the February 24 high.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. If the bulls can get the week to close near the high, this week will be a good High 1 buy signal bar on the weekly chart.

That triggered a minor sell signal on the daily chart for a lower high. But the 2 day rally preceding it was strong. Therefore, yesterday was more likely a pullback from the 2 day rally than a reversal down from a lower high.<p>Since yesterday had a bull body, it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. But after 3 sideways days in the middle of a 3 week trading range, this is a minor buy signal. While the Emini will probably trigger the buy signal today, it might simply continue sideways instead of trending up strongly today.<h3>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important</h3><p>Today is Friday and therefore support and resistance on the weekly chart can be important. This is particularly true in the last hour.<p>The Emini currently is forming a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the weekly chart. If the week closes near the high of the week, it will be a stronger buy signal. Therefore, the bulls will try to get the week to close near the high of the week. That would make at least slightly higher prices likely next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open far above yesterday’s high. The daily chart is in a bull trend so traders expect higher prices.<p>But when there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the EMA. That is the average price. Traders do not like to pay a price that is far above average unless the bars are far more bullish than average.<p>Therefore, unless there are a couple big bull bars closing near their highs within the 1st few bars, traders will expect a trading range open. That happens about 80% of the time. The Emini goes sideways until it gets closer to the EMA. At that point, the bulls look to buy either a double bottom or a wedge bottom.<p>The bears want a strong bear trend from the open.

There are 2 small legs down from the June 10 top of a strong rally. The bulls hope that today will close near its high. Today would then be a High 2 bull flag buy signal bar for Monday.<p>However, when there is a reversal from a buy climax, the selloff typically reaches the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the June 3 low. Therefore, if there is a rally next week, it will probably fail around the June 16 high.<p>There would then be a small double top. That double top would be a lower high. Traders would then conclude that the 2 legs down to yesterday’s low was a complex 1st leg down. They would then look for a 2nd leg down from that small double top.<p>What would make traders conclude that yesterday was the end of the 2 legs down and that the bull trend was resuming? A breakout above the June high would do it. Also, for many traders, a rally that went 20 or 30 pips above the June 16 lower high would be enough.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market went sideways overnight around yesterday’s close. But is has rallied over the past hour. While today could continue up, all the bulls need is for today to close near its high. It would then be a good buy signal bar on the daily chart. Next week would then probably trigger the buy signal. Traders would then look for a test of the June 16 lower high.<p>Can today reverse back down? The rally is strong and the context is good for the bulls. Today should either work higher or enter a trading range.<p>This will make it difficult for the bears to make much money. Day traders are buying. If the rally evolves into a trading range, day traders will switch to buying pullbacks and looking for scalps.

That triggered a minor sell signal on the daily chart for a lower high. But the 2 day rally preceding it was strong. Therefore, yesterday was more likely a pullback from the 2 day rally than a reversal down from a lower high.<p>Since yesterday had a bull body, it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. But after 3 sideways days in the middle of a 3 week trading range, this is a minor buy signal. While the Emini will probably trigger the buy signal today, it might simply continue sideways instead of trending up strongly today.<h3>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important</h3><p>Today is Friday and therefore support and resistance on the weekly chart can be important. This is particularly true in the last hour.<p>The Emini currently is forming a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the weekly chart. If the week closes near the high of the week, it will be a stronger buy signal. Therefore, the bulls will try to get the week to close near the high of the week. That would make at least slightly higher prices likely next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 38 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open far above yesterday’s high. The daily chart is in a bull trend so traders expect higher prices.<p>But when there is a big gap up, the Emini is far above the EMA. That is the average price. Traders do not like to pay a price that is far above average unless the bars are far more bullish than average.<p>Therefore, unless there are a couple big bull bars closing near their highs within the 1st few bars, traders will expect a trading range open. That happens about 80% of the time. The Emini goes sideways until it gets closer to the EMA. At that point, the bulls look to buy either a double bottom or a wedge bottom.<p>The bears want a strong bear trend from the open. But if today is going to be a bear day, it will most likely begin from a double top or wedge top and a trading range open.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-19.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is a 50% chance that this is the start of a 15% correction. But there is also a 50% chance that the Emini will first test the gap on the weekly chart above the February 24 high.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are stuck in a 3 month tight trading range. After the huge reversal down from the extreme buy climax in March, traders think bonds will be sideways to down for several months.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market reversed down from a 2 year bear trend line. But the June rally was exceptionally strong. Traders expect the reversal to become only a 2 – 3 week pullback from that bear trend line. They will then again try to break above it.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures weekly chart:</strong><br>Weak entry above High 1 bull flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-failed-breakout-below-tight-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-20.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has failed breakout below tight trading range\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures reversed up 2 weeks ago. Last week was a High 2 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>This week triggered the buy signal by going last week’s high. But it only went 1 tick above and then traded sideways. This week was a doji bar, which is neutral.<p>Furthermore, the bond futures market is back in the middle of a 2 month tight trading range, which is also neutral. Traders are deciding whether the bond futures will resume its 20 year bull trend or pull back more. The monthly chart is telling traders that any rally from here should be minor.<h3>Pullback from most extreme buy climax in history on the monthly chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-breakout-below-ii-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-20-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart has weak breakout below ii\"></a></figure><p>The 3 month rally that started the year was the most extreme buy climax in history on the monthly chart. There was a big reversal down in late March. Traders see that as a climactic reversal in a very overbought market.<p>Sometimes a big reversal like that will begin a bear trend. Usually, however, the trend ends, at least temporarily, and the market then goes sideways. That is what is happening here.<p>The exhausted bulls at some point will buy again. We do not yet know if they will buy at the current level or much lower.<p>When there is an extreme buy climax, traders expect the pullback to test the bottom of the lest leg up. That is the January low of 152 19/32.<h3>A rally from here would be minor</h3><p>If instead a bull trend resumes now, after just a 3 month pullback on the monthly chart, traders do not believe it will reach the old high. Three bars is usually not enough time for exhausted bulls to buy again. They typically wait about 10 bars and for 2 clear legs down.<p>Also, they want the reversal to reach major support, like the January low. Any rally before then usually forms a lower high.<p>Therefore, while this week triggered a weekly buy signal, there was very little buying. Traders expect a deeper selloff lasting about a year before the bulls will be willing to buy aggressively again. Since this is a monthly chart, traders expect about a year.<p>Consequently, any rally from here will probably form a lower high. Traders expect lower prices over the next year, even if there is a 2 – 3 month rally first.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex weekly chart:</strong><br>Minor reversal down from top of 2 year bear channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-failed-breakout-above-top-of-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-20-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has failed breakout above top of bear channel\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart triggered a minor sell signal this week when this week traded below last week’s low. The bears want last week to be the start of a reversal down from the top of the 2 year bear channel.<p>They see 2 legs up from the March low. The 1st leg was the big bull bar that began on March 23. The EURUSD then went sideways for a couple months.<p>Their 2nd leg up was the 3 bar rally that ended on June 10 at the bear trend line. If the bears do get a reversal down from here, that 2nd rally will then be a 2nd Leg Bull Trap in a 2 year bear channel.<h3>Test of 2 year bear trend line, but weak sell setup</h3><p>While it is possible that last week is the start of a bear trend, the bears need stronger bear bars. Last week’s sell signal bar was a doji. That is a sign of neutrality, and not a strong reversal down. It is a weak sell signal bar.<p>This week was the entry bar, but the body was relatively small. That means that the sellers are not yet aggressive. The combination of a weak sell signal bar, an average entry bar, and a very strong rally typically results in a minor reversal. Traders expect a 2 – 5 week pullback before any other attempt to get above the March high.<p>It is important to note that there always is a bear case. What happens if the bears form 2 – 3 big bear bars closing near their lows? Traders would begin to think that the reversal down is a bear trend and not a pullback in a bull trend.<p>Also, what happens if the pullback never looks strong but falls below the April low at the bottom of the 2 month range? That again would make traders believe that the reversal down was a bear trend and not just a pullback.<h3>When will the bulls buy?</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-reversal-down-from-bear-trendline.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-20-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart reversal down from bear trendline\"></a></figure><p>Even though the reversal is probably minor, it could last several weeks. On the daily chart, the minimum target is the June 3 low of 1.1167. That is the bottom of a strong 2 day rally.<p>When there is a reversal in a strong bull trend, the 1st target is always the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the June 3 low. This week got to within 1 pip, and traders expect it to trade below next week<p>The 3 week rally broke strongly above a 2 month trading range. Breakouts often pull back to the breakout point. That is the top of that trading range, around 1.10.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Rally is losing momentum</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-reversal-bar-and-lower-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-20-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has reversal bar and lower high\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;reversed up strongly in March from below a 10 year bull trend line and a 2 year trading range. April was the buy signal bar. It was a big bull bar closing near its high. That was a strongly bullish bar.<p>May was the entry bar for the High 1 bull flag buy signal bar in April. It, too, was a big bull bar closing near its high. This was a further sign that the bulls were strong. However, the body was smaller than in April. That means that there was some loss of momentum.<h3>June’s close is important</h3><p>June is only half over. It currently is a bull bar, but the body is small and the tails are relatively big. That is a further loss of momentum.<p>But, if the bulls can get June to close near its high, there would then be 3 consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs. That is strong momentum and it would make higher prices likely. Since the Emini would be just below the all-time high, traders would expect a new high in July.<p>More likely, June will not close near its high. There is still only about a 40% chance that this year’s rally will continue up to a new high this year.<p>If June closes in the middle of its range, it will have a bull body. Traders would expect the Emini to be mostly sideways in July.<h3>The bear case is not strong</h3><p>If June closed near its low, it would be a good sell signal bar. Traders would see this year’s rally as simply a test of the all-time high. June would be forming a double top with February. This would be a sell signal.<p>However, after 3 strong months up, it would be a minor sell signal. Traders would expect a reversal down to stall about half way down.<p>Big Down in March and Big Up in June creates Big Confusion. That typically leads to a trading range. Traders would therefore expect a reversal down to stall after a month or two. Then they would look for the monthly chart to go sideways for at least a couple months after that. I have been saying all year that the Emini would be in a trading range for 2020. That is still likely.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Emini bulls want a test of the February gap on the weekly chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-20-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has weak High 1 bull flag buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is still rallying from its March V bottom. It is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. There have been only 2 pullbacks. Both were small and lasted only 2 weeks.<p>This week was a bull bar and the 2nd bar in a pullback. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for next week.<p>However, this week closed in the middle of its range. That is neutral. This week is therefore a weak buy signal bar for next week.<p>But the 3 month bull trend has been strong. Therefore, there is a 50% chance that next week still will go above this week’s high and trigger the weekly buy signal.<p>A Small Pullback Bull Trend is a sign of strong bulls. However, the weekly chart has been having more bars with tails and more reversals over the past 9 weeks. When that happens in a bull trend, it usually indicates that the rally will soon evolve into a trading range.<p>It is important to note that the bull channel is tight and there is no strong top yet. Also, there is a 40% chance that the rally will continue to a new all-time high before the rally ends and a trading range begins.<h3>February 24 Gap on the weekly chart is a magnet above</h3><p>There was a big gap down in February at the start of the pandemic. The bottom of that gap is the February 24 high of 3,238.25.<p>Last week got near that target and turned down. When a market turns down from just below an important magnet, many traders do not trust the reversal down. They are unwilling to conclude that the resistance was adequately tested. This results in fewer traders willing to sell.<p>This is the current situation. The Emini might have to rally into that gap and then reverse down before traders will conclude that the 3 month rally has ended.<p>The bulls currently have a 50% chance of this rally reaching that gap. If it gets there, the odds of a new high will go up to 50% from the current 40%.<p>When a market reaches important resistance, traders expect either a big move up or down. Will there be a breakout or a reversal? The bulls want a series of big bull bars up through the gap and a successful breakout to a new high. However, the bears will want a strong sell signal bar and a reversal down. The market often goes sideways at resistance for many bars before either rallying or reversing.<h3>Possible double top</h3><p>Patterns are rarely perfect. For example, when the Emini turned down 2 weeks ago, I called it a double top with the February high. I said that even though the June high was far below the February high. It was still a reversal down from a test of that high and therefore a double top.<p>This week went below last week’s low and therefore triggered the sell signal. However, the week closed in its middle and had a bull body. That is not how bear trends typically begin. When things are unclear, the market usually goes sideways. It has been sideways for 3 weeks. This week did nothing to change anyone’s opinion.<p>If the Emini resumes up and reverses down from around the February high again, that will be another double top. Perfect double tops are rare. The 2nd high is usually above or below the 1st high. It is often relatively far above or below. But if there is a 2nd reversal down from around a prior high, it is a double top.<p>Whether or not there is a new all-time high, traders expect some kind of double top. The February/March selloff was so strong that there should be at least a 2nd leg down back to the middle of the 2 1/2 year trading range before there is a break far above the February high.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Bull flag makes higher prices likely</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-20-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has lower high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart this week reversed up from a 5 day selloff and then reversed back down. Every other selloff since the March crash low was 3 days or less. This is a longer and deeper selloff. That is a sign that the bull trend is weakening.<p>Also, 6 of the past 8 days had bear bodies. I talked about the supply in this area. Those bear bars mean traders are using bounces to sell.<p>However, it is still a bull trend and there are important targets above. The June rally turned down from just below the gap above the February 24 high. Since that gap was huge and it began the February/March crash, it is very important. Despite the big bear bars of the past 2 weeks, there is still a 50% chance that the rally will reach into that gap before correcting.<h3>What about the February/March crash?</h3><p>The Emini fell 35% in 2 months in February and March. That was the biggest selloff since the financial crisis in 2007 – 2009.<p>Also, it was extremely quick. A bear major surprise like that has a 70% chance of a 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>In 20% of the cases, the 2nd leg down does not begin until after there is a new high. There is currently a 50% chance that this rally will enter the gap above the February 24 high of 3,238.25.<p>Additionally, there is now a 40% chance that it will continue up to a new all-time high. If the Emini makes a new high, is there still a 70% chance of about a 50% retracement of the 3 month rally? No, but the math is still good for the bears. Unless the Emini breaks far above the February high, there would still be a 60% chance of a 50% retracement of the 3 month rally. That would be about a 15% correction.<p>Remember, a surprisingly strong move up or down has a 70% chance of a 2nd leg. The bears are still waiting for their 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>But the 3 month rally was surprisingly strongly up. Consequently, the bulls will buy the 2nd leg down, and that buying will create their 2nd leg up. The 15% down and then a 2nd leg up will probably take many months. Traders expect the Emini to continue its 2.5 year trading range for the remainder of the year.<h3 id=\"downside-targets-inc-bo-points-and-prior-hl\">Downside targets include breakout points and prior higher lows</h3><p>Once the bears take control, how far down will the Emini fall? Traders will look for a pullback to a breakout point. For example, the April/May double top is 2,936.75.<p>Another breakout point is the March 31 high of 2,619.00. There was a pullback on April 21, but its low was far above the March 31 high. At this point, there is a 40% chance that the selloff will close that gap.<p>Traders also look at prior higher lows as support. The May 14 low around 2,750 was the start of a climactic 3 week rally. There is a 60% chance that a reversal down will get there. Traders expect a reversal to test the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the May 14 low.<h3>Traders also look at percentage retracements</h3><p>Next, traders think about percentages. Normally, they would be looking for a 10% pullback from the high. But the legs down and up were huge. Therefore, traders expect the pullback to be bigger than average. That is why I have been saying about 15%. Based on the current top of the rally, a 15% pullback is below 2,750.<p>A 10% pullback from the high is a correction. A 20% selloff is a bear market. Twenty percent down is 2,697. I have said several times that the Emini might get stuck between a 10% and 20% pullback for many months. That means it would test 2,700.<p>What about Fibonacci levels? Some institutions pay attention to them. There are so many to choose from that every one of them will be very close to the other targets I just mentioned. I therefore ignore them.<h3>Will the Emini fall to a new low this year?</h3><p>No, not after such a strong rally. There is only a 30% chance that the Emini will reach the March low before there is a strong break to a new high.<p>I know that 30% sounds pretty high, and it is. But the Emini has been in a trading range for 2.5 years. When a market is in a trading range, it is neutral. This is true even though it can have extremely strong legs up and down, like this one has had.<p>Neutral means that the bulls and bears are balanced. They alternate control. There are more sellers near the top and more buyers near the bottom.<p>The result is that the probability for just about anything will be between 40 and 60%. However, as long as it is in the trading range, there will always be at least a 30% chance of a new high and of a new low.<h3>What will the Emini do next week?</h3><p>The bears want a lower high major trend reversal down and then a 15% correction. Friday’s big outside down bar closing on its low gave them a 50% chance of succeeding.<p>However, don’t forget the 2 big bull days this week. The bulls are just as strong as the bears. There is therefore a 50% chance that the Emini will soon test above the February 24 high and into the gap on the daily and weekly charts.<p>The Emini is in the middle of a 3 week trading range. It could stay here for a couple more weeks before deciding on either continuing up to the gap or reversing down.<p>It probably will not stay sideways very long. We are entering a seasonal bullish window from around June 26 to July 5. That is the end of the quarter when there is often window dressing. Firms want to buy was has been doing well so that their quarterly report will show that they own the best stocks.<p>Also, there is usually some euphoria heading into the July 4th holiday. Finally, the Emini has been in a bull trend for 3 months. Unless the bears get follow-through selling next week, traders will expect a test of the February 24 gap.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is a sell signal bar for today.<p>There is now a small double top and a lower high major trend reversal. The bears have a 50% chance of this being the start of a 15% correction. There is still a 50% chance of a rally to the gap above the February 24 high.<p>But the bears need 2 or 3 big bear bars closing near their lows this week. If instead there are bull bars early this week, the bulls will again try to get above the February 24 high. That is the bottom of the gap on the weekly chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 19 points in the Globex session. After Friday’s midday double top bear flag, the bears want a lower high. They then want a strong break below Friday’s low. However, the Emini has been sideways for 4 days and in the middle of a 3 week range. It is equally likely that Friday is a bear trap and this week will go sideways to up.<p>Because Friday was a sell climax, there is an increased chance of exhausted bears. That means the Emini will probably spend at least a couple hours going sideways to up early today. The bulls want a breakout above Friday’s double top at around 3105. They would then look for a rally to the top of the 4 day tight trading range.<p>The bears want a big break below Friday’s low. They then would look look for a test of the 3,000 Big Round Number.<p>What is most likely? The Emini has been in a tight range for 4 days within a 3 week range. Reversals are more common than breakouts. Day traders expect the sideways trading to continue.<p>But the weekly chart might be forming a double top with the February high. Traders know that a big move up or down can begin on any day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-22.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

A trading range always has a reasonable buy and sell signal. The bears have a small head and shoulders top. It is a lower high and at a 2 year bear trend line. The bulls now have a double bottom with the June 3 buy climax low.<p>When the market is in a trading range, it is neutral. There is about a 50% chance of a bull breakout and measured move up. Also, there is a 50% chance of a bear breakout and measured move down.<p>Since the EURUSD is now at the bottom of the range, traders expect it to reverse up. But there are 4 consecutive bear bars. A reversal up at this point probably will not break above the June high. However, it might test the June 16 lower high and form a small double top. The bears would try again to break below the bottom of the range.<p>The EURUSD is trying to reverse up from a double bottom with the June 3 low and a micro double bottom with Friday’s low. Both lows got to within a pip of the June 3 low. I have been saying for 2 weeks that the EURUSD would get here and then decide whether to fall to the next support at the May 1 high or resume up to the March 9 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market is testing the support of the June 3 buy climax low. Today tested Friday’s low and reversed up. The bulls want today to be a buy signal bar on the daily chart. They therefore want today to close near its high. Day traders will buy 20 pip selloffs expecting at least a minor rally from the double bottom with the June 3 low.<p>Traders know that every pip matters. It is not a coincidence that both today and Friday reversed up from a pip above the June 3 low. I have been saying for 2 weeks that the EURUSD would get here.<p>The bears want today to fall at least a few pips below that low. Traders would then begin to believe that the double bottom will fail. That would increase the chance of a move down to the May 1 high of 1.1018 at the top of the April/May trading range.<p>The bears want the bear breakout. Consequently, they will sell rallies today, hoping for a break below Friday’s low early this week.<p>At the moment, the day’s range and the overnight bars are small. That makes a big trend day unlikely. Day traders will continue to scalp for 10 pips today unless there is a surprisingly big move up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-channel-and-ioi-buy-flag-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-22-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was therefore an inside day after an outside day.<p>This is an ioi Breakout Mode pattern. Yesterday is now both a sell and buy signal bar for today. The Emini is in a 5 day tight trading range in the middle of a 4 week trading range. Traders see it a neutral. A neutral market always has both a bull and sell setup.<p>The bulls want a test into the weekly gap above the February 24 high. The bears, however, are hoping that last week’s lower high major trend reversal on the daily chart is the start of a 15% correction.<h3>Strong bull trend favors higher prices</h3><p>Because the daily chart is in a bull trend and yesterday closed near its high, the odds favor a rally up to the gap at 3238.25. Also, last week was a buy signal bar in the weekly chart. The weekly chart is still in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Furthermore, the Emini enters a seasonally bullish window on June 26 through July 5. This is because there is often end of the quarter window dressing and pre-holiday euphoria.<p>What is most likely today? Traders expect the Emini to go above yesterday’s high and trigger the buy signal. It might also go above last week’s high and trigger the weekly buy signal. The bulls want a strong bull trend day and a breakout far above that high.<p>However, the Emini has not yet broken above its 5 day tight trading range. The bears will try to get a strong reversal down now that the Emini is at the top. They still have a lower high major trend reversal on the daily chart. But if they are unable to prevent a strong bull day today, traders will expect a test above the February 24 high within a week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 32 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap far above yesterday’s high. That would trigger the ioi buy signal.<p>Last week is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the weekly chart. If today goes above its high of 3144.00, the Emini would trigger the weekly buy signal. The bulls want this rally to enter the gap down on the weekly chart above the February 24 high.<p>However, it would still be at the top of the 5 day tight trading range. The bears will try for a reversal down. The top of the trading range is also last week’s high. But the bull trend on the daily and weekly charts make the bull breakout more likely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bull-channel-and-ioi-buy-flag-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-23.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel and ioi buy flag buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-double-bottom-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-23-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double bottom bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is reversing up from a double bottom with the June 3 buy climax low. I have been saying that it would pull back there for the past 2 weeks.<p>The bulls hope the 2 day rally will lead to a breakout above the 3 week trading range. A measured move up would create a breakout above the March high.<p>If the bulls get a couple closes above that high, traders will conclude that the 2 year bear trend is over. They would see the weekly and monthly charts as then being in a trading range and possibly an early bull trend.<h3>Trading range so Breakout Mode</h3><p>It is important to note that the EURUSD daily chart is still in a 3 week trading range. The June 16 lower high is a magnet above.<p>The bears will try to get a reversal down from there. That would be a double top bear flag in what they hope is the start of a bear trend. At a minimum, they want a break below the June 3/June 19 double bottom and then a measured move down to the May 1 high.<p>The 3 week late May rally was exceptionally strong, as was the March rally. Even though the EURUSD is still in a 3 week trading range, the probability still favors a bull breakout.<p>Traders will find out this week if the breakout is beginning this week or if there will be a test of the May 1 high first. If today and tomorrow are bull days closing on their highs and if tomorrow closes above the June 16 high, the bulls will probably get their break above the June high within a week or so.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying overnight is a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Day traders have only been buying. Because the pullbacks have been small, the bears have been unable to make money. That is a sign of a strong bull trend.<p>The day’s range is almost as big as that of most recent days. Therefore, there might not be much left to today’s rally.<p>The bulls want it to continue up to above the June 16 lower high. That is about 20 pips above the overnight high.<p>But this rally has had 3 legs up, which is a wedge rally. That is a type of buy climax and it typically attracts profit taking.<p>If the bulls begin to take profits, the pullbacks will no longer be small. The bull trend will evolve into a trading range.<p>The bears will start to sell rallies after they see a 30 pip pullback. However, unless there is a 40 – 50 pip selloff, many day traders will continue to only look to buy.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-wedge-top-and-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and lower high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then poked above last week’s high and triggered a weekly High 1 buy signal.<p>However, it reversed down and closed near the low of the day. It is therefore a sell signal bar on the daily chart for a lower high major trend reversal.<p>The bears are hoping that this is the start of a 50% retracement of the 3 month rally. However, the bulls hope that today’s selloff is just a pullback from the break above last week’s high.<p>The gap on the weekly chart above the February 24 high is still an important magnet above. Also, the Emini has been stuck in a tight trading range for 6 days. Traders believe a test of the February 24 high is as likely as a reversal down. They are waiting for a strong breakout above or below the 6 day range.<p>This is the end of the quarter. June 26 to July 5 is typically a bullish window. But many institutions have huge profits this quarter. We don’t yet know how many will take profits before the end of the quarter. That could totally erase the bullish seasonal tendency.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, it reversed down from a wedge top after poking above last week’s high. It closed near the low of the day. Yesterday is therefore a sell signal bar for today. There is a small triple top and a lower high major trend reversal going into the end of the 2nd quarter.<p>The bears want this to be the start of a selloff. However, the bulls hope that yesterday is just a pullback from above last week’s high.<p>Traders are deciding if the Emini will reach the gap on the weekly chart above the February 24 high before correcting. Traders expect a 15% correction at some point this summer. It might have begun with yesterday’s failed breakout above last week’s high.<p>There is a strong bull trend on the daily and weekly charts. Also, the gap above the February 24 high is a strong magnet. Traders also know that there is a seasonal bullish bias going into the 4th of July. However, the institutions have made huge profits in the 2nd quarter. Many may take profits before the quarter ends. Traders do not yet know which of these factors will lead to the a successful breakout.<p>Spending time thinking about things like this is a distraction for traders. It is better to just watch the charts and trade what you see.<h3>Breakout Mode</h3><p>The Emini is still in a 6 day tight trading range. It is therefore in Breakout Mode. Traders believe that the probability of a bull breakout is the same as for a bear breakout.<p>There should be a breakout of the 6 day trading range before the end of the month next week. Traders are ready for a breakout in either direction. Furthermore, they know that the 1st breakout fails 50% of the time.<p>The daily and weekly charts are in bull trends. But most institutions have huge profits this quarter. If many take profits going into the end of the quarter, that profit taking could be the start of a 15% correction over the next month or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 20 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap down today. Since yesterday gapped up, yesterday would then be a 1 day island top.<p>However, the most important chart pattern at the moment on the daily chart is the 7 day tight trading range. Traders have been selling near the top, buying near the bottom, and expect every day to reverse the prior day.<p>Today will open in the middle of the range. That location increases the chance of a more neutral day. That means traders expect trading range price action today.<p>Because the daily ranges have been big, there will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down. However, traders will expect any trend lasting 2 – 3 hours to either go sideways or reverse.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-wedge-top-and-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-24.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and lower high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is always both a reasonable buy and sell signal. The bulls see today as a pullback from a rally from a double bottom bull flag.<p>However, today so far has a bear body and there is now a double top with the June 16 lower high. The bears hope a bear trend began on June 10. They therefore see yesterday as forming a double top bear flag.<p>The chart is in Breakout Mode. That means the bulls and bears are balanced. Traders believe that the probability for a breakout up or down is about 50%. Otherwise, the EURUSD would not be going sideways like this.<p>There are always going to be things that change the probability a little in favor or the bulls or bears for a day or so. However, traders know that the market it neutral. They tend to sell near the top of the 4 week range, buy near the bottom, and take quick profits.<p>The breakout can come at any time. But traders know that the 1st breakout up or down will fail and reverse 50% of the time.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight was in a trading range that had a downside breakout. It has been in a lower range for several hours. This is a Trending Trading Range Day, which is a weak bear trend.<p>The EURUSD has been in a trading range all day except during the brief bear breakout. Therefore traders have been trading it like a trading range. They are looking to buy reversals up from the bottom, sell reversals down from the top, and scalp for 10 – 20 pips. Unless there is a breakout up or down, they will continue to scalp all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, it reversed down from a wedge top after poking above last week’s high. It closed near the low of the day. Yesterday is therefore a sell signal bar for today. There is a small triple top and a lower high major trend reversal going into the end of the 2nd quarter.<p>The bears want this to be the start of a selloff. However, the bulls hope that yesterday is just a pullback from above last week’s high.<p>Traders are deciding if the Emini will reach the gap on the weekly chart above the February 24 high before correcting. Traders expect a 15% correction at some point this summer. It might have begun with yesterday’s failed breakout above last week’s high.<p>There is a strong bull trend on the daily and weekly charts. Also, the gap above the February 24 high is a strong magnet. Traders also know that there is a seasonal bullish bias going into the 4th of July. However, the institutions have made huge profits in the 2nd quarter. Many may take profits before the quarter ends. Traders do not yet know which of these factors will lead to the a successful breakout.<p>Spending time thinking about things like this is a distraction for traders. It is better to just watch the charts and trade what you see.<h3>Breakout Mode</h3><p>The Emini is still in a 6 day tight trading range. It is therefore in Breakout Mode. Traders believe that the probability of a bull breakout is the same as for a bear breakout.<p>There should be a breakout of the 6 day trading range before the end of the month next week. Traders are ready for a breakout in either direction. Furthermore, they know that the 1st breakout fails 50% of the time.<p>The daily and weekly charts are in bull trends. But most institutions have huge profits this quarter. If many take profits going into the end of the quarter, that profit taking could be the start of a 15% correction over the next month or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 20 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap down today. Since yesterday gapped up, yesterday would then be a 1 day island top.<p>However, the most important chart pattern at the moment on the daily chart is the 7 day tight trading range. Traders have been selling near the top, buying near the bottom, and expect every day to reverse the prior day.<p>Today will open in the middle of the range. That location increases the chance of a more neutral day. That means traders expect trading range price action today.<p>Because the daily ranges have been big, there will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down. However, traders will expect any trend lasting 2 – 3 hours to either go sideways or reverse.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-wedge-top-and-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-24.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and lower high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is always both a reasonable buy and sell signal. The bulls see today as a pullback from a rally from a double bottom bull flag.<p>However, today so far has a bear body and there is now a double top with the June 16 lower high. The bears hope a bear trend began on June 10. They therefore see yesterday as forming a double top bear flag.<p>The chart is in Breakout Mode. That means the bulls and bears are balanced. Traders believe that the probability for a breakout up or down is about 50%. Otherwise, the EURUSD would not be going sideways like this.<p>There are always going to be things that change the probability a little in favor or the bulls or bears for a day or so. However, traders know that the market it neutral. They tend to sell near the top of the 4 week range, buy near the bottom, and take quick profits.<p>The breakout can come at any time. But traders know that the 1st breakout up or down will fail and reverse 50% of the time.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market overnight was in a trading range that had a downside breakout. It has been in a lower range for several hours. This is a Trending Trading Range Day, which is a weak bear trend.<p>The EURUSD has been in a trading range all day except during the brief bear breakout. Therefore traders have been trading it like a trading range. They are looking to buy reversals up from the bottom, sell reversals down from the top, and scalp for 10 – 20 pips.

On the daily chart, it triggered a lower high major trend reversal sell signal.<p>Today is important. If today has a bear body on the daily chart, traders would see that as confirmation of yesterday’s bear breakout below the 7 day tight trading range. They then will look for lower prices. Also, they will begin to believe that the 15% correction of the 3 month rally has begun.<p>Alternatively, if today closes on its high, they will conclude that the bear breakout failed. They will again look for a test of the gap on the weekly chart above the February 24 high.<p>It is important to note that the stock market has a bullish bias from June 26 to July 5. We enter that window tomorrow. Therefore, there might not be too much left to the selling.<h3>Monthly support and resistance</h3><p>There are only 4 trading days left in June. Yesterday dipped back below the open of the month. That might be a key price for the remainder of the month. If June closes below its open, it will have a bear body. Traders will see June as a sell signal bar on the monthly chart. This is especially true if June closes on its low.<p>Yesterday also spent 5 hours oscillating around a 10% pullback from the all-time high. When the Emini is below 3034.80, it is in correction territory. It closed just above that price yesterday.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 29 points in the Globex session. It might gap below yesterday’s low.<p>However, there is still a 50% chance that the 2 day selloff is only a bear leg in a trading range. Yesterday broke below the 7 day tight trading range, but the Emini is still in a 4 week trading range. The bulls might be waiting for a test of the June 15 low before buying aggressively again.<p>Today’s should tell traders if yesterday’s breakout will succeed and lead to a test of the June 15 low. If today is a bear trend day, traders will look for a test of the June 15 low next week.<p>But if today rallies, traders will expect follow-through buying over the next several days and a break above the 7 day tight trading range.<p>Yesterday crashed, but then entered a trading range for several hours. A trading range late in a bear trend is often the Final Bear Flag. That increases the chance that the Emini today will work back up into yesterday’s trading range at some point today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-25.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

I said last week that the rally from the double bottom with the June 3 low would probably reverse down from a double top with the June 16 high. Then, traders would decide if there would be a test down to the breakout point, which is the May 1 high.<p>A pullback to a breakout point happens more often than not. Consequently, while the past 3 weeks are still forming a bull flag, there is a slightly higher probability of a test down to the 1.10 area before another attempt to go above the March high.<p>But if today or tomorrow reverses up strongly from the June 3/June 19 double bottom, the odds will again shift in favor of the bulls.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been selling off in a tight bear channel overnight. Day traders are only selling because the bulls have been unable to make money.<p>The selloff is getting near the June 3/June 19 double bottom. This should make bears begin to take profits. If they do, the overnight bear trend will evolve into a trading range. Day traders will switch to selling rallies instead of at the market. Also, if there is a 20 – 30 pip bounce, day traders will begin to buy reversals up from the low for scalps.<p>A Small Pullback Bear Trend like this does not usually immediately reverse into a bull trend. Consequently, the best the bulls can get over the next few hours is a trading range. After a couple hours of sideways trading, they will have a 30% chance of a bull trend reversal into the end of the session.<p>While the overnight bear trend has been strong, the EURUSD is now near the bottom of a 3 week trading range. It is probably going evolve into a trading range within an hour or so.<p>The bears hope that it will continue down far below the June double bottom. However, the lack of big consecutive bear bars means the momentum down is not very strong. Therefore, a trading range is currently more likely than a strong breakout below the double bottom today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-sell-climax-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a double bottom higher low major trend reversal. The Emini was sideways for several hours and the bulls got strong trend resumption up in the final hour.<p>Today is a bull day and a buy signal bar on the daily chart. There is a failed breakout below the 7 day tight trading range. Also, the Emini is entering a seasonally bullish window.

I said last week that the rally from the double bottom with the June 3 low would probably reverse down from a double top with the June 16 high. Then, traders would decide if there would be a test down to the breakout point, which is the May 1 high.<p>A pullback to a breakout point happens more often than not. Consequently, while the past 3 weeks are still forming a bull flag, there is a slightly higher probability of a test down to the 1.10 area before another attempt to go above the March high.<p>But if today or tomorrow reverses up strongly from the June 3/June 19 double bottom, the odds will again shift in favor of the bulls.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been selling off in a tight bear channel overnight. Day traders are only selling because the bulls have been unable to make money.<p>The selloff is getting near the June 3/June 19 double bottom. This should make bears begin to take profits. If they do, the overnight bear trend will evolve into a trading range. Day traders will switch to selling rallies instead of at the market. Also, if there is a 20 – 30 pip bounce, day traders will begin to buy reversals up from the low for scalps.<p>A Small Pullback Bear Trend like this does not usually immediately reverse into a bull trend. Consequently, the best the bulls can get over the next few hours is a trading range. After a couple hours of sideways trading, they will have a 30% chance of a bull trend reversal into the end of the session.<p>While the overnight bear trend has been strong, the EURUSD is now near the bottom of a 3 week trading range. It is probably going evolve into a trading range within an hour or so.<p>The bears hope that it will continue down far below the June double bottom. However, the lack of big consecutive bear bars means the momentum down is not very strong. Therefore, a trading range is currently more likely than a strong breakout below the double bottom today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-sell-climax-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a double bottom higher low major trend reversal. The Emini was sideways for several hours and the bulls got strong trend resumption up in the final hour.<p>Today is a bull day and a buy signal bar on the daily chart. There is a failed breakout below the 7 day tight trading range. Also, the Emini is entering a seasonally bullish window. It will probably trade higher tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday is a buy signal bar for today. The Emini will probably go above yesterday’s high to trigger the buy signal today.<p>That gap above the February high is a magnet above. With the stock market in a seasonally bullish window from today through July 5, the bulls have a good chance of reaching their goal.<p>Can yesterday be just a pullback from Wednesday’s selloff? Can today resume Wednesday’s selloff? Not likely. Strong bears would not typically allow the follow-through bar after a bear breakout to be a bull bar closing near its high.<h3>Emini paying attention to weekly support and resistance</h3><p>The Emini tends to rally from around June 26 to July 5. Also, yesterday was a good buy signal bar on the daily chart. There is an increased chance of a bull trend day today.<p>The bulls want today to end the week above last week’s high. Remember, last week was a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the weekly chart. This week is the entry bar. So far, this week is a doji bar, which is neutral and disappointing for the bulls.<p>The high of the week is 80 points above the current price. That is probably too far up for the bulls to get there today. They might decide to not even try. If that is the case, their goal would then be to simple have the week close above the open. If the weekly candlestick is going to be a doji, they will try to have it have a bull body.<p>The bears want the week to close near its low. This week would then be a sell signal bar for a Low 2 top on the weekly chart.<p>But their problem is the same as the bulls. Their target, the low of the week, might be too far for them to reach it today. If they decide that it is not worth trying, they instead will simply try to get a bear body on the weekly chart. That means they will try to get today to close below the open of the week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 5 points in the Globex session. It rallied at the end of the day yesterday to just 1 tick above the open of the week and pulled back. It barely got above the bottom of the 7 day tight trading range and the 60 minute EMA. It will probably open around these magnets today.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. The Emini has been sideways for 2 days around the open of the week, the bottom of the 7 day tight trading range, and the open of the month. So far, this week is a doji bar on the weekly chart. Also, it is in the middle of a 4 week tight trading range. This is a neutral market.<p>The bulls want the Emini to go above yesterday’s high to trigger the buy signal on the daily chart. But in a neutral market, most attempts to begin trends disappoint traders. Therefore there might be more sellers than buyers above yesterday’s high.<p>Also, with yesterday’s strong rally stopping 1 tick above the open of the week, traders see that price as very important. There is therefore an increased chance of a trading range today. But the daily ranges have been big and the legs up and down have been big as well. Even if today is a trading range day, there will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down.<p>Finally, if the Emini is within 20 points of the open of the week in the final hour, traders should watch for a move to the open of the week at the end of the day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-sell-climax-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-26.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is a bull flag, but which is good for the bulls. But it is a lower high in a 2 year bear channel. That is good for the bears.<p>Every trading range has both a buy and sell signal. This one has both a double top and a double bottom. Traders see this as neutral.<p>Since the last time that things were clear was during the strong rally to the June high, the bulls have a slightly higher probability of a bull breakout. However, breakouts often test breakout points. Consequently, there might be a pullback to the May 1 high before there is a break above the 3 week range.<h3>No sustained strong movement up or down</h3><p>The bulls see the past 2 days as a pullback from the June 3 and June 19 double bottom at the EMA. They need a good buy signal bar today to make traders eager to buy on Monday. If today closes on its high, it would be a buy signal bar for Monday.<p>The bears want a 3rd consecutive bears day, especially one closing on its low. That would increase the chance of a bear breakout next week.<p>What is most likely? More sideways trading today. So far, today is a small day within yesterday’s range. Additionally, it is trading just about where it opened. It is a doji bar, which is neutral. Since it is within a 3 week trading range, the environment is neutral as well. Traders will probably have to wait until next week to see if either the bulls or bears can generate strong trend bars.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 30 pip trading range overnight. Day traders are scalping for 10 – 20 pips.<p>While it is always possible that there could be a breakout and a trend, it is more likely that today will be simply trying to set the tone for next week. All the bulls need is for today to close near its high. Traders would then see it as a good buy signal bar for next week.<p>The bears want today to close on its low and below yesterday’s low. That would increase the chance of a bear break below the 3 week range next week.<p>However, the EURUSD is near the bottom of the range. Legs in trading ranges are more likely to reverse than break out. Therefore, today will probably not close on its low. But unless the bulls get a strong rally, the bears will continue to sell near the high of the day for scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It is therefore a sell signal bar on the weekly chart for a Low 2 top.<p>However, the monthly chart is more important at the moment. Tuesday is the final day of the month. The bulls want a 3rd consecutive bull bar. They therefore want June to close above its open. The bears not only want a bear bar, they want June to close on its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices in July.<p>With the uncertainty of the 3 week trading range and the June close, traders will be open to anything on Monday.

But, it formed a strong sell signal bar on the weekly chart. If the bears get a big selloff next week, the Emini will probably work down below 2700 this summer.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market has a High 1 bull flag on the monthly chart, but it is in a tight trading range. July should trade at least a little higher.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market rally has stalled at the 2 year bear trend line for 4 weeks. It might have to test down to the breakout point just above 1.10.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures monthly chart:</strong><br>High 1 bull flag after failed breakout below ii</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-High-1-bull-flag-after-failed-breakout-below-ii-in-buy-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-27.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart has High 1 bull flag after failed breakout below ii in buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures formed consecutive inside bars on the monthly chart in April and May. This is an ii pattern (inside-inside). April’s high was below the March high and its low was above the March low. May was then inside of April’s range.<p>This is a Breakout Mode pattern. That means it is equally likely to lead to a rally or a selloff. Also, the 1st breakout fails half of the time.<p>The bond futures sold off below the ii pattern in June. However, it is now back at the high of the month. If June closes around here, traders will conclude that the bear breakout failed. Furthermore, June with be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the monthly chart.<p>The bulls hope for a new high. But even if they get one, it will probably be brief. The bond market should work down to the November 2019 low within a couple years. That is the bottom of the most recent buy climax and is a magnet once there is a reversal down.<h3>Reversal down from extreme buy climax</h3><p>The most important feature on the monthly chart is the January to March buy climax. That was the most extreme buy climax in the history of the bond market. March reversed down and closed in the middle of its range.<p>After a reversal from a buy climax, traders look for a pause. Exhausted bulls take profits and then typically wait for about 10 bars before buying again. They want to give the bears a couple opportunities to reverse the trend before buying aggressively again.<p>Sometimes, however, there is one more buy climax before the reversal down begins. That is what traders are now deciding. Will this month lead to one more new high and then a reversal down? Or, will there be a brief rally to a lower high for a couple months and then a swing down to the November 2019 buy climax low?<p>We will find out this summer. If June closes near its high on Tuesday, it will make higher prices likely in July.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex weekly chart:</strong><br>Stalling for 4 weeks at bear trend line</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-is-pulling-back-from-breakout-above-triange-and-test-of-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-27-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart is pulling back from breakout above triangle and test of bear trend line\"></a><figcaption>680</figcaption></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart has been sideways for 4 weeks after a strong 3 week rally. The bulls hope this is a bull flag. But each of the bars has a prominent tail on top. All 4 bars tested the 2 year bear trend line and reversed down. This is not how an impending breakout typically looks.<p>Furthermore, when there is a strong breakout, traders expect a pullback to test the breakout point. That is the May 1 high of 1.1018. Therefore, despite the strong rally, the EURUSD will probably pull back for a week or two to test the breakout point and the 20 week EMA.<p>Can the rally resume and break strongly above the March high without a pullback? Given the appearance of the past 4 weeks, a pullback is more likely.<h3>EURUSD might close above EMA on monthly chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-breakout-above-ioi-in-Triangle-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-27-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has weak breakout above ioi in Triangle\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD monthly Forex chart tested the March high and is forming a lower high in June. It is not near the 12 year bear trend line.<p>There are still 2 trading days remaining in June. So far, the month has a small bull body.<p>More importantly, its close is currently above the 20 month EMA. If June closes above the EMA, it would be the 1st time in over 2 years. Also, there would be consecutive bull bars on the monthly chart for the 1st time since the current bear channel began in February 2018.<h3>2 year bear channel is weakening</h3><p>June’s high is below the March high. The monthly chart is still in a bear channel. But these are significant signs that the price action is changing. The bulls are getting stronger and the bears are getting weaker.<p>Because the monthly chart is still forming lower highs and lows, it is in a bear trend. However, it has been sideways for about a year. It is therefore also in a trading range.<p>A bear trend often transitions into a trading range before reversing up into a bull trend. What do traders need to conclude that the monthly chart has become a bull trend? A couple consecutive bull bars closing near their highs and above the March high would be enough.<h3>Spike and Channel bear trend usually evolves into a trading range</h3><p>Even if they get their strong breakout above the March high, the bear trend was a Spike and Channel pattern. It spiked down for a couple months in April and May 2018 and then entered a bear channel.<p>When the bulls get a break above the bear channel, the rally usually tests the start of the channel. That is the top of the 1st pullback from the spike down. Here, it is the September 2018 high of 1.1816. Then, there usually is a reversal down and that leads to a trading range.<p>Consequently, even if the bulls get a bull trend over the next several months, it will probably just be a bull leg in what will become a bigger trading range. That trading range could last a couple more years.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>June might become minor sell signal bar</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-bear-reversal-sell-signal-bar-in-June.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-27-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has bear reversal sell signal bar in June\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years. The Emini has rallied for 3 months, but the bodies have been shrinking. This represents a loss of momentum as the rally approaches the resistance at the top of the range.<p>When a market is in a trading range, traders expect reversals near the top and bottom. The Emini is now near the top. Traders are looking for a pullback to the middle of the range.<p>If June closes below the open of the month on Tuesday, it will have a bear body. It would then be a bear sell signal bar for July. That would make lower prices likely in July.<p>But the 3 month rally was surprisingly strong. Consequently, traders will look to buy in the middle of the range after a 1 – 2 month pullback. They do not believe that a reversal from here will continue to below the March low.<h3>End of month and end of quarter</h3><p>Remember, there are still 2 trading days remaining in June. The June candlestick could look very different once it closes.<p>It is important to note that there is a bullish tendency at the end of quarters and ahead of holidays. Both of these factors are in effect at the end of June.<p>If June were to rally in the final 2 days and close above the midpoint of the month, that would increase the chance of higher prices in July. More traders would suspect that the rally will continue up to a new all-time high.<p>There is another important consideration. Most institutions have huge profits this quarter. Many will want to take some profits before the end of the quarter. If enough do, the Emini could fall dramatically in the final 2 trading days.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Low 2 sell signal near top of 2 1/2 year trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-Low-2-top-sell-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-27-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart has Low 2 top sell signal bar\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been sideways for 4 weeks. This follows a strong 3 month rally is in a tight bull channel.<p>Many bars over the past 10 weeks have had prominent tails. That is trading range price action. It typically eventually leads to a trading range. The past 4 weeks of sideways trading might be the start of the trading range. Traders need more information before they conclude that the 3 month bull leg has ended and a bear leg has begun.<p>There have been 2 legs up in the 3 month rally. This week went above last week’s high and triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal. But instead of continuing up for a 3rd leg, the Emini immediately reversed down.<p>The week closed near the low. It is therefore a Low 2 top (micro double top with the high from 2 weeks ago) sell signal bar for next week. Traders are wondering if the bulls are exhausted. If they are, traders will expect a retracement of about half of the rally.<p>Traders know that trends resist change. Also, the gap above the February 24 high is an important magnet above. That was the start of the pandemic crash. The Emini is near enough to make traders think that the rally still could get there before there is a reversal down.<h3>Traders deciding if the the rally will continue or reverse down</h3><p>The 4 weeks of sideways trading is a reflection of these mixed signals. It is in Breakout Mode. The bulls want a rally from here to continue up to a new high. At a minimum, they want a test into the February gap.<p>However, the bears want a double top with the February high. A reversal down from here or from the gap would be a lower high double top. They expect a retracement of about half of the 3 month rally.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Weak reversal down from lower high major trend reversal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-27-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has wedge lower high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed down strongly on June 11. Since then, it has then been in a tight trading range. The bulls hope that the trading range is just a pause in the 3 month rally. They see the trading range as a double bottom bull flag. They want the rally to resume and test the gap above the February 24 high. Then, they want it to continue up to a new high.<p>Friday’s selloff stopped at the support of the 200 day MA and the 3,000 Big Round Number. It closed just below 10% down from the all-time high. The Emini is therefore back in correction territory. These 3 prices are magnets and could be support next week.<p>Every trading range has both a credible buy and sell signal. The bears see a small wedge rally a lower high after a reversal down from a buy climax. This week’s reversal down is from a lower high major trend reversal. There is also a double or triple top in the tight trading range. But the Emini is still in the trading range.<p>So, what is more likely, a bull or bear breakout? The Emini would not be in a tight range if either side had a significant advantage. It is neutral. When that is the case, it becomes bullish for a day or two and then bearish for a day or two. Most most breakout attempts will fail.<p>Everyone knows there will be a breakout within a couple weeks. But traders also know that the 1st breakout up or down will fail. They need to see a couple consecutive closes above or below the range to conclude that the breakout is successful.<h3>The bulls want a new all-time high</h3><p>How can the market rally when 10% of the country is out of work and consumer spending is way down? There is a simple fundamental reason and I have mentioned it many times. The Fed said that it would “print infinite money” to protect the economy.<p>Traders have concluded that there is a floor under the market. If it can’t go down, maybe it can only go up. Institutions are buying an overbought market with mediocre earnings during a pandemic when consumer spending is greatly reduced because they believe that the one fundamental fact is more important.<p>From a technical perspective, the Emini has been in a trading range for 2 1/2 years. This rally is simply a bull leg in that range. In a trading range, legs go up and legs go down. This is just an up leg. It is strong, but so was the down leg. No matter, the Emini is still in a trading range. A rally made sense when the Emini broke below the bottom of the range in March. A selloff makes sense now that the Emini is back near the top of the range.<h3>How far can a bull breakout go?</h3><p>The minimum goal for the bulls is a test into the gap above the February 24 high. That gap was very big and it was the start of a 35% selloff. It is therefore very important. The Emini is near enough to make many traders believe that the Emini could get there.<p>If it gets there, the rally will be a test. The bears sold strongly at that price in March. Will they sell again? Or, will the bulls be strong enough to take the market to far above the old high?<p>There is a 50% chance that the Emini will test into the gap and a 40% chance of a new high. Furthermore, there is a 30% chance of a strong breakout to far above the old high.<p>But there is a lot of supply around the old high. If the Emini gets a couple closes below the June 15 low, the odds will be that the 15% correction is underway.<p>Most corrections are not clear until they are about half over. Two closes below the June low would be more than a 10% selloff from the June high. If that is half of the correction, the 2nd half would take the market down to around 2600. That has been my target for since April.<h3>What does “seasonally bullish” mean?</h3><p>One of the reasons why I do not pay too much attention to trades based on the calendar is that it is impossible to make money trading them. The margin is small, at best, and the stop usually has to be far relative to the expected gain.<p>For example, when I say that there is a bullish window from June 26 to July 5, what am I saying? Does it mean that the stock market will rally strong from the 1st day of the window until the final day? No, it means that when I tested this many years ago, I noticed that 75% of the time, the close of July 5 was was above the close of June 25. It only has to go up 1 tick during that period to qualify.<p>It is important to understand that if you look at a yearly chart where each bar is one year, the longest pullback in history was only 3 bars. That occurred in the Great Depression. Even a 2 bar (year) pullback is rare.<p>The stock market has been in a bull trend forever. That means the probability of any day being higher than any prior day is more than 50%. In fact, in any 5 day period, there is a 56% chance that the market will be up.<p>Therefore, saying that the stock market has a 75% chance of being up during the current window is not significantly greater than any other 5 to 10 day window. Consequently, traders should look at calendar tendencies more as entertainment than as a tool to make money.<h3>Disappointed bulls from February</h3><p>Many of the bulls who bought in February and who did not exit are afraid of a double top and another big selloff. They are hoping that the rally will go a little higher to allow them to exit without a loss.<p>That stock that they are eager to sell is supply. There might be too much of it to overcome any buying by traders wanting a new high. We will find out in July.<p>Sometimes the market will go a little above the old high before traders sell. Some want to see if the breakout will be so strong that they are willing to hold onto their stock. If they think it is not strong enough, they will sell.<p>A reversal down from above the February high would still be a double top. I would call that a higher high double top.<h3>If there is a trend reversal down, where is support?</h3><p>The bears want a reversal down. It does not matter if it began this week, or if it comes from a test of the gap or from above the old high. They see the 2 1/2 year trading range and are confident most breakout attempts up or down will fail.<p>They know that the 3 month rally was surprisingly strong. Additionally, they understand that a reversal down will be a leg in the trading range and not the start of a bear trend that will fall below the March low. They expect a higher low and for the bulls to look to buy somewhere in the middle of the range.<p>In a trading range, traders expect reversals to reach around the middle of the range. That is 2800. Also, a 50% retracement of the 3 month rally is around 2700. And so is a measured move down based on the height of the June trading range.<p>The breakout above the March 31 high of 2619.00 was never tested. That is around 2600, which is another Big Round Number and therefore a magnet.<p>Within a trading range, there are always many targets. I just mentioned some of the more significant ones. But somewhere between 2600 and 2800 is what most traders expect.<p>Legs in trading ranges tend to go further than what seems reasonable. Since the Emini is still in a trading range, traders expect a bear leg to begin soon. There is a 50% chance that it will reach to around 2600 before the bulls buy aggressively again.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders expect a 50% retracement but think the Emini might have to test the gap above the February 24 high first.<p>Last week was a bear bar on the weekly chart. It is a Low 2 sell signal bar for this week. The bears see the 3 month rally as a lower high double top with the February high.<p>But the bull trend has been very strong and the Emini has been sideways for a month. This is a weak sell setup. Consequently, even if the Emini falls below 2700 over the next few months, the bulls will buy the selloff. They expect a test of the June high after a surprisingly strong rally.<p>Tomorrow is the last day of the month. The bulls want a bull body on the monthly chart. However, the bears want June to close near its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices in July.<p>With the Emini sideways for 4 weeks and tomorrow being the end of the month, traders might wait for July to decide on the direction of the next several weeks. This increases the chance of the Emini staying around the open of the month through tomorrow’s close.<h3>Low 2 top on the weekly chart</h3><p>The bears want today to go below Friday’s low. That was the low of last week. If today fell below, it would trigger a weekly Low 2 top sell signal.<p>But the Emini has been in a trading range for 4 weeks. Most trading range breakout attempts fail. Consequently the bears need more to convince traders that they are in control. They need a close far below Friday’s low and follow-through selling for several days. Without that, the Emini will continue to be neutral<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex session. Friday was a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. That typically leads to a test of the start of the channel and then a trading range.<p>Friday’s bear channel began exactly at the open of the month, which is already an important target. The Emini has oscillated around it for 3 days. Coming into the day, traders expect at least a couple hours of trading range price action today, and it could last all day.<p>With the Emini is a trading range for a month, there is an increased chance of trading range trading on the 5 minute chart. Also, Thursday’s unemployment report is important. That is another reason why the Emini might stay sideways this week.<p>Finally, the Emini is near the bottom of the range. That increases the chance of a bounce early this week.<p>This week’s seasonally bullishness increases the chance of a bounce. This is true despite last week being a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. But a strong selloff far below last week’s low would shift the odds in favor of lower prices for several weeks.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-29.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-reversing-up-from-bottom-of-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-29-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex reversing up from bottom of bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been sideways for 4 weeks. But the trading range is in a bull trend and it is therefore a bull flag. That means there is a slightly higher chance of a bull breakout.<p>The EURUSD rallied for 2 days last week and then pulled back to test the bottom of the trading range. It is reversing up again today. If today closes near its high, it would further increase the chance of a break above the top of the range.<p>When a market is in a trading range, the probability of a bull or bear breakout is rarely more than 55%. The market would not be going sideways if one side had 60% chance of more of winning. However, if today closes near its high, the bulls will have a 55% chance of a breakout above the June 16/June 23 double top.<p>It is important to remember that there is no breakout until there is a breakout. Consequently, the bears still have a 45% chance that the 2 day rally will fail. If there EURUSD reversed down this week from below the double top, the odds will shift back to 50-50, or possibly even slightly in favor of the bears.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied from last week’s close overnight. Day traders have only been buying for 5 hours after a 28 pip pullback at the start of the European session. If there is another 25 – 30 pip selloff this morning, day traders will begin to sell for scalps as well as continue to buy.<p>The key today is whether the day will close near its high. The closer it closes to the high, the more traders will expect higher prices tomorrow. But if the bears get the day to close in the middle of the range, traders will look for a sideways day tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-High-2-weekly-buy-signal-after-failed-Low-2-sell-signal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 weekly buy signal after failed Low 2 sell signal \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That triggered the Low 2 top sell signal on the weekly chart. However, it then reversed up in a bull trend day.<p>On the 60 minute chart, there have now been 3 consecutive expanding triangles. Each one is smaller. Today’s was an oo (consecutive outside bars). The bears continue to fail. That increases the chance of higher prices for at least a couple more days.<p>Today was the 4th consecutive day that traded above and below the open of the month. Tomorrow is the final day of the month. Therefore, the open of the month will probably be a magnet tomorrow, especially in the final hour.<p>The bulls want a big bull body on the monthly chart. They will try to get tomorrow to close far above the open of the month.

Traders expect a 50% retracement but think the Emini might have to test the gap above the February 24 high first.<p>Last week was a bear bar on the weekly chart. It is a Low 2 sell signal bar for this week. The bears see the 3 month rally as a lower high double top with the February high.<p>But the bull trend has been very strong and the Emini has been sideways for a month. This is a weak sell setup. Consequently, even if the Emini falls below 2700 over the next few months, the bulls will buy the selloff. They expect a test of the June high after a surprisingly strong rally.<p>Tomorrow is the last day of the month. The bulls want a bull body on the monthly chart. However, the bears want June to close near its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices in July.<p>With the Emini sideways for 4 weeks and tomorrow being the end of the month, traders might wait for July to decide on the direction of the next several weeks. This increases the chance of the Emini staying around the open of the month through tomorrow’s close.<h3>Low 2 top on the weekly chart</h3><p>The bears want today to go below Friday’s low. That was the low of last week. If today fell below, it would trigger a weekly Low 2 top sell signal.<p>But the Emini has been in a trading range for 4 weeks. Most trading range breakout attempts fail. Consequently the bears need more to convince traders that they are in control. They need a close far below Friday’s low and follow-through selling for several days. Without that, the Emini will continue to be neutral<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex session. Friday was a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. That typically leads to a test of the start of the channel and then a trading range.<p>Friday’s bear channel began exactly at the open of the month, which is already an important target. The Emini has oscillated around it for 3 days. Coming into the day, traders expect at least a couple hours of trading range price action today, and it could last all day.<p>With the Emini is a trading range for a month, there is an increased chance of trading range trading on the 5 minute chart. Also, Thursday’s unemployment report is important. That is another reason why the Emini might stay sideways this week.<p>Finally, the Emini is near the bottom of the range. That increases the chance of a bounce early this week.<p>This week’s seasonally bullishness increases the chance of a bounce. This is true despite last week being a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. But a strong selloff far below last week’s low would shift the odds in favor of lower prices for several weeks.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-then-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-29.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and then bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/EURUSD-Forex-reversing-up-from-bottom-of-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-29-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex reversing up from bottom of bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been sideways for 4 weeks. But the trading range is in a bull trend and it is therefore a bull flag. That means there is a slightly higher chance of a bull breakout.<p>The EURUSD rallied for 2 days last week and then pulled back to test the bottom of the trading range. It is reversing up again today. If today closes near its high, it would further increase the chance of a break above the top of the range.<p>When a market is in a trading range, the probability of a bull or bear breakout is rarely more than 55%. The market would not be going sideways if one side had 60% chance of more of winning. However, if today closes near its high, the bulls will have a 55% chance of a breakout above the June 16/June 23 double top.<p>It is important to remember that there is no breakout until there is a breakout. Consequently, the bears still have a 45% chance that the 2 day rally will fail. If there EURUSD reversed down this week from below the double top, the odds will shift back to 50-50, or possibly even slightly in favor of the bears.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied from last week’s close overnight. Day traders have only been buying for 5 hours after a 28 pip pullback at the start of the European session. If there is another 25 – 30 pip selloff this morning, day traders will begin to sell for scalps as well as continue to buy.<p>The key today is whether the day will close near its high. The closer it closes to the high, the more traders will expect higher prices tomorrow. But if the bears get the day to close in the middle of the range, traders will look for a sideways day tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-High-2-weekly-buy-signal-after-failed-Low-2-sell-signal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 weekly buy signal after failed Low 2 sell signal \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That triggered the Low 2 top sell signal on the weekly chart. However, it then reversed up in a bull trend day.<p>On the 60 minute chart, there have now been 3 consecutive expanding triangles. Each one is smaller. Today’s was an oo (consecutive outside bars). The bears continue to fail. That increases the chance of higher prices for at least a couple more days.<p>Today was the 4th consecutive day that traded above and below the open of the month. Tomorrow is the final day of the month. Therefore, the open of the month will probably be a magnet tomorrow, especially in the final hour.<p>The bulls want a big bull body on the monthly chart. They will try to get tomorrow to close far above the open of the month. That would increase the chance of higher prices in July.<p>Not only do the bears want June to close below the open of the month, they want it to close on the month’s low.

This triggered a Low 2 top sell signal on the weekly chart.<p>However, it immediately reversed up into a bull trend day. Yesterday is now a buy signal bar on the daily chart for today.<p>The Emini is reversing up from around the bottom of a 4 week trading range in a bull trend. Also, there are 3 consecutive shrinking expanding triangles on the 60 minute chart. While difficult to see, they are there. The failed bear breakout increase the chance of a rally. Traders expect higher prices today or tomorrow. But traders might wait for Thursday’s unemployment report before they will look for a breakout.<p>Because the Emini has been in a trading range for a month, it is neutral. The bulls want a rally up into the gap on the weekly chart above the February 24 high. But the bears want a breakout below the trading range and a measured move down to around 2700.<p>They each have about a 50% chance. The probabilities change a little every day. For example, today is slightly more bullish after yesterday’s reversal up.<p>Since today is the final day of the month and of the quarter, monthly support and resistance are important. The Emini has been oscillating around the open of the month for 4 days. It will probably close around the month’s open and have either a small bull or bear body on the monthly chart.<p>The higher up in the June range that it closes, the better chance the bulls have of higher prices in July. The nearer today’s close is to the low of the month, the more likely July will trade down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 10 points in the Globex session. It will therefore be within about half of a day’s range of the open of the month. If it is within 20 points of the open of the month in the final hour, it will probably test the open of the month one more time.<p>Yesterday is a buy signal bar on the daily chart and the context is good for the bulls. Today will probably go above yesterday’s high and trigger the buy signal. But, because the Emini is in a trading range, there is a reduced chance of a big rally above yesterday’s high.<p>This is similar to yesterday when there was a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. I said before the open that it would probably go below last week’s low and trigger the sell signal. It did, and it reversed up.<p>With the daily chart in Breakout Mode, there is a 50% chance that if the Emini triggers the buy signal today, it will reverse back down within a day or two. Traders might be waiting for Thursday’s unemployment report before looking for a breakout of the 5 week trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-High-2-weekly-buy-signal-after-failed-Low-2-sell-signal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-30.png\" alt=\"Emini High 2 weekly buy signal after failed Low 2 sell signal \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is in a tight trading range, which is a Breakout Mode Pattern. That tight trading range currently is also a triangle.<p>Traders believe that until there is a successful breakout, both the bulls and bears have about a 50% chance of success. The probabilities change every day, but cannot get far from 50%. If they did, the market would not be still going sideways. Today is slightly more bearish because the bulls failed to get a strong reversal up yesterday.<p>Traders look for a measured move up or down based on the height of the range. The bears want a test of the May 1 high and the bulls want a move above the March high. It is important to remember that the 1st breakout fails 50% of the time.<p>The EURUSD might be waiting for Thursday’s unemployment report before breaking out. In the meantime, traders are holding trades for only a day or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low but reversed up from above last week’s low. Last week was an inside bar on the weekly chart. So far, this week is a 2nd consecutive inside bar.<p>The daily ranges have been small. Day traders have been scalping for 10 – 20 pips as they wait for a strong trend up or down.<p>A strong trend can begin at any time. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Day traders will continue to scalp until there is a series of consecutive big bars up or down. That would be a sign that the breakout might be beginning.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-strong-bull-trend-day-with-last-exhaustive-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini strong bull trend day with last exhaustive buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This triggered the buy signal on the daily chart. After rallying for 3 hours, it entered a trading range.<p>There was strong trend resumption up at the end of the day. The Emini briefly got above the 3100 Big Round Number in the final minutes, but pulled back sharply on profit taking. This climactic finish was because today was the last day of the month and of the 2nd quarter.<p>When there is a buy climax into the close, there is a 75% chance of trading range trading tomorrow that starts by the end of the 2nd hour and lasts at least 2 hours. It might have begun with the last climactic reversal. The uncertainty regarding Thursday’s unemployment report also increases the chance of trading range price action tomorrow.<p>I said yesterday that the Emini would be higher today and maybe Wednesday as well. After another strong day today, tomorrow has an increased chance trying to get above 3100 again.<h3>June was a doji bar on the monthly chart</h3><p>Today was the last trading day in June. June had a bull body on the monthly chart. However, it was only a doji bar. In addition, its body was much smaller than May’s, which was smaller than April’s. While bullish, the shrinking bodies represent a loss of momentum now that the Emini is near the top of the 2 1/2 year trading range.<p>A strong rally is good for the buys, but a doji at the top of the trading range on the monthly chart is neutral. This confusion gives no direction for July. Traders assume it will not go far up or down.<p>While this month is a sell signal bar for a reversal down from the top of the range, its bull body and the 3 consecutive bull bodies make is a weak sell setup. There will probably be buyers not too far below the July low.<p>If there is a reversal down, it will probably only last a month or two. There is no sign that the 2 1/2 year trading range is about to end.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The probabilities change every day, but cannot get far from 50%. If they did, the market would not be still going sideways. Today is slightly more bearish because the bulls failed to get a strong reversal up yesterday.<p>Traders look for a measured move up or down based on the height of the range. The bears want a test of the May 1 high and the bulls want a move above the March high. It is important to remember that the 1st breakout fails 50% of the time.<p>The EURUSD might be waiting for Thursday’s unemployment report before breaking out. In the meantime, traders are holding trades for only a day or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below yesterday’s low but reversed up from above last week’s low. Last week was an inside bar on the weekly chart. So far, this week is a 2nd consecutive inside bar.<p>The daily ranges have been small. Day traders have been scalping for 10 – 20 pips as they wait for a strong trend up or down.<p>A strong trend can begin at any time. But until there is a breakout, there is no breakout. Day traders will continue to scalp until there is a series of consecutive big bars up or down. That would be a sign that the breakout might be beginning.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Emini-strong-bull-trend-day-with-last-exhaustive-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-6-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini strong bull trend day with last exhaustive buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini today rallied above yesterday’s high, as expected. This triggered the buy signal on the daily chart. After rallying for 3 hours, it entered a trading range.<p>There was strong trend resumption up at the end of the day. The Emini briefly got above the 3100 Big Round Number in the final minutes, but pulled back sharply on profit taking. This climactic finish was because today was the last day of the month and of the 2nd quarter.<p>When there is a buy climax into the close, there is a 75% chance of trading range trading tomorrow that starts by the end of the 2nd hour and lasts at least 2 hours. It might have begun with the last climactic reversal. The uncertainty regarding Thursday’s unemployment report also increases the chance of trading range price action tomorrow.<p>I said yesterday that the Emini would be higher today and maybe Wednesday as well. After another strong day today, tomorrow has an increased chance trying to get above 3100 again.<h3>June was a doji bar on the monthly chart</h3><p>Today was the last trading day in June. June had a bull body on the monthly chart. However, it was only a doji bar. In addition, its body was much smaller than May’s, which was smaller than April’s. While bullish, the shrinking bodies represent a loss of momentum now that the Emini is near the top of the 2 1/2 year trading range.<p>A strong rally is good for the buys, but a doji at the top of the trading range on the monthly chart is neutral. This confusion gives no direction for July. Traders assume it will not go far up or down.<p>While this month is a sell signal bar for a reversal down from the top of the range, its bull body and the 3 consecutive bull bodies make is a weak sell setup. There will probably be buyers not too far below the July low.<p>If there is a reversal down, it will probably only last a month or two. There is no sign that the 2 1/2 year trading range is about to end.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
