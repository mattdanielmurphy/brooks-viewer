It is now down in the March to October trading range. Traders looked at that as a fair price. They probably will again. Consequently, the Emini might begin to go sideways this week. It could be sideways for a month or more. That is what often happens after a very big move.<p>When there is a huge selloff like last week, the bears have big profits. Also, their stops are now far above. That means their risk is getting too big. They can reduce their risk by buying back (covering) some of their shorts.<p>Traders should expect a strong short covering rally to begin today or tomorrow. Friday is a good buy signal bar for today. However, the 1st reversal up will form a lower high. This is true even if it is very strong and lasts several days.<p>February was a huge outside down bar on the monthly chart. It is therefore a monthly sell signal. March will probably trigger the sell signal by trading below the February low at some point. If you read my weekend blog, you know that there is a potentially huge problem with the coronavirus.<p>However, when there is a very big outside bar, there is an increased chance that the next bar will be an inside bar. If today opens above Friday’s low, there might an early rally as the bulls try to create an inside bar in March.<h3>Did the market fully adjust for coronavirus?</h3><p>Traders are deciding if they have fully priced in the consequences of the corona virus. If the rate of new cases slows this week, traders will wonder if worldwide containment will be successful and it they lowered the price too much. That could result in a big rally over the next week or two. But probably not to a new high.<p>After a Bear Major Surprise, the best the bulls typically can get is a bull leg in a trading range. Then, after 20 or more bars, if they can create some type of a double bottom or wedge bottom, they would have a better chance of resuming the bull trend.<p>However, if there is a steady increase in the number of new cases, and especially if here is a dramatic increase, the odds of a 30 – 50% correction will go up. There is currently only a 30% chance.<p>Most likely, the news will become less bearish and the Emini will be sideways over the next month. With it as oversold as it is, no news should result in a rally, maybe starting today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini rallied strongly overnight but then fell back. Much of the price action is being driven by coronavirus news. There was an increase in cases in the US overnight.<p>But as long as the news is not terrible, the Emini will begin to enter a trading range. Traders suspect that last week might have adequately repriced the market. The bulls therefore are willing to begin to buy and the bears will start to take profits if the news stabilizes. Both expect a trading range once they feel that containment might be successful.<p>The daily ranges and the bars on the 5 minute chart have been huge. Unless a day trader has at least a $50,000 account, he should probably not be trading Emini contracts until the ranges become much smaller.<p>One alternative is to trade micro Emini contracts. They have only 10% of the value of Emini contracts. If the daily range is 10 times bigger than normal, trading a single micro Emini is comparable to trading one Emini contract during normal market conditions. Day traders can also trade big volume stocks or options as alternatives.<p>Since the overnight news was not terrible and the Emini traded mostly sideways Friday, day traders expect legs up and down again today. There is an increased chance of one or more big bull trend days starting early this week.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Emini-triangle-trading-range-open-with-late-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle trading range open with late rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-climactic-reversal-to-middle-of-4-month-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-2-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex climactic reversal to middle of 4 month trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market fell to within 1 pip of closing a gap from 2017 last week. It reversed up violently and is back in the 4 month trading range from late last year. Since traders thought that this area was a fair price for a long time, they will probably again think it is fair. Traders should expect the rally to stall this week and begin to go sideways.<p>The rally is a Bull Surprise. A surprise means a low probability event. Consequently, many traders are positioned incorrectly. The bulls who missed the rally are eager to buy a dip. Also, many bears failed to exit near the low. They want a pullback so that they can buy back their shorts with a smaller loss.<p>With lots of bulls and bears looking to buy a pullback, the 1st reversal down will be minor. This is true even if it lasts a couple weeks, retraces more than half of the rally, and again dips below the October low.<h3>Monthly buy signal</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallies strongly last night to above last month’s high. On the monthly chart, February closed above its midpoint and therefore is a buy signal bar. The overnight rally triggerd the monthly buy signal.<p>Since February had a bear body and its high was in the middle of a 7 month tight trading range, it is a weak buy signal bar. Therefore, there will probably be sellers somewhere above its high. It is more likely that the EURUSD will go sideways for the next month than up above the January high. However, if it breaks strongly above the January high, traders will conclude that the 2 year bear trend has finally ended.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD 5 minute chart has been rallying in a tight bull channel overnight. A big bull trend makes a bear trend unlikely today.<p>The rally went above last month’s high and above the sell climax high on the daily chart. Also, it has been extreme and will soon attract profit takers.<p>There might not be much incentive for today’s huge bull today to continue much higher today. Therefore, traders will probably begin to take some profits. Once they do, the strong bull trend on the 5 minute chart will evolve into a trading range.<p>When it does, bear day traders will begin to scalp. They want to see at least one 30 pip pullback before shorting. And even when they do short, they will look for only 10 – 20 pip scalps.<p>At the moment, day traders are only buying, mostly for swing trades. As the momentum slows, they will begin to switch to scalping. Even once the EURUSD enters a trading range today, it will still probably be easier to make money buying pullbacks than selling rallies.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The initial rally stalled near the 60 minute EMA and the Emini entered a trading range for the middle of the day. The bulls got trend resumption up at the end of the day.<p>With today’s huge rally and close near the high, the Emini will probably be higher tomorrow. If it gaps up, there will be a 3 day island bottom. However, island tops and bottoms are minor patterns.<p>As strong as the rally was, the Emini might be sideways for a month or more. Traders will remain afraid of more bad news about the coronavirus for at least several more weeks. Consequently, any rally will probably only be a leg in a trading range and not a resumption of last year’s bull trend.<p>Because the bears are exhausted, the downside will probably be limited for a week or two unless there is surprisingly bad news about coronavirus. Traders expect higher prices either tomorrow or Wednesday.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Since last week’s collapse was so severe, there will probably be more short covering today or later this week. However, there is currently only a 30% chance that this rally will be a repeat of the January 2019 reversal. That rally went straight up for 4 months with only small pullbacks.<p>If there is surprisingly bad news about coronavirus, the bears will get another leg down. There is still a 30% chance of a 30 – 50% correction.<p>However, there were no significant surprises for a few days. Traders are wondering if they drove the market down further than necessary to compensate for the coronavirus.<p>When there is uncertainty, the market usually goes sideways. While there is a bullish bias this week, traders want at least a few weeks without terrible coronavirus news before they will chase a rally to a new high.<p>That is not likely to happen for at least a month or two. It will only happen if the pandemic is contained. Since I think that is unlikely, I suspect a new high is many months away.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 12 points in the Globex session. After an extreme buy climax day like yesterday, there is only a 25% chance of another strong bull trend day lasting all day.<p>Furthermore, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading starting by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>Yesterday spent several hours in a trading range just above the 3000 Big Round Number and the 60 minute EMA. Both are magnets below for today and tomorrow.<p>The Emini has been in a tight trading range overnight. There is an increased chance of a lot of trading range price action after a huge trend day. The overnight range might continue all day. If there is a bear breakout, a measured move down would be in yesterday’s range just above 3000.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The rally has had 3 legs in a bull micro channel. This is a parabolic wedge buy climax, which typically attracts profit taking.<p>Traders should expect several days down to around the November low and a 50% pullback over the next week or so. However, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they have a reasonable chance of a test of the February low.<p>There may be one more brief push up before the profit taking begins. For example, if today’s high remains below yesterday’s high, which is likely, today will be a pullback. It would then be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. If it has a bear body, it would be a weak buy setup. There would probably be more sellers than buyers above its high. That reversal down would create a micro double top with yesterday’s high and could begin a 50% pullback.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market drifted down in a bear trending trading range day so far today. The bulls would like a test of yesterday’s high. At a minimum, they want today to close above the open. Today would then have a bull body on the daily chart. That would make it a higher probability High 1 buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>However, since yesterday might have begun some profit taking, there might not be much buying today. That reduces the chance of a strong bull day.<p>A strong rally typically needs a day or two of sideways trading before the bears can create a strong selloff. That therefore lowers the chance of a big bear day today.<p>A bear trending trading range means there was a trading range, a bear breakout, and another trading range. Most of the overnight trading was within trading ranges. That increases the chance of quiet trading today. Day traders are looking for reversals to scalp for 10 – 20 pips.

Since last week’s collapse was so severe, there will probably be more short covering today or later this week. However, there is currently only a 30% chance that this rally will be a repeat of the January 2019 reversal. That rally went straight up for 4 months with only small pullbacks.<p>If there is surprisingly bad news about coronavirus, the bears will get another leg down. There is still a 30% chance of a 30 – 50% correction.<p>However, there were no significant surprises for a few days. Traders are wondering if they drove the market down further than necessary to compensate for the coronavirus.<p>When there is uncertainty, the market usually goes sideways. While there is a bullish bias this week, traders want at least a few weeks without terrible coronavirus news before they will chase a rally to a new high.<p>That is not likely to happen for at least a month or two. It will only happen if the pandemic is contained. Since I think that is unlikely, I suspect a new high is many months away.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 12 points in the Globex session. After an extreme buy climax day like yesterday, there is only a 25% chance of another strong bull trend day lasting all day.<p>Furthermore, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading starting by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>Yesterday spent several hours in a trading range just above the 3000 Big Round Number and the 60 minute EMA. Both are magnets below for today and tomorrow.<p>The Emini has been in a tight trading range overnight. There is an increased chance of a lot of trading range price action after a huge trend day. The overnight range might continue all day. If there is a bear breakout, a measured move down would be in yesterday’s range just above 3000.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-3-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market had an exceptionally strong rally up from the 2017 gap. The rally has had 3 legs in a bull micro channel. This is a parabolic wedge buy climax, which typically attracts profit taking.<p>Traders should expect several days down to around the November low and a 50% pullback over the next week or so. However, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they have a reasonable chance of a test of the February low.<p>There may be one more brief push up before the profit taking begins. For example, if today’s high remains below yesterday’s high, which is likely, today will be a pullback. It would then be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. If it has a bear body, it would be a weak buy setup. There would probably be more sellers than buyers above its high. That reversal down would create a micro double top with yesterday’s high and could begin a 50% pullback.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market drifted down in a bear trending trading range day so far today. The bulls would like a test of yesterday’s high. At a minimum, they want today to close above the open. Today would then have a bull body on the daily chart. That would make it a higher probability High 1 buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>However, since yesterday might have begun some profit taking, there might not be much buying today. That reduces the chance of a strong bull day.<p>A strong rally typically needs a day or two of sideways trading before the bears can create a strong selloff. That therefore lowers the chance of a big bear day today.<p>A bear trending trading range means there was a trading range, a bear breakout, and another trading range. Most of the overnight trading was within trading ranges. That increases the chance of quiet trading today. Day traders are looking for reversals to scalp for 10 – 20 pips. A strong breakout up or down would be a surprise.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trap-on-Fed-rate-cut-and-then-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trap on Fed rate cut and then bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It retraced about half of the 3 day rally. Yesterday was probably just a pullback from Monday’s rally. There will probably be a 2nd leg up.<p>However, the Emini will probably go sideways for another week or two as long as there is no big increase in the number of coronavirus cases. If there is, the odds of a 30 – 50% correction will go up from the current 30% chance.<p>I have said before that I do not have confidence in Fed Chair Powell. The reversal down on a big rate cut might in part be due to a lack of confidence in Powell. It is a sign that traders fear that there might be a bigger problem out there than what the Fed is telling us. In addition, they do not trust him to handle it.<p>The Emini will probably not get back to the all-time high for at least a few months. Traders repriced the market after the coronavirus outbreak.<p>The pandemic is unlikely to be contained, and there will not be a vaccine for at least a year. Consequently, the Emini will probably not recover its previous price for a long time.<p>If there is an acceleration of the number of cases, the Emini will fall 30 – 50%. There is currently only a 30% chance of a 30% selloff.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>Despite yesterday’s big selloff, it was probably a bull flag after an even stronger 2 day rally. The Emini is up 58 points in the Globex session and it is testing the start of yesterday’s bear channel. That is always a magnet after a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. The rally usually leads to a trading range.<p>Also, the Emini has been in a trading range for 3 days. Since the legs up and down have been huge, day traders have been able to swing trade.<p>It is important to remember that the daily range is about 10 times normal. Day traders should multiply stops and targets by 10 and divide their position size by 10. Trading Micro Eminis is a good way to reduce position size. Scalps are now 5 – 10 points instead of 1 – 2 points.<p>The daily ranges will begin to shrink over the next week. But it will probably be a month or more before they are back to the usual 15 – 20 points.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trap-on-Fed-rate-cut-and-then-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-4.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trap on Fed rate cut and then bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is now a parabolic wedge buy climax at resistance. Traders should expect about a week of sideways to down trading. The pullback might retrace half of the rally and test the November low at the bottom of last year’s 4 month trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to test Monday’s high, but then sold off. It has been sideways for 3 days. Day traders are looking for reversals and 20 pip scalps. That will probably continue today.<p>Today so far is an inside day. If the bulls can get the close to be near the high, today would be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow. Given the bull climax at resistance on the daily chart, there is probably not much left to this rally.<p>It is more likely that today will close below the open. If the bears can get the close to be near the low of today, today will be a sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>But after 10 days without a pullback, there will probably be buyers tomorrow not far below today’s low. However, the buy climax will probably result in the EURUSD trading sideways to down for about a week.

It is therefore a High 1 bull flag and a buy signal bar for today. Because the sell climax last week was so extreme, the bounce could last a couple of weeks. Therefore, traders expect at least another few days of sideways to up trading.<p>This is a bear rally. Traders should also expect it to disappoint the bulls. Yesterday was a 2nd leg up. That might be all that the bulls get. However, as long as there is no surprisingly bad news about coronavirus, this bear rally might continue for another week.<p>Tomorrow is Friday. The close of the weekly chart will be important. The bulls want last week to be a bear trap in a bull trend. They would like this week to close on the high. This week would then be a strong buy signal bar for next week.<p>But the Emini is more likely to be sideways to down for at least several more weeks. Therefore, this week will probably not close on its high. Even if it does, there will probably be sellers not far above its high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 60 points in the Globex session. It has been sideways for 3 days. On the 60 minute chart, there is a double top and a big gap down today will probably form a double bottom. It is therefore in Breakout Mode. Traders are deciding if the bear rally will continue higher or if the bear trend on the daily chart will resume.<p>Tuesday formed a bear channel on the 5 minute chart. A bear channel is a bull flag because there is a 75% chance of a bull breakout. Yesterday broke above it and rallied. Yesterday was a bull channel. That is a bear flag. Today will gap below it. After big moves up and down, traders expect reversals.<p>Also, while yesterday was a small 2nd leg up on the daily chart, it had a bull body. It is therefore a weak sell signal bar. There will probably be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>In addition, the 60 minute EMA has been a magnet for a few days. It is around yesterday’s low. Consequently, even if there is a big gap down, the Emini will be near support. Also, it will be near the bottom of a trading range on the 60 minute chart. This reduces the chance of a big bear trend day. In addition, it increases the chance of a swing up at some point today.<h3>Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range</h3><p>When there are good technical reasons for a chart to go up and for it to go down, there is confusion. That is the case on the 60 minute chart.<p>When traders are confused, they take quick profits because they doubt a move will continue very far. They also buy low and buy more lower, and they sell high and sell more higher. This results in a trading range.<p>The 60 minute chart is in a trading range and the Emini will open near the bottom of the range. That reduces the chance of a big bear trend day today. The odds are that the Emini will be in a trading range today. But there will probably be at least a 2 – 3 hour rally at some point.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-triangle-breakout-and-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-5.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle breakout and small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This week’s high is just above the top of the channel.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the bear channel. The top of the channel is bear trend line. If it closes far above the bear trend line, traders will begin to conclude that the 2 year bear trend has ended. They then would see the EURUSD as either in a trading range or in a bull trend on the weekly chart.<p>Yesterday was a bear inside day on the daily chart. It was the 1st pause in a 10 day bull micro channel. That makes it a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today.<p>As strong a trend as the bull micro channel is, it is unsustainable and therefore climactic. Also, the EURUSD is now at the resistance of the 18 month bear trend line, the 1.12 Big Round Number, and the top of the weekly bear channel. A big bear bar at resistance is a weak buy setup. Therefore, there probably will be more sellers than buyers above yesterday’s high. The bulls will probably take some profits within the next several days.<p>However, they have been so eager to buy that they have been buying above the low of the prior bar for 10 days. Many will be quick to buy at or below the low of the prior day. Consequently, the 1st reversal down will probably last only 1 – 3 days. With buyers below and probably sellers not far above, the EURUSD will likely go sideways for a week or so.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied strongly overnight. It broke above yesterday’s high to trigger the High 1 buy signal on the daily chart. It also broke slightly above the 1.12 Big Round Number.<p>However, it has been going sideways for a couple hours. As I said above, this is a weak buy setup. Many bulls will begin to take profits above, expecting a pullback for a few days.<p>Since the bulls have been strong and they want the week to close above the bear trend line, the EURUSD might only pull back slightly ahead of tomorrow’s close. It might wait until next week to pull back for a few days.<p>The fight today will be over yesterday’s high, the 1.12 Big Round Number, and the weekly bear trend line. They are very close to one another. As strong as the overnight rally has been, traders might wait until the end of the day tomorrow to decide if the weekly EURUSD chart will close above or below the resistance. As much as the bulls want a close far above, this pause exactly at resistance makes a pullback likely over the next few days.<p>The overnight bull trend has been strong. Also, the weekly chart is important. That reduces the chance of a bear trend today. Traders will buy the 1st 30 pip pullback. But the EURUSD is stalling at resistance and tomorrow’s close is important. That reduces the incentive for a big rally from here today. Today will probably be mostly sideways in a 30 – 40 pip range for the rest of the session.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That made a Bear Trend From The Open unlikely. After a 2 hour wedge rally, the bears got their trend. The Emini reversed down to a new low of the day. The Emini bounced at a measured move down from the high to the open. It then resumed down to test the 3000 Big Round Number.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. That is particularly true in the final hour. Traders see 3000 as a psychological magnet.<p>Also, the open of the week is important. The bulls wanted this week to close near its high on the weekly chart. Traders may then have wondered if last week was a bear trap. It’s not. As I wrote last week, we’re going down, even if we stay sideways for several weeks. Traders now wonder if the week will close below the open of the week. This week would then be a bear Low 1 sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<p>With the week now near the open of the week, the week might be a doji bar. That is a one bar trading range. It increases the chances of more trading range trading tomorrow. However, like every recent days, there will probably be at least one swing up and one swing down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But Wednesday had a bull body on the daily chart. It was therefore a weak sell signal bar. That increases the chance that there might be more buyers than sellers below its low. We will find out today.<p>Although the Emini will open with a big gap down, the odds are against a big bear day today. It will open around the open of the week on the Globex chart. This week is now a big doji inside bar on the weekly chart. The open might be a magnet today. If so, today could be a trading range day that oscillates around the open of the week.<p>Also, the overnight low is near last week’s low. The Emini rallied strongly from that low last Friday. It is therefore support. There will probably be enough buyers around that low again to prevent a big bear day.<h3>Importance of Friday’s close</h3><p>Today is Friday. The week is so far an inside bar on the weekly chart. It is therefore a Low 1 sell signal bar. It would be more bearish if it closes on its low and has a bear body. Therefore, the bears will try to get the week to close on the low. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>If the bulls create a big bull trend day today, traders would see today as forming a double bottom with last week’s low on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of a reversal up again next week. The bulls might then be able to prolong the trading range. But the odds still favor a 2nd leg down whether or not the bulls can get a reversal up for another week or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 90 points in the Globex session. A big gap down only has a 20% chance of a big bear trend from the open.<p>If today is to continue down to below last week’s low today, the bears will probably want to sell closer to the average price. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a trading range open for the 1st hour or two. Once the Emini gets closer to the EMA, the bears will look to sell a double top or a wedge rally.<p>The Emini is opening near last week’s low. It rallied strongly last Friday from this level. Therefore, there is an increased chance that the bulls will buy aggressively again early today. Traders will watch for a possible strong early rally. If there is one, today could be Bull Trend From The Open type of day. Today might then form a double bottom with last week’s low. If so, it could postpone the break to lower prices for a few weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-6.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, it has been in a 20 pip trading range for 3 hours. Also, the day’s range is about as big as the other 3 very big days in the 3 week rally. It therefore will probably not get much bigger. That reduces the chance of a big rally from here today. If there is a new high, the 3 hour trading range will probably be the Final Bull Flag.

When a bull trend is strong, it is better to only buy. In general, it is difficult to make money as a bear until there has been at least one 30 pip pullback. Most bears should wait.<p>If there is a break above this 3 hour range and then a reversal down, the bears will sell for a Final Bull Flag reversal. But the odds of a big move down are small.

It closed near the high and formed a bull reversal bar on the daily chart.<p>The bulls want a double bottom reversal up on the daily chart with last Friday’s low. But today is a relatively small bar with a prominent tail on top.

But Wednesday had a bull body on the daily chart. It was therefore a weak sell signal bar. That increases the chance that there might be more buyers than sellers below its low. We will find out today.<p>Although the Emini will open with a big gap down, the odds are against a big bear day today. It will open around the open of the week on the Globex chart. This week is now a big doji inside bar on the weekly chart. The open might be a magnet today. If so, today could be a trading range day that oscillates around the open of the week.<p>Also, the overnight low is near last week’s low. The Emini rallied strongly from that low last Friday. It is therefore support. There will probably be enough buyers around that low again to prevent a big bear day.<h3>Importance of Friday’s close</h3><p>Today is Friday. The week is so far an inside bar on the weekly chart. It is therefore a Low 1 sell signal bar. It would be more bearish if it closes on its low and has a bear body. Therefore, the bears will try to get the week to close on the low. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>If the bulls create a big bull trend day today, traders would see today as forming a double bottom with last week’s low on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of a reversal up again next week. The bulls might then be able to prolong the trading range. But the odds still favor a 2nd leg down whether or not the bulls can get a reversal up for another week or two.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 90 points in the Globex session. A big gap down only has a 20% chance of a big bear trend from the open.<p>If today is to continue down to below last week’s low today, the bears will probably want to sell closer to the average price. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a trading range open for the 1st hour or two. Once the Emini gets closer to the EMA, the bears will look to sell a double top or a wedge rally.<p>The Emini is opening near last week’s low. It rallied strongly last Friday from this level. Therefore, there is an increased chance that the bulls will buy aggressively again early today. Traders will watch for a possible strong early rally. If there is one, today could be Bull Trend From The Open type of day. Today might then form a double bottom with last week’s low. If so, it could postpone the break to lower prices for a few weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-6.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls want a double bottom with last week’s low. However, the best the bulls can probably get over the next several weeks is a trading range. There is at least a 50% chance of a 20% correction, which would be a bear<em>market</em>.<p><strong>Bond</strong>futures are rallying strongly far above the prior all-time high. While this is a buy climax, there is no top. Traders will buy the 1st reversal down.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has rallied strongly for 2 weeks. Traders believe that the 2 year bear trend has finally ended. The rally is either the start of a bull trend or a bull leg in what will become a trading range.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Surprisingly strong bull breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-strong-breakout-but-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-7.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has strong breakout but buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures has rallied strongly to a new all-time high over the paste 3 weeks on the weekly chart. A strong breakout makes at least slightly higher prices likely.<p>However, the rally on the weekly chart is unusually extreme. Yes, traders will buy the 1st pullback. And yes, at least a small 2nd leg up is likely. But the stop for the bulls is now far below. Traders therefore have unusually big risk. The easiest way to reduce the risk to acceptable levels is to take some profits. Traders therefore should expect some profit taking to begin within the next couple of weeks.<h3>Minor profit taking soon</h3><p>As I said, the bulls will buy the 1st pullback. It will therefore likely only last 1 – 3 bars (weeks on the weekly chart). But the bulls will probably then take profits again after the 1 – 3 bar (week) rally that will likely follow the pullback. If that 2nd rally reverses down, there would be a type of higher high double top. It would also be a consecutive buy climax, which typically attracts profit takers. When the two highs of a double top are only a few bars apart, it is a micro double top.<p>Once the bulls take profits a 2nd time after an extreme rally, they will not be eager to buy again a few bars later. If that was there plan, it would not make sense to take profits.<p>When they take profits, they wait to see how strong the profit taking will be and how aggressive the bears will be. Traders typically like to give the bears at least 2 chances to begin a swing down. If the bears try twice to reverse the trend but fail, the bulls will buy again and the trend up will resume.<p>When I say that the bulls will give the bears two chances, I mean most bulls will not buy until after at least a couple legs sideways to down. That process often takes about 10 bars. Sometimes more, sometimes a little less.<h3>Brief pullback soon and then another brief leg up</h3><p>Traders should expect a brief pullback within a couple weeks on the weekly chart. It will probably last 1 – 2 weeks. There will then typically be a 1 – 3 bar rally to a new high. At that point, profit taking will probably result in a 5 – 10 week, sideways to down move.<h3>What about the nested wedge top on the monthly chart?</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-strong-breakout-above-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-7-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart has strong breakout above double top\"></a></figure><p>The monthly chart formed a nested wedge top from 2008 to 2016. That typically results is at least 2 sideways to down legs. Also, the pullback usually has about half as many bars as there were in the rally.<p>The selloff from the 2016 high had 2 legs and lasted 3 years. It met the minimum objective of the bears. However, the nested wedge top made a deeper and longer correction likely. The odds favored a trend reversal lasting a decade or more. This breakout is therefore a low probability event, a Surprise Breakout.<p>When there is Surprise Breakout above a reasonable top like this, traders expect at least a couple legs up. Consequently, they will look to buy the 1st 1 – 2 month pullback on the monthly chart.<p>Furthermore, when there is a strong breakout above a credible top, traders also look for a measured move up based on the height of the top. A measured move up from the 2018 low to the 2016 high is above 190. While that might seem unreachable, it is a logical target for this rally over the next couple years.<h2>What about negative interest rates?</h2><p>I have said that I do not believe that Americans will allow<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"negative interest rates (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\">negative interest rates</a>. While this huge rally increases the chance, I still do not think it will happen. But, the 10 year and 30 year U.S. interest rates could fall very close to zero or even to zero.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Likely end of 2 year bear trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-strong-breakout-above-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-7-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has strong breakout above bear channel\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart reversed up violently over the past 2 weeks after testing the gap from April 2017. It turned up from just 1 pip above the bottom of the gap.<p>The past 2 weeks were surprisingly big bull bars. A Surprise Bull Breakout typically has at least a small 2nd leg up. Consequently, traders should expect the bulls to buy the 1st 1 – 3 bar pullback on the weekly chart.<p>The rally broke far above the 18 month bear trend line. That is the top of the bear channel and it is resistance. It also broke above the high of a 7 month trading range. This is therefore a logical area where the bears might begin some profit taking.<p>But as I said, this rally is surprisingly strong. Because the breakout was far above, it increases the chance of at least a small 2nd leg up. Traders will buy the 1st 1 – 3 bar (week) pullback.<h3>Likely end of 2 year bear trend</h3><p>The reversal up from the gap to above the top of the bull channel and trading range is an unusually strong sign that the bears are losing control. It is strong enough to make it likely that the 2 year bear trend ended. When a bear trend ends, either a bull trend or trading range begins.<p>The 2 year selloff retraced most but not all of the 2017 rally. The bear channel is therefore is a bull flag. This week is starting to break above the bull flag.<p>If there are several more big weeks like the past 2, traders will conclude that the 2017 bull trend is resuming. More often, the 1st rally above a bear channel is the start of a trading range and not a bull trend. The EURUSD is now in search of the top of the trading range.<p>It is often at the start of the bear channel. That is the top of the 1st pullback from the strong reversal down from the top of the bull trend (February 2018). That 1st pullback’s high is the September 2018 high of 1.1816. The rally of the past 2 weeks is already half way there.<h3>Bear channel usually evolves into a trading range</h3><p>A rally after a bear channel usually ends up as a bull leg in a trading range. A leg in a trading range typically stalls after a few bars. After pulling back for a few bars, it begins another leg up. Traders should expect pauses at the lower highs in the 2 year bear channel. This is unlike the start of a bull trend where the pullbacks are brief and the rally can last 5 – 10 bars before there is more than a 1 bar pullback.<p>The bear channel is now probably evolving into a trading range. The current rally is therefore probably a bull leg in what will become a trading range.<p>The top of the range is typically around the start of the bear channel. Consequently, the EURUSD might go sideways for the next couple years between the February 2020 low of 1.0778 and the September 2018 high of 1.1816 (approximately 1.08 to 1.18).<h2>Coronavirus update</h2><h3>The impending coronavirus pandemic is getting all of the attention</h3><p>The developing coronavirus pandemic is a shiny object and we cannot take our eyes off it. It is constantly in the news. It will affect the stock market for many months and possibly until a vaccine comes out next year. The bulls will not aggressively buy until they are confident that there will not be a geometric increase in the number of cases.<p>If there is, that will significantly alter everyone’s habits. In particular, people will spend less money and many will get laid off. They will go on fewer trips and they will avoid crowds like at the malls, movie theaters, concerts, and sporting events. They will also buy fewer unnecessary things for fear of being laid off in what they will see as a slowing economy. Consequently, a pandemic would probably cause a recession later this year.<h3>Ignore the news, and think for yourself</h3><p>The news media are not thinking this through. Instead, they are blindly accepting the best case scenario that government officials around the world are promoting. Everyone knows that there is a significant risk of widespread infections until there is a vaccine. That is a year away.<p>What we are doing now is medieval. They used containment in the middle ages during the plague. How well did that work for them?<p>The problem with containment is that the virus is already in too many places. That means that thousands of government officials around the world have to handle containment perfectly. No way.<h3>It is very important to note that we are behaving differently</h3><p>The coronavirus is changing our behavior much more than the swine flu did. Why? Because the American people sense that the news reports are underplaying the story. They believe that the government is not protecting us adequately because the government sees the problem as much less dangerous than we do. I bet the American people have it right. The news should be watching us and instead of us watching the news.<h3>Worse than the 2019 H1N1 (swine) flu</h3><p>The real goal this year is to “contain” the rate of spread. I think it is more likely that the number of cases will begin to increase geometrically like it did with the H1N1 (swine) flu in 2009. So far, 100,000 people worldwide have tested positive for the coronavirus. That is similar to the 1st few months of the swing flu. But within a year, more than 10 million people were infected worldwide with the swine flu and at least 100,000 died.<p>Currently, coronavirus appears at least as contagious than the swine flu. Although many infected individuals have no or mild symptoms, the percentage of very sick patients appears to be greater. It is reasonable to assume that it ultimately will kill more people than the swine flu.<p>I have heard people say that coronavirus is not serious because as many as half of people infected (tested positive) with the coronavirus have no symptoms. That is not a valid conclusion. Compare this with the common flu. More than the 75% of people infected with the flu virus have no symptoms, yet 500,000 people die each year from the flu.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Bear inside bar after extremely big bear bar</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-monthly-SP500-futures-candlestick-chart-has-bear-inside-doji-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-7-3.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly S&amp;P500 futures candlestick chart has bear inside doji bar\"></a></figure><p>In December, the Emini was breaking above the top of a 13 year bull channel. I said that there was a 75% chance of a reversal down to the middle or bottom of the channel beginning within 5 bars (months). It began 2 months later.<p>The Emini is already back to the middle of the bull channel. Since February was a Bear Surprise Bar, there will probably be at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down after the 1st pause.<h3>Bear inside bar and 2nd leg down likely</h3><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart so far has a bear inside bar after February’s collapse. Look back over the past 2 years. There were several bear bars, but no consecutive big bear bars.<p>Also, the 11 year bull trend is still in a tight bull channel. This selloff still could end up as a pullback in the bull trend or the 2 year trading range instead of the start of a bear trend on the monthly chart. But even if it is, traders should expect a bear trend to begin within a couple years.<p>The bulls see February as simply a brief, sharp pullback to the 20 month EMA. That has been support for 4 other selloffs since December 2018 low. There are probably enough bulls expecting it to be support again to prevent March from becoming a 2nd consecutive big bear bar.&nbsp;However, it will probably not be enough to prevent at least one more leg down if there is a 1 – 2 month pause or bounce.<h3>Technical problems are more important than the coronavirus</h3><p>There are some significant technical problems for the bulls. They will probably limit the upside for many months and possibly several years. During the 2017 buy climax, I repeatedly made the point that the rally was the most extreme buy climax in the history of the stock market. I said that there would soon be profit taking and it could last a long time. It lasted a couple years.<p>It is important to note that during each strong selloff, I said that each selloff was likely to be minor because the bull trend was so strong. However, I also made the point that the resumption up after an extreme buy climax is typically brief. It is then often followed by a deeper correction. The 2019 rally was the resumption up. February might have ended the 12 year bull trend.<h3>Trading range for the next 10 years</h3><p>For 3 years, I have been saying that the market would likely top out within 5 years and that the next 10 years would probably be in a trading range. This happened in the 1970’s and again in the 2000’s. Both trading ranges lasted about a decade and both followed strong bull trends. That is what is likely this time as well.<p>How do we know if the bull trend is over? It is still to early to tell. We need more information. For example, if the Emini sells off to the 2018 low and then fails to get above this year’s high for a year or more, traders will begin to conclude that the bull trend had evolved into a trading range.<p>When the market is in a trading range, it often makes one or more new highs, but fails to break far above the old high. Traders lack confidence that the bull trend will resume. Instead of buying a strong breakout to a new high, the bulls take profits. Also, the bears short, confident that the breakout will fail.<p>The opposite happens at the bottom. The result is a series of strong legs up and down that can last a long time.<h3>How tall will the trading range be?</h3><p>The trading ranges in the 1970’s and the 2000’s both had at least a couple selloffs of 40 – 60%. If the market is entering a trading range, that will probably be our future over the next decade.<p>It will be more of a trader’s market and a stock pickers market. There will always be another Amazon or Netflix, but far fewer than over the past 10 years. Finding the next hot stock will be impossible for most people.<p>Buying and holding will probably be disappointing. This is unfortunate because the baby boomers are starting to retire. They were counting on consistent, modest profits on their stocks. If the next decade is a trading range, they will make little or no passive income from their portfolios.<h3>It’s the economy, stupid, not coronavirus</h3><p>These technical forces have been working for several years. The coronavirus scare caused the selloff to come now and made it extremely big and fast. But it was going to come regardless. No one knew what black swan would start it or precisely when it would start.<p>Once there is a vaccine, the coronavirus will no longer be a problem. That means it could affect the market for a year.<p>But what if I’m right and the market is in a trading range for a decade? Can you still blame the coronavirus? Of course not. The economists will come up with all kinds of economic explanations.<p>I have a simple explanation. The stock market was the most overbought in history. It needs a long time for the fundamentals to catch up with the price. It will probably take a decade.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Big bear inside bar after huge bear bar</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-weekly-SP500-futures-candlestick-chart-has-bear-inside-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-7-4.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly S&amp;P500 futures candlestick chart has bear inside bar\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed an inside bar this week. It is a Low 1 sell signal bar for last week. Because it was a doji bar, it is a less reliable sell setup. There might be more buyers than sellers below its low. This could result in several sideways bars on the weekly chart.<p>Last week’s selloff was a Bear Major Surprise Bar. Traders should expect at least a small 2nd leg down. There is a 40% chance that it will be a spike in a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. That means that it would have at least 2 more additional legs down.<p>A Bear Major Surprise typically leads to some type of measured move. For example, traders look for a measured move based on the size of the bear body. That would be around 2700.<p>It would also be around the 2019 March/June double bottom. The selloff does not have to get there. If it does, it does not have to stop there. If it gets there, traders will watch to see if there is a reversal up. They will buy a reasonable looking buy setup.<p>But if the 12 year bull trend has ended, rallies will not lead to a resumption of the bull trend. Traders will sell rallies, expecting the market to continue sideways to down for years.<p>It is important to understand that when a bull trend ends, a bear trend does not have to begin. The market can do sideways for a year or two before a bear trend begins.<p>Therefore, there might not be clarity for a long time. Some will say that the trading range is a bull flag. Other will call it a developing top. Until there is a breakout of the range, traders will buy low, sell high, and take quick profits.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Bear trend, testing last week’s low</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-daily-SP500-futures-candlestick-chart-has-double-bottom-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-7-5.png\" alt=\"Emini daily S&amp;P500 futures candlestick chart has double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is testing last week’s low. Friday was a relatively small day. It is therefore a weak buy signal bar for a higher low double bottom with the February 28 low.<p>The February selloff was surprisingly strong. It will therefore probably dominate the price action for more than a couple weeks. That reduces the chances that a double bottom reversal will lead to a resumption of the bull trend. The best the bulls can probably get over the next few weeks is a bear rally. That means a leg up in a developing trading range.<p>It could retrace more than half of the selloff. But traders should expect sideways to down trading for at least another month.<h3>At least 50% chance of bear market</h3><p>What is the difference between a bear trend and a bear market? Over the past couple decades, institutions have come to agree that the term “bear market” means at least a 20% selloff from the all-time high. This is true for any market. They are not looking at anything else. Therefore, this has nothing to do with charts or technical analysis.<p>When you hear the word “trend,” you immediately picture a chart. It is therefore a term that chartists use and everyone has his own definition. There is agreement that a bear trend means a series of lower highs and lows.<p>However, trends have major and minor highs and lows, and it is often not clear if something is major or minor. Traders are free to use the terms bear trend and bull trend in any way that they would like. No one will question your definition as long as the highs and lows are trending in a fairly obvious way.<p>I believe the daily and weekly charts are probably in the early stages of bear trends. I said last week that there was at least a 50% chance of a 20% correction. That means a bear market. I suspect a bear market is more than 50% likely.<p>Furthermore, I said that there was a 30% chance of a 30 – 50% correction. That is still true. If there are consecutive closes below last week’s low, the probability will go up to at least 40%. Also, if there is a 40 – 50% correction, traders should assume that a decade-long trading range has begun.<h3>Wednesday was weak Low 1 sell signal</h3><p>The daily chart broke below Wednesday’s low. That triggered a Low 1 sell signal. But Wednesday was a bull bar and and it was in a strong 4 day rally. It is therefore a weak sell signal.<p>When that is the case, some bulls will scale in as the Emini falls, expecting a rally back to above Wednesday’s low. That is what often happens when the sell signal bar is weak. Consequently, the bulls have a reasonable chance of a bounce back up to Wednesday’s low this week if there is no bad coronavirus news over the weekend.<p>However, traders believe that any rally will be a pullback in a bear trend or the start of a bull leg in a trading range and not the start of a bull trend. The bulls only have a 30% chance of getting a new high within the next few months.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is appearing to be the case.<p>The Emini traded limit down in the Globex session. Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the S&amp;P futures often traded limit down. There was no Globex market or Eminis back then.<p>I do not ever remember it opening limit down. Limits were created to stop a crash. The hope is that traders will reevaluate and not sell endlessly all day in a panic like they did in the October 1987 Crash. I began my day trading career a month before that crash.<h3>What happens after a limit down move?</h3><p>The limit for the Globex market is 5% down. For the day session, there are additional limits below at 7%, 13%, and 20%. There are<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"additional rules  (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/faq-sp-500-price-limits.html\" target=\"_blank\">additional rules</a>depending on the time of day. Emini trading resumes once trading resumes in the cash equity market.<p>What typically happened 30 years ago after a limit down move was that the S&amp;P futures eventually reopened at a much lower price. Some traders would see it as an exceptional value and buy. Many bears would see it as a brief opportunity to take incredible profits. They too would buy. This buying created enough confusion to result in 2 sided trading and it prevented another crash. There would sometimes be a bull trend later that day or on the next day.<p>But this is bearish, as is the entire selloff from the all -time high. While climactic, there is no bottom yet. Traders should expect lower prices over the next month or more.<p>There were days when the S&amp;P futures fell to the next limit down level. I think there was one day that hit a 3rd level, but I am not sure.<h3>Most traders should not trade limit down days</h3><p>Today is going to be very stressful and unusual. Most traders should not trade unless the day begins to behave normally again.<p>Traders have to be very careful about buying. Most traders should only buy if there is a strong bull trend reversal. Even then, they must get out before the bear trend falls to the next limit down level. It would be horribly stressful to be long and then have the market stop when you have a big loss and no way to get out. You cannot be sure that the market will even open again today. Once it reopens, it could open very far below. You would have an unbelievably big loss.<p>I said last week that the odds of a bear market were now more than 50%. If the Emini falls 20%, which is definition of a bear market, the average loss is 28% before the selling ends.<p>I also wrote a week ago that there was a 30% chance of a 30 – 50% correction. If the market hits 20% down this week, the odds of a 30 – 50% correction would be 50%.<p>Be careful and trade very small, if at all.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 5% in the Globex session and trading has been halted. There will be a big gap down on the daily and weekly charts. Most traders should not trade at all today. Experts will trade small and will be very quick to get out of any trade, but especially out of longs.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-trading-range-day-with-buy-the-close-late-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-9.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with buy the close late rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-9-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has broken far above the 18 month bear channel. Since the 3 week rally has had at least 3 surges, it is a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>That typically attracts profit taking, but there is no top yet. Traders will buy the 1st pullback. But after such an extreme buy climax, the next leg up might only last a day or two. Traders should expect some sustained profit taking for a week or two beginning this week.<p>As I wrote over the weekend, the 2 year bear trend has probably ended. The EURUSD rally might be the resumption of the 2017 bull trend.<p>However, the 2 year bear trend was a Spike and Channel pattern. There is typically a rally that tests the start of the bear channel and then the chart evolves into a trading range. That is what is likely here. The EURUSD Forex market will probably be in a trading range from 1.08 to 1.18 for the next year.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways over night. There is a triangle on the 60 minute chart.<p>A triangle in a strong bull trend is a bull flag. But it is also a good candidate for the Final Bull Flag.<p>If there is a bear breakout, a 1 – 2 week pullback will probably begin. If instead there is a bull breakout, it will probably fail within a few days. The EURUSD will then typically get drawn back to the triangle. It will then probably trade sideways to down for a couple weeks.<p>Since it has been in a triangle overnight, day traders are buying low, selling high, and scalping. The legs are big and scalps have been 20 – 40 pips. If the EURUSD continues sideways, the move will get smaller.<br><br>A triangle is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is therefore an increased chance of a breakout up or down and then a trend day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-limit-down-sell-climax-and-then-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-9-2.png\" alt=\"Emini limit down sell climax and then wedge top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It opened 7% down in the day session, which is the 1st limit down level for the day session. When trading resumed, the Emini sold of sharply, as was likely.<p>Once the selloff reached 20% down from the all time high, everyone bought. The value bulls bought for a bounce and the bears took profits. A 20% correction is a bear market, which is likely soon. The day then entered a big range between the Globex limit down price and the day session limit down price.<p>Because the daily chart is so oversold, it will probably soon have a big rally for a couple weeks. It might begin this week.<p>However, once there is a close that is 20% below the all-time highest close, it usually leads to lower prices over the next 2 – 3 months. On average, traders expect 28% down from the high. They should also expect a recession later this year. Most importantly, they should expect a trading range for the next decade.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It opened 7% down in the day session, which is the 1st limit down level for the day session. When trading resumed, the Emini sold of sharply, as was likely.<p>Once the selloff reached 20% down from the all time high, everyone bought. The value bulls bought for a bounce and the bears took profits. A 20% correction is a bear market, which is likely soon. The day then entered a big range between the Globex limit down price and the day session limit down price.<p>Because the daily chart is so oversold, it will probably soon have a big rally for a couple weeks. It might begin this week.<p>However, once there is a close that is 20% below the all-time highest close, it usually leads to lower prices over the next 2 – 3 months. On average, traders expect 28% down from the high. They should also expect a recession later this year. Most importantly, they should expect a trading range for the next decade.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

After the Crash, the exchanges created rules that they hoped would prevent further crashes. They began to halt trading during any day once the stock market fell a certain percent.<p>There were many limit down moves over the next few years, and the exchanges modified the rules many times. They might modify them again at any time.<p>Will we get more limit down moves over the next month? Back in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, they came in clusters. They obviously are more likely when the daily ranges are huge. So, yes, we might see more.<p>Yesterday, the Emini was in a trading range between the day session 7% limit down level and the Globex 5% limit down level. It closed near the open and formed a doji bar on the daily chart.<p>The market is very oversold on the daily chart. Traders should expect a sharp bear rally to begin within a week. It could begin today.<h3>The importance of 20% down</h3><p>Yesterday’s Emini low of 2715.00 was exactly 20% down from the all-time high. Exact to the tick. The computers clearly bought there so it is important support for traders. But institutions use the<em>closes</em>on the cash index to define a bear market.<h3>What happens after a 20% selloff?</h3><p>Whether or not the bear rally begins today, the cash index will probably close below 2708.92 soon. That is 20% down from the highest close and it would signify that the S&amp;P500 is in a bear market.<p>Once the market falls 20%, the average final lowest close is about 28% below the all time high close. It comes about 4 months after the high on average. Also, if it happens, it takes about 2 years to get back to the old high.<p>But there is an added problem here for the bulls. There were extreme buy climaxes in 2017 and 2019. Both were late in a bull trend. Traders should expect that the stock market to be in a trading range for 10 years. Price got far above fundamentals and it will take about a decade for fundamentals to catch up. Therefore, if there is a new high, it probably will not get far above the current high.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The 3 week sell climax has been unusually extreme. It reversed up yesterday at support. There is now a double bottom on the 5 minute chart with yesterday’s 2 lows.<p>A measured move up would be around Friday’s high. A move above Friday’s low would close the gaps on the daily and weekly charts. That would erase one sign of strong bears. It would also increase the chance of a bear rally, which could last a week or two.<p>Traders expect the bears to cover some shorts soon. Short covering rallies can be very strong. That increases the chance of one or more bull trend days this week.<p>Can today be another big bear day? Probably not. If today sells off, the selloff will more likely be a bear leg in a 2 day trading range than a resumption of last week’s bear trend. The odds favor a profit taking rally to begin this week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-limit-down-sell-climax-and-then-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-10.png\" alt=\"Emini limit down sell climax and then wedge top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There have been 4 surges. Each is one or more big bars followed by one or more smaller bars. Three or more surges mean that the rally is a parabolic wedge buy climax. That typically attracts some profit taking.<p>But it is also a sign of strong bulls. Today went below yesterday’s low. It was the 1st pullback in 13 days. The rally is therefore also a 13 bar bull micro channel. Traders have been so eager to buy that they have been buying above the prior day’s low for 13 days. They finally got an opportunity to buy a pullback.<h3>Profit taking should create minor reversal soon</h3><p>The bulls typically take that buy, expecting at least a scalp. However, it is the 1st sign that the strong bull trend is weakening. Bulls will take more profits soon because their stop is too far below. That creates too much risk. The easiest way to reduce risk to to take some profits. Consequently, traders should expect a couple weeks of sideways to down trading to begin within the next week.<p>The pullback usually tests the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the low of 4 days ago. It also typically tests the 20 day EMA and one or more breakout points. The most obvious is the January 1 high.<p>The bears will probably not be able to create a bear trend without 1st forming a trading range. Traders should expect that bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 2 week selloff for either a test of this week’s high or for a resumption of the 4 week bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off early in the Asian session. It fell below yesterday’s low overnight. However, this bear breakout was only 2 pips. Traders bought at yesterday’s low the the EURUSD rallied 50 pips.<p>The European session has been in a trading range for 6 hours. Day traders are scalping. The legs up and down are big enough for 20 – 30 pip scalps.<p>The bulls want another bull candlestick on the daily chart. However, the open of the day is probably too far above.<p>Alternatively, they do not want today to close on its low and below yesterday’s low. That would increase the chance of lower prices again tomorrow.<p>At a minimum, they would like today to close above its midpoint. If they are successful, they will have a better chance of at least one more brief leg up for 1 – 3 days before there is a bigger profit taking pullback.<p>The bears always want the opposite. They want a bear trend reversal. They know that is unlikely. But they will have a better chance of a minor reversal for a couple weeks if they can start to get some days closing near their lows.<p>With the past 6 hours being sideways, today will probably remain in a trading range. Day traders will look for reversals.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-after-almost-outside-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal after almost outside down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After a double top, it sold strongly and almost fell below yesterday’s low. Today was an Almost Outside Down day.<p>After a selloff, the initial reversal up was minor. The Emini entered a trading range for a few hours. It formed a double bottom higher low major trend reversal, and then rallied back to the high in the final 2 hours. There is now a micro double bottom on the daily chart. Today is therefore a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Traders are deciding whether yesterday’s double bottom and today’s double bottom pullback is the start of a 3 – 5 day short covering rally up to last week’s lower high above 3100. There might be one new low and a wedge bottom first. In either case, traders should expect at least a couple strong bull trend days within the next week. Also, the short covering could last more than a week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday tested the low and reversed up. There is now a micro double bottom on the daily chart. Yesterday is a buy signal bar for today.<p>But consecutive big dojis is not a reliable pattern. It is trading range price action and it increases the chance of more sideways trading today.<p>Traders are deciding if this is the start of a strong 3 – 5 day short covering rally up to last week’s lower high above 3100. There might be one more leg down to a new low and a wedge bottom first.<p>A strong short covering rally should begin within a few days. It might begin today. There is therefore a slightly an increased chance of a big bull trend day today. The short covering will probably last at least a week. It could test last week’s lower high, above 3100.<p>If the bears do get 1 more new low on the daily chart, traders will buy it. The selloff has been unusually severe. A new low would be a 3rd leg down. Bears will cover shorts and bulls will buy. The result will probably be a sharp rally for several days.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini has been selling off in a weak bear channel overnight. It will probably open in the middle third of yesterday’s range. That increases the chance of a 3rd sideways day. Day traders will look for reversals.<p>If today is an inside day, it will create a Breakout Mode pattern of the daily chart. That means it will be both a buy and sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Everyone knows that a big trend up or down is more likely every day than before the recent volatility began. However, today is still more likely to be a trading range day.<p>The legs up and down have been big and therefore are good for swing trading. Since the bars legs on the 5 minute chart are very big, traders must trade small.

Yesterday tested the low and reversed up. There is now a micro double bottom on the daily chart. Yesterday is a buy signal bar for today.<p>But consecutive big dojis is not a reliable pattern. It is trading range price action and it increases the chance of more sideways trading today.<p>Traders are deciding if this is the start of a strong 3 – 5 day short covering rally up to last week’s lower high above 3100. There might be one more leg down to a new low and a wedge bottom first.<p>A strong short covering rally should begin within a few days. It might begin today. There is therefore a slightly an increased chance of a big bull trend day today. The short covering will probably last at least a week. It could test last week’s lower high, above 3100.<p>If the bears do get 1 more new low on the daily chart, traders will buy it. The selloff has been unusually severe. A new low would be a 3rd leg down. Bears will cover shorts and bulls will buy. The result will probably be a sharp rally for several days.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini has been selling off in a weak bear channel overnight. It will probably open in the middle third of yesterday’s range. That increases the chance of a 3rd sideways day. Day traders will look for reversals.<p>If today is an inside day, it will create a Breakout Mode pattern of the daily chart. That means it will be both a buy and sell signal bar for tomorrow.<p>Everyone knows that a big trend up or down is more likely every day than before the recent volatility began. However, today is still more likely to be a trading range day.<p>The legs up and down have been big and therefore are good for swing trading. Since the bars legs on the 5 minute chart are very big, traders must trade small. They should not risk more on any trade than what they were risking a month ago before the increased volatility began.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-after-almost-outside-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-11.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal after almost outside down\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It will probably gap down in the day session.<p>This is the 3rd leg down on the daily chart. There is now a parabolic wedge selloff. That typically attracts profit takers.<p>Traders should expect a strong short covering rally to begin within a week or so. It could last 1 – 2 weeks. But it will still be a bear rally. The daily chart will probably be sideways or down for at least a couple months.<p>The cash index fell 1 point below the 20% pullback level and reversed up yesterday. It will probably close below that price within a few weeks and maybe today. There would then officially be a bear market and the end of the 12 year bull trend. However, there might be a 1 – 2 week strong short covering rally before the cash index finally closes 20% down. More likely, the rally will come after.<h3>Open of the week has been a magnet</h3><p>The Emini has spent 3 days oscillating around the open of the week. It might be a magnet for the rest of the week. This is true even though the Emini is now far below.<p>If the short covering rally begins today, it could get back to the open by tomorrow’s close. The candlestick on the weekly chart would then be a doji. That would be more neutral and much less bearish than how it looks right now.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>After the president’s speech last night, the Emini sold off. It has been bouncing off the -5% Globex limit down level for several hours. That increases the chance of a gap below the Globex limit down level on the open.<p>The 1st limit down level for the day session is -7%, which is just 2% lower. But this selling on the daily chart has become extreme. It increases the chance of surprisingly strong short covering soon. There is therefore an increased chance of a strong bull trend reversal today.<p>The daily chart is obviously in a strong bear trend. While that typically increases the chance of a big trend day, that is less likely here. The daily chart is extremely oversold and it has 3 legs down. Traders know that the bears have huge profits and they are looking for any reason to buy back their shorts.<p>Also, many bulls are looking to buy the start of a short covering rally. With many traders wanting to buy this sell climax, there is a reduced chance of a big bear trend today, despite the Emini being locked limit down in the Globex session.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-test-of-20-percent-correction-and-bear-market.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-12.png\" alt=\"Emini test of 20 percent correction and bear market\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The profit taking will probably last a couple weeks.<p>This week so far is a big bear reversal bar on the weekly chart. The bears want the week to close near its low. This week would then be a sell signal bar for a failed breakout above the bear trend line and the high of the past 13 months.<p>Traders will look for the typical downside targets after a parabolic wedge rally on the daily chart. These are the bottom of the final leg up, the breakout point (the January 21 high), and the 20 day EMA. Traders should expect the EURUSD to work lower.<p>If today is a 3rd consecutive bear day, it will increase the chance of the pullback reaching the targets. This is especially true if today closes near its low. Furthermore, it would tend to make the pullback last longer and fall deeper than it otherwise might. Consequently, the bulls will try to prevent today from closing near its low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off again overnight. The candlestick on the weekly chart closes tomorrow. The bears want the week to close on its low. That would make traders wonder if the 3 week rally was just a leg in a incipient trading range and not the start of a bull trend. Consequently, the bears will sell rallies today and tomorrow.<p>Since the bulls always want the opposite, they will look to buy reversals up from around the session low. They hope that the selloff will form a bull flag on the daily chart. They want the rally to be a resumption of the 2017 bull trend.<p>But with bulls buying low and bears selling high, traders expect trading range price action today. The EURUSD has been sideways in a tight range for the past 3 hours after the selloff early in the European session.<p>The fight for the remainder of the day will be over the close. If today and this week close near the low, traders will expect a quicker move down to the targets. Additionally, the selloff would have a better chance of falling considerably below the targets before the bulls return.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-limit-down-to-circuit-breaker-and-trading-halted.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini limit down to circuit breaker and trading halted\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It quickly fell 2% more on the 1st bar and became limit down on the day session.<p>Today was a trading range day. There were 2 strong rallies but both failed. The day closed near its low.<p>Traders suspect that this selloff will test the December 2018 low. This year would then have erased all of 2019. Furthermore, this year would become an outside down bar on the yearly chart (where each bar is 1 year).<p>It is important to note that the S&amp;P500 cash index closed more than 20% below its all-time high. It is therefore in a bear market, like the Dow and the Nasdaq. The bear market is probably secular and not cyclical. That means it could last for a decade.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

With many traders wanting to buy this sell climax, there is a reduced chance of a big bear trend today, despite the Emini being locked limit down in the Globex session.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-test-of-20-percent-correction-and-bear-market.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-12.png\" alt=\"Emini test of 20 percent correction and bear market\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The profit taking will probably last a couple weeks.<p>This week so far is a big bear reversal bar on the weekly chart. The bears want the week to close near its low. This week would then be a sell signal bar for a failed breakout above the bear trend line and the high of the past 13 months.<p>Traders will look for the typical downside targets after a parabolic wedge rally on the daily chart. These are the bottom of the final leg up, the breakout point (the January 21 high), and the 20 day EMA. Traders should expect the EURUSD to work lower.<p>If today is a 3rd consecutive bear day, it will increase the chance of the pullback reaching the targets. This is especially true if today closes near its low. Furthermore, it would tend to make the pullback last longer and fall deeper than it otherwise might. Consequently, the bulls will try to prevent today from closing near its low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off again overnight. The candlestick on the weekly chart closes tomorrow. The bears want the week to close on its low. That would make traders wonder if the 3 week rally was just a leg in a incipient trading range and not the start of a bull trend. Consequently, the bears will sell rallies today and tomorrow.<p>Since the bulls always want the opposite, they will look to buy reversals up from around the session low. They hope that the selloff will form a bull flag on the daily chart. They want the rally to be a resumption of the 2017 bull trend.<p>But with bulls buying low and bears selling high, traders expect trading range price action today. The EURUSD has been sideways in a tight range for the past 3 hours after the selloff early in the European session.<p>The fight for the remainder of the day will be over the close. If today and this week close near the low, traders will expect a quicker move down to the targets. Additionally, the selloff would have a better chance of falling considerably below the targets before the bulls return.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-limit-down-to-circuit-breaker-and-trading-halted.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-12-2.png\" alt=\"Emini limit down to circuit breaker and trading halted\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It quickly fell 2% more on the 1st bar and became limit down on the day session.<p>Today was a trading range day. There were 2 strong rallies but both failed. The day closed near its low.<p>Traders suspect that this selloff will test the December 2018 low. This year would then have erased all of 2019. Furthermore, this year would become an outside down bar on the yearly chart (where each bar is 1 year).<p>It is important to note that the S&amp;P500 cash index closed more than 20% below its all-time high. It is therefore in a bear market, like the Dow and the Nasdaq. The bear market is probably secular and not cyclical. That means it could last for a decade.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The median size of the selloff in a bear market is 28%. It typically takes about a year to reach the final low and then another 2 years before there is a new high. Yesterday’s close on the cash index was 27% below the all-time high close. That is close enough to make traders think that the selloff might be over.<p>Traders believed that this selloff would test the December 2018 low. The overnight low was close enough to make traders believe that the test is satisfactory.<p>I have been saying this week that a 1 – 2 week big short covering rally was likely to begin within a few days. Today looks like a good candidate. The Emini is up 5% in the Globex session. The CME has halted its trading. It is locked limit up. This makes higher prices likely today.<p>This will be a bear rally and not a repeat of January 2019. The selling will probably not end for a year. If there is now a secular bear market, the Emini will have a difficult time moving much above the February high for the next decade.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>I have been saying that the Emini would have a strong short covering rally that would begin within a few days. It probably began overnight. After selling to below yesterday’s low, it has rallied strongly. It has been locked limit up after a 5% gain above yesterday’s close. This increases the chance of a big bull trend day today. Furthermore, this is probably the start of a 1 – 2 week strong bear rally.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-limit-down-to-circuit-breaker-and-trading-halted.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-13.png\" alt=\"Emini limit down to circuit breaker and trading halted\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It was a parabolic wedge buy climax. The final 3 bull bars were an exhaustive buy climax. Traders expect at least 2 legs sideways to down to support.<p>The past 3 days will be the 1st leg down. The selling has reached all of the targets for the pullback. It tested the 3 day buy climax low, the EMA, the January 31 breakout point, and the 50% retracement level.<p>A big selloff after a big rally is a reversal. It creates confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. Consequently, traders should expect the EURUSD to be sideways to down for at least another week. Also, the bars will probably begin to get smaller.<h3>The importance of the weekly close</h3><p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance are important. The bulls want the week to close above the 18 month bear trend line. That is just a little above the current price.<p>However, the bears want this week’s breakout to fail. They would like this week to close on its low. It would then be a stronger sell signal bar on the weekly chart. They hope that the 3 week rally was just a bull trap in the 2 year bear trend. But, the rally was so exceptional. There will probably be at least a small 2nd leg up after the current pullback ends in a couple weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in the middle of yesterday’s range overnight. So far, the EURUSD has been sideways in a small range. Yesterday’s was big. Today is an inside day. With yesterday having such a big range, today will probably remain an inside day.<p>The low of the week is 80 pips below the current price. Overnight, the EURUSD range would have to double for the week to close on its low. That is unlikely, given how small the legs up and down have been overnight.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the 18 month bear trend line. That is around 40 pips above the overnight high, which is only about half of the overnight range. Consequently, the bulls have a better chance of achieving their objective than the bears.<p>Day traders have been looking for reversals overnight and they have been scalping for 30 – 40 pips. That will probably continue all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-short-covering-rally-and-breakout-above-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini short covering rally and breakout above triangle\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

When the day session opened, the Emini sold off for a couple hours. There was then a wedge bottom that led to a triangle. The bulls got a breakout at the end of the day.<p>Traders are wondering if the Emini is beginning a strong 1 – 2 week short covering rally. It should begin next week and it might have started yesterday. I mentioned early in the day that I bought calls, expecting a strong short covering rally. Everything should go up strongly for a couple weeks.<p>A gap up on Monday would create a 2 day island bottom. There is probably not much more downside risk near-term.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was a parabolic wedge buy climax. The final 3 bull bars were an exhaustive buy climax. Traders expect at least 2 legs sideways to down to support.<p>The past 3 days will be the 1st leg down. The selling has reached all of the targets for the pullback. It tested the 3 day buy climax low, the EMA, the January 31 breakout point, and the 50% retracement level.<p>A big selloff after a big rally is a reversal. It creates confusion, which is a hallmark of a trading range. Consequently, traders should expect the EURUSD to be sideways to down for at least another week. Also, the bars will probably begin to get smaller.<h3>The importance of the weekly close</h3><p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance are important. The bulls want the week to close above the 18 month bear trend line. That is just a little above the current price.<p>However, the bears want this week’s breakout to fail. They would like this week to close on its low. It would then be a stronger sell signal bar on the weekly chart. They hope that the 3 week rally was just a bull trap in the 2 year bear trend. But, the rally was so exceptional. There will probably be at least a small 2nd leg up after the current pullback ends in a couple weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in the middle of yesterday’s range overnight. So far, the EURUSD has been sideways in a small range. Yesterday’s was big. Today is an inside day. With yesterday having such a big range, today will probably remain an inside day.<p>The low of the week is 80 pips below the current price. Overnight, the EURUSD range would have to double for the week to close on its low. That is unlikely, given how small the legs up and down have been overnight.<p>The bulls want the week to close above the 18 month bear trend line. That is around 40 pips above the overnight high, which is only about half of the overnight range. Consequently, the bulls have a better chance of achieving their objective than the bears.<p>Day traders have been looking for reversals overnight and they have been scalping for 30 – 40 pips. That will probably continue all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-short-covering-rally-and-breakout-above-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini short covering rally and breakout above triangle\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

When the day session opened, the Emini sold off for a couple hours. There was then a wedge bottom that led to a triangle. The bulls got a breakout at the end of the day.<p>Traders are wondering if the Emini is beginning a strong 1 – 2 week short covering rally. It should begin next week and it might have started yesterday. I mentioned early in the day that I bought calls, expecting a strong short covering rally. Everything should go up strongly for a couple weeks.<p>A gap up on Monday would create a 2 day island bottom. There is probably not much more downside risk near-term.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But, the<strong>Emini</strong>started to reverse up from a parabolic wedge sell climax on Friday. There will probably be a strong short covering rally for the next 2 weeks.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market has had the most extreme buy climax in its history. This week’s reversal down will probably be the start of a few weeks of sideways to down trading.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market broke strongly above its 18 month bear trend line. The 2 year bear trend is probably over. This week’s strong bear reversal will probably lead to a 1 – 2 week pullback.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Huge buy climax so expect pause in bull trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-14.png\" alt=\"Bond Futures weekly candlestick chart has huge climactic reversal down.png\"></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures market had a huge rally over the past 3 months on the weekly chart. It was especially dramatic over the past 4 weeks.<p>Bond futures reversed down strongly from above the top of its bull channel. The selloff should test the February 21 low within a few weeks. It might reach the October 17 low within a couple months.<p>When a buy climax reverses down, the bottom of the most recent buy climax and of the most recent leg up are magnets. The selloff typically has at least a couple legs sideways to down. It should then evolve into a trading range for several weeks.<p>When the biggest breakout in a bull trend comes late in a bull trend, there is a 60% chance that the bull trend will pause at that point or after one more brief push. Additionally, there is a 60% chance that there will be one more push up. However, this week’s reversal was so extreme that, if there is one more push up, it will probably make a lower high.<h3>A buy climax leads to a pause in the bull trend and not necessarily to a trend reversal</h3><p>It is important to note that I did not say that the climactic reversal down would lead to a bear trend. There is a 40% chance that it will after several months. But there is a 60% chance of the bond market going sideways for a month or more. A trading range is more likely than a bear trend or an immediate resumption of the bull trend.<p>After there are a couple legs sideways to down, the bulls will consider buying again. They will need to see signs that the bears are unable to continue the reversal down into a bear trend.<p>If the trading range lasts 10 or more bars, the bears would then have a better chance of reversing the bull trend into a bear trend. They typically need to stop the bull trend for many bars before traders will be willing to short and hold shorts for a swing down.<h3>Targets for the bears</h3><p>If the bears get a swing down, an important target is the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the low of 4 weeks ago. The 20 week EMA and the August high are magnets as well.<p>The 3 weeks before this week’s reversal were in a breakout. They broke above the old high, which is the August high. It is therefore the breakout point. After a breakout, there typically is an eventual pullback to the breakout point. Traders want to see if the bulls will again buy at that price. If enough do, the bull trend will resume.<h3>After Big Up, Big Down, there is Big Confusion</h3><p>This week’s selloff was big, while not as big as the 3 week rally. However, it was big enough to generate confusion. Traders are wondering how long the sideways to down trading will last and how far it will go. They typically need many weeks before they can draw a conclusion.<p>In the meantime, they are uncertain. When traders are uncertain, they are unwilling to hold onto positions very long. Additionally, they prefer to buy low and sell high. The result is a trading range, and that is what traders should expect over the next month.<p>When the market is in a trading range, there are usually more traders looking to buy below bars and sell above bars. They bet on reversals instead of trends. Consequently, even though this week is a sell signal bar, the reversal down will probably be minor. That means traders expect that the 1st leg down will lead to a trading range and not a bear trend.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Pullback from extreme buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-bear-trend-reversal-after-strong-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-14-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex bear trend reversal after strong bull breakout\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart this week formed a big bear reversal bar after 2 huge bull bars. The rally was the strongest in 2 years. It broke far above the 18 month bear trend line and above the January major lower high. Traders are concluding that the 2 year bear trend has ended.<p>The end of a bear trend means either the start of a bull trend or of a trading range. A trading range is more common. This week’s big bear bar increases the chance of a trading range for at least a few weeks. Big Up, Big Down means Big Confusion. Confused traders are quick to exit positions. This limits the movement up and down and typically creates a trading range.<h3>2nd leg up likely after 1st pullback</h3><p>Whether this is the start of a bull trend or just a strong bull leg in what will be a trading range, the rally was strong enough so that traders will expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>However, it was so extreme that the bulls are exhausted. Exhausted bulls typically take at least partial profits. They usually do not look to buy again just a few bars later. If that was their plan, they would hold long.<p>They know many bulls will take profits and bears will begin to sell. The bulls typically give the bears at least a couple chances to create a bear trend. After 2 legs sideways to down, the bulls will decide if the bears are failing. If they see a good buy setup, they will buy again, looking for a resumption of the bull trend.<p>On the other hand, if the selling keeps drifting down for 10 or more bars, the bulls will continue to wait. If the selloff lasts a month or more and retraces 60% or more of the rally, traders will conclude that the bull breakout was the start of a trading range and not a bull trend.<h3>What about next week on the daily chart?</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-daily-Forex-bear-trend-reversal-after-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-14-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD daily Forex bear trend reversal after parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>This week’s reversal down was big enough to make traders think that significant profit taking has begun. They therefore expect a couple legs sideways to down over the next couple of weeks.<p>The 1st target is the bottom of the most recent buy climax. On the daily chart, that is the low of last week’s 3 big bull bars. That is around the January high, which is a breakout point and therefore a magnet. Additionally, it is around the magnet of the 20 day EMA. Another common target is a 50% pullback. Thursday’s selloff reached all of those targets.<p>Some bulls will buy above the high of the previous bar on the daily chart, hoping that the bull trend will quickly resume. After 4 consecutive bear bars, there will probably be more sellers than buyers above bars for at least a couple weeks. The bulls will have a higher probability of making money if they wait to buy until the EURUSD has couple legs sideways to down and begins to form bull bars.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Consecutive big bear bars but still in 2 year trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-chart-testing-bottom-of-2-year-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-14-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly chart testing bottom of 2 year trading range\"></a></figure><p>Until February, the monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;was in a strong bull trend since 2009.<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/trump-corporate-tax-cut-rally-might-be-january-barometer/#buy-climaxes-on-daily-weekly-monthly-charts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"I have made the point many times that the buy climax at the end of 2017 was the most extreme in history.  (opens in a new tab)\">I have made the point many times that the buy climax at the end of 2017 was the most extreme in history.</a>This was true on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. There was likely to be a pause and then one more leg up before a bigger pullback.<p>That is what happened. Last year was a 2nd buy climax after 2 sideways years. The stock market reversed down violently over the past 2 months on the monthly chart.<p>But 2 down months do not make a bear trend. It is more likely that the selloff on the monthly chart will be a bear leg in what will become a trading range for several months. However, the odds favor a bear trend on the monthly chart whether or not there is a trading range for several months first.<p>There is support at the December 2018 sell climax low. This initial selling might have stopped this week around that low. The big tail on the bottom of the March candlestick is a sign of strong buying.<h3>Possible head and shoulders top later this year</h3><p>If there is a bounce that lasts several months and then another reversal down, traders will wonder if the 2 year trading range is a head and shoulders top. If the bears get a lower high with good sell signal bar, there would be a 40% chance of a bear trend.<p>While any one signal has a 40% chance of leading to a bear trend, there is a 50% chance of a bear trend beginning on the monthly chart within the next 12 months.<p>The obvious bear target would be a measured move down based on the height of the 2 year trading range. Remember, there might be a head and shoulders top if there is several months of sideways trading. That measured move would be around the bottom of the 2014-2015 trading range, which would be about a 40% correction.<h3>Sideways for the next decade</h3><p>I said in late 2017 that there would be a top within 5 years that would lead to a couple 40 – 50% corrections over the next decade. The February high could be that top. But, the monthly chart might go sideways for a year or more before there is a strong 2nd leg down.<p>I also said that the stock market will probably be in a big trading range for the next decade. This is true even if there are one or more brief new highs during the decade.<p>Traders should still expect this because this is what typically happens after an extreme buy climax. Price gets far ahead of the fundamentals and it takes about a decade for the fundamentals to catch up. This happened in the 1970’s and the 2000’s.<h3>Can this selloff be a bear trap?</h3><p>Can this selloff simply be a sharp pullback in a 12 year bull trend? A bear trap? The bulls have a 30% chance of that. After consecutive buy climaxes (2017 and 2019) in the most overbought market in history, there is a 70% chance of at least 2 legs sideways to down.<p>The 2 month selloff is forming the 1st leg down. Traders are deciding where this 1st leg down will end. It could end at any time. It might have ended this week.<p>But even if there is a strong reversal up over the next couple of months, the odds would still favor a 2nd leg sideways to down after that rally. Traders should assume that the best that the bulls will get over the next couple months is a bounce in a trading range and not a resumption of the bull trend.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong selloff testing the bottom of last year’s trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-chart-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax-at-bull-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-14-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly chart parabolic wedge sell climax at bull trend line\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart sold off strongly over the past 3 weeks. It broke below the 12 year bull trend line, but held above the December 2018 bottom of the 2 year trading range. The strong, late buying on Friday lifted the week’s close above the bull trend line and back to the middle of the week’s range.<p>Can the selloff continue straight down to below the December 2018 low of 2343.25? There is a 40% chance at this point that the collapse will reach that target before there is at least a 2 week bear rally.<p>The selloff has been exceptionally extreme. Many bears will be eager to take some of their exceptional profits soon. Additionally, a reversal up could be violent. It might have begun in the final 30 minutes on Friday.<p>We are getting near the end of the quarter. The last 2 weeks of March have a bullish bias. That is another factor that could contribute to a sharp short covering rally soon.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Reversing up from parabolic wedge sell climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-chart-trend-reversal-up-after-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-14-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily chart trend reversal up after parabolic wedge sell climax \"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini chart is in a bear trend. A bear trend refers to the behavior of the chart.<p>Once a selloff reaches 20%, there is a bear market in addition to a bear trend. The S&amp;P cash index, the Dow, and the Nasdaq all closed 20% below their all-time highest closes this week. They are also in bear trends on the daily and weekly charts.<p>When there is a bear market, the final low is typically much lower than 20% The median selloff is 28% and it lasts 13 months. It then takes 21.9 months on average to make a new high. My shorthand way to think about this is that I expect a bear market to fall about 30% over a year and take 2 more years to make a new high.<p>There is lots of variability. Some bear trends end much sooner and barely fall more than 20%. Others last for years and fall more than 50%. It is too early to know what will happen this time.<p>But this selloff has been unusually severe. Also, the selloff followed extreme buy climaxes in 2017 and 2019. The one in 2017 was the most extreme in the history of the stock market. Furthermore, this was the longest bull trend in history. Traders should expect this bear market to fall more and last longer than average.<h3>The Emini has already fallen 28%</h3><p>This week’s low in the Emini was 28% below the all-time high. Also, the S&amp;P500 cash index closed 27% down from its highest close on Thursday. Both have fallen as much as the average bear market.<p>It is important to note that Friday’s late rally put the close of the cash index at 2711.02. Why is that important? Because a 20% correction down from the highest close is 2708.92. That defines a bear market.<p>One of the goals of the bulls who created that huge 175 point rally in the final half hour on Friday was to get today’s close back above the 20% correction level. The bulls succeeded by 2 points!<p>Therefore, the bears only got one daily close below the magic price and they failed to get a weekly close below that price. Their case would have been stronger if they got consecutive daily closes below and a weekly close below. That is a sign that the bulls might be retaking control, at least temporarily. It increases the chance of a strong rally over the next 2 weeks.<p>Remember that bear trends typically have at least a small 2nd leg down after the 1st strong reversal up. Consequently, this week’s low will probably not remain as the bottom of the bear trend. The odds are that the final low be lower. That means the correction will be at least 30% down from the high. There is a 40% chance that it will be around 40% down.<h3>Strong bear rally likely after parabolic wedge sell climax</h3><p>As strong as the selloff was, there were 3 legs down in a tight bear channel. The 3rd leg down broke far below the trend channel line drawn across the bottoms of the 1st 2 legs. That is a parabolic wedge sell climax. When it is extreme, it usually attracts profit taking by the bears.<p>Also, many bull traders will buy, expecting a strong short covering rally. I mentioned in the chat room on Friday that I bought SPY calls near the bottom of the morning selloff.<h3>Everything will go up in a bear rally</h3><p>It is important to note that all sectors sold off. They therefore will probably all rally. It is likely that value hunters will be buying just about everything for a trade up for a couple weeks.<p>The bears will be frantically buying back their shorts once they see the market not continuing down. But, after a couple legs up, they will look to sell again. They know the odds are that there will be a 2nd leg down after such an extreme selloff.<p>The short covering rally after a wedge bottom typically has at least 2 legs sideways to up. It usually stalls at the top of the pullback from the 2nd leg down. That is the March 10 high of 2873.50.<p>While that can be the end of the rally, it more often continues up to the start of the wedge bear channel. That is the March 3 high of 3125.75.<p>At the close of Friday, there was a 60% chance that the rally has begun. If Monday or Tuesday is a big bull day, there will be a 70% chance of a strong short covering rally.<p>Can the market continue to collapse? Unlikely. There is a 30% chance that the selloff will continue down to below the December 2018 low before there is more than a 3 day bounce.<h2>75% chance of recession</h2><p>There have been unusually extreme buy climaxes on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts over the past 2 years. These patterns have led to write over the past several months that there was a 75% chance of a recession in 2020.<p>Rarely is anything that certain in the financial world. However, many business are greatly reducing their services. Travel is the most obvious example. Also, when the value of stocks fall this much, wealth is lost and consumption goes down. That ripples through the economy and causes layoffs and a further reduction in consumption. I now believe that the odds of a recession are at least 75%. I suspect closer to 100%.<h3>Coronavirus is not the problem</h3><p>The media are blaming coronavirus, but that is because they are in the news business. They believe that everything important is caused by something in the news. The sun revolves around them. They are the center of the universe.<p>If this bear trend is due to coronavirus, why is it that 2 years ago, I repeatedly said that the Emini would enter a 10 year trading range within a few years? I said that because the 2017 buy climax was the most extreme in history. It was strong enough to have at least a small 2nd leg up, but it was likely to be the start of a major top. The 2019 buy climax completed that top.<p>Therefore, you can think of the past 2 years as investors building a bomb in the market. Coronavirus hit the switch and it blew everything up. But it was going to blow up anyway. If there was no pandemic, some other black swan would have come along and triggered the explosion.<h3>Most extreme buy climax in history</h3><p>As I mentioned above, I said 2 years ago that the market was forming the most extreme buy climax in history. Furthermore, I repeatedly compared it to the rallies in the 1960’s and late 1990’s. Also, I said that both led to trading ranges over the next 10 years and traders should expect the same this time.<p>In a couple years, coronavirus will no longer be in the news. So why won’t the bull trend resume? Why not in 5 years? Is it still coronavirus? Of course not. Extreme buy climaxes need a long time to resolve. It will probably take about a decade.<p>In a couple years, you will no longer hear about coronavirus on the business news stations. If the market is still sideways to down, you instead will hear about how the stock market was not generating the earnings that traders expected in 2019 and 2020. You will also hear that the market was propped up by the Fed and incredible borrowing. In fact, those are the real reasons for this bear market. I suspect that it will much longer than a few years for them to go away. They will be here long after coronavirus is gone, and therefore coronavirus was the temporary excuse, but not the underlying long-term problem.<h3>Is this a secular or cyclical bear market?</h3><p>These are other terms that you will sometimes hear. The simplest distinction is that a cyclical bear trend is shorter term, lasting one to 3 years. It is a pullback in a secular trend.<p>A secular trend lasts many years or even a decade. It typically contains one or more cyclical trends up and down within it, but the underlying force behind the secular trend remains intact.<p>When a selloff falls about 20% and lasts about a year, traders call it a cyclical bear market. The implication is that it is just a protracted pullback in a much bigger bull trend.<p>If the market falls 40%, traders will start to refer to the selloff as a secular bear trend or market. Remember, “trend” refers to the chart pattern and bear “market” refers to a loss of more than 20% from the all-time high. When there is s bear market, the daily chart is usually in a bear trend.<p>In a secular bear market, there are cyclical bull trends. Their average gain is about 65%, but they end in about 18 months, and then there is another swing down.<p>Since I believe that the market will be sideways for about a decade, the 12 year secular bull market is probably ending. If the market goes sideways for a few years, traders will begin to refer to it as being a secular bear market. They will then assume that any rally will fail to get much above the old high.<h3>World economic forces might be turning bearish</h3><p>The charts are indicating that the world’s economic forces are transitioning into a bearish mode from the bullish mode of the past 12 years. This is impossible to know for certain for at least a few years, but that is what happened in the 1970’s and the 2000’s. Both decade-long trading ranges followed huge bull trends. Price got far ahead of the fundamentals. It took about a decade for the fundamentals to catch up.<p>There has been a secular bull trend since 2009. If there now a secular bear market, the bearish forces will probably control the market for about a decade. Those forces will eventually overwhelm every 1 – 2 year strong rally.<p>While there might be one or more brief new highs over the coming decade, if this is in fact a secular bear trend, the market will probably be unable to go far above prior highs. Furthermore, it will probably fail to stay above for very long.<h3>Great buying opportunity for retirement Account? NO!</h3><p>A friend of mine told me he sees this selloff as another great buying opportunity for his retirement account, just like every other selloff for the past 12 years. He said he bought last week when the market was 10% down. I told him that I have been saying that every selloff for the past 12 years was minor. So yes, even a 10% reversal was likely to resume up to a new high. The market was in a secular bull trend. Every selloff was a buy because a new high was likely.<p>But the market is now a bear market. And it might become a secular bear trend. This is different from everything that has taken place for 12 years. You cannot trade it the way you have been trading. This is not the time to buy unless you are a trader looking for occasional bear rallies. Even then, you will lose money if you do not know how to manage your trades.<p>Even if this turns out to be a routine bear market (cyclical bear), the low is still likely to be many months to a year away. There is no need for investors to buy now. They might be able to buy lower in about a year.<p>Also, it typically takes about a year before there is a test of the high after a bear market begins. Consequently, there is no rush to buy.<p>Finally, if I am right and the market will be in a trading range for 10 years, investors will be frustrated by their lack of returns. Traders waiting to buy 30 – 50% pullbacks and then taking profits on rallies of about 50% will probably do better than buy and hold investors over the next decade.<h3>What to expect next week</h3><p>The daily chart has had 3 legs down in a tight bear channel. This is a parabolic wedge selloff. That typically attracts profit takers, especially when the selloff has been extreme and especially when it is near major support. The December 2018 low and the 11 year bull trend line are major support. Consequently, traders are looking for a 1 – 2 week bear rally to start within a week or so.<p>It might have begun with the very strong rally in the final 30 minutes of trading on Friday. If there is a gap up on Monday, there would be a 2 day island bottom. That would increase the chance of a strong bear rally.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Since the selloff had 3 legs down, it is a parabolic wedge. That usually attracts some profit taking. This is especially true when the climax is extreme and near support. Traders see the selloff as a test of the bottom of the 2 year trading range. That is the December 2018 low.<p>Friday sold off and then reversed up strongly. The context on the daily chart is good for the bulls. If today is a big bull day, then the 1 – 2 week short covering rally would have likely begun. If so, everything will probably go up for the next week or so.<p>But it is important to note that the daily chart is in a strong bear trend. When there are big surprises in a strong trend, they usually come in the direction of the trend. Consequently, despite a parabolic wedge bottom at support, the Emini could collapse further today and over the next week.<p>It has been crashing for 4 weeks, but not quite enough to be called a crash. If it hits the 13% or 20% locked limit down levels today, traders will call it a crash. It would then be comparable to 1987 and 1929.<h3>Limit down in the Globex session</h3><p>The Emini traded down 5% in the Globex market and it has stayed there. That means it is locked limit down. Traders are deciding if the overnight selloff is a pullback from Friday’s late rally or if that rally has failed. Will Friday’s rally just be a bull trap in a strong bear trend? Or, will today’s limit down open reverse up quickly and be a bear trap in a new 2 week rally?<p>Remember, even if today reverses back up strongly, traders should expect the final low to be many months from now. It might even come in a year. This is not January 2019. This looks like 1987 or worse. If a V bottom begins, there is only a 20 – 30% chance that it will be the end of the bear trend.<p>When there were only 100 Americans infected with the coronavirus a few weeks ago, I said that 40 – 70% of America could get infected. America’s behavior tells me that people are coming to that conclusion.<p>Very few of us were around during WWII or the Great Depression, and none of us lived through the 1919 pandemic. Those are the last times when there was such a widespread, prolonged change in the behavior of America. This change has probably already created a recession. Traders are deciding how bad things will get. If today sells off strongly, then a 40 – 50% selloff will be more likely than not.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is locked limit down. It will probably stay limit down until the day session opens. There might be enough panic selling to quickly drive it down to -7%. That is the 1st day session limit.<p>I mentioned that there are additional trading halts at -13% and -20%. If it hits either, this will be called a crash. Crashes are rare. There were only 2 in the last century. I was trading during the 1987 Crash. The extreme change of behavior in our people is enough to turn this into a crash.<p>It probably will not happen, but this is the environment that can create a crash. Traders should only consider buying if there is a very strong rally. Let’s hope that this is a bear trap and the start of a 2 week rally.<p>Even if it is, the mood of our country is so bleak and deep-seated that traders have to expect even a strong rally to fail. We are going lower. I have mentioned 40 – 50% as reasonable targets many times over the past 2 years. If today sells off, this bear trend will reach those targets quickly.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-sell-climax-at-support.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-16.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex sell climax at support\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a big rally and then 4 big bear days. Big Up, Big Down creates Big Confusion. That typically results in a trading range.<p>I said last week at the top of the buy climax that there would a 50% pullback to the EMA, the January 31 breakout point, and the March 3 buy climax low. Last week’s selloff reached those targets and therefore the bears will take profits. The bulls expect a 2nd leg sideways to up after their strong 2 week rally, but they want to make sure the selling has ended. They will wait for a 2nd reversal up. The bears expect a 2nd leg down from their strong selloff. Therefore, traders should expect sellers not far above Friday’s high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market tested Friday’s low overnight and reversed up. It broke above Friday’s high and pulled back.<p>This is trading range price action. Traders are betting that the 4 day bear trend will not get too far and that it is too early for the 2 week bull trend to resume. They are expecting reversals and a buying selloffs and selling rallies.<p>The overnight reversal was probably strong enough to that the overnight low will hold. However, it was not strong enough to make a big break above Friday’s high likely.<p>Traders expect a limit order market on the daily chart (reversals instead of breakouts). That usually results in lots of reversals on the 5 minute chart. The legs up and down for scalpers to make 20 – 30 pip scalps. Unless there is a surprise breakout up or down today, day traders will continue to scalp.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-limit-down-then-high-2-and-triangle-bottom-followed-by-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-16-1.png\" alt=\"Emini limit down then high 2 and triangle bottom followed by wedge top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up strongly from a test of the December 2018 low. However, after a wedge rally, it sold off again to below last week’s low.<p>The bulls are hoping that this is near the end of the selling. But, today had a bear body. It is therefore a weak buy signal bar for a double bottom and for a parabolic wedge sell climax. However, the odds still favor a strong short covering rally beginning this week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is the 2nd circuit breaker level. Instead of hitting the limit, it reversed up strongly.<p>The selloff was also a test of the December 2018 low. There is a parabolic wedge down to that low on the daily chart. The bulls wanted a reversal up from the double bottom and the parabolic wedge selloff.<p>Yesterday’s bear body makes yesterday a weak buy signal bar for today. However, a short covering rally will probably begin at some point this week.<h3>Possible rally, but still in bear trend</h3><p>It is important to remember that yesterday’s low was 31% below the all-time high. Once the S&amp;P cash index enters a bear market (closes down -20%), the final low is usually about a year later.<p>There is typically not a new all-time high until a couple years after that. Consequently, even if there is a rally that lasts many months, traders should still expect a test of yesterday’s low before there is a new all-time high.<h3>Can this selloff lead to a crash far below the December 2018 low?</h3><p>What happens if the Emini breaks strongly below the December 2018 low? Traders would see this selloff as comparable to the 1987 Crash. It could accelerate down in a series of big bear days.<p>That is unlikely. The selloff is hesitating at support. There is a parabolic wedge sell climax. That typically leads to profit taking.<p>Also, the American public is now clearer about the future. While it is depressing, it is less frightening and uncertain. They accept that the infection will be with us for the rest of the year and millions will get infected. It will continue to spread until there is a vaccine next year.<p>In addition, they now understand that the goal is to slow down the spread of coronavirus so that hospitals will not get overwhelmed. They have made the changes in their behavior.<p>Finally, the government is trying to stabilize the economy and support business and individuals. All of this will reduce the panic. Everyone will adjust to the new normal. That should soon lead to a trading range on the daily chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini was 5% limit up in the Globex session, but could not hold that level. It is now up less than 1%.<p>Yesterday was a reversal day. That is a type of a trading day. It was also the 3rd mostly sideways day. The Emini so far are holding the support of the December 2018 low.<p>If the bears continue to fail to break below that major support, they will take profits. Once traders decide that short covering is underway, the bears will buy back their shorts aggressively and the bulls will buy. This could result in a strong rally that could last a couple weeks and possibly a couple months. Therefore, there is an increased chance of big bull days beginning soon.<p>The bears have not given up yet. Therefore, there is still a 50% chance of a break below that December low within the next week. The bears might get a couple legs down, but probably not a protracted selloff below that support. It is important to note that a break below major support has a 50% chance of quickly reversing up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-limit-down-then-high-2-and-triangle-bottom-followed-by-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-17.png\" alt=\"Emini limit down then high 2 and triangle bottom followed by wedge top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That is the 2nd circuit breaker level. Instead of hitting the limit, it reversed up strongly.<p>The selloff was also a test of the December 2018 low. There is a parabolic wedge down to that low on the daily chart. The bulls wanted a reversal up from the double bottom and the parabolic wedge selloff.<p>Yesterday’s bear body makes yesterday a weak buy signal bar for today. However, a short covering rally will probably begin at some point this week.<h3>Possible rally, but still in bear trend</h3><p>It is important to remember that yesterday’s low was 31% below the all-time high. Once the S&amp;P cash index enters a bear market (closes down -20%), the final low is usually about a year later.<p>There is typically not a new all-time high until a couple years after that. Consequently, even if there is a rally that lasts many months, traders should still expect a test of yesterday’s low before there is a new all-time high.<h3>Can this selloff lead to a crash far below the December 2018 low?</h3><p>What happens if the Emini breaks strongly below the December 2018 low? Traders would see this selloff as comparable to the 1987 Crash. It could accelerate down in a series of big bear days.<p>That is unlikely. The selloff is hesitating at support. There is a parabolic wedge sell climax. That typically leads to profit taking.<p>Also, the American public is now clearer about the future. While it is depressing, it is less frightening and uncertain. They accept that the infection will be with us for the rest of the year and millions will get infected. It will continue to spread until there is a vaccine next year.<p>In addition, they now understand that the goal is to slow down the spread of coronavirus so that hospitals will not get overwhelmed. They have made the changes in their behavior.<p>Finally, the government is trying to stabilize the economy and support business and individuals. All of this will reduce the panic. Everyone will adjust to the new normal. That should soon lead to a trading range on the daily chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini was 5% limit up in the Globex session, but could not hold that level. It is now up less than 1%.<p>Yesterday was a reversal day. That is a type of a trading day. It was also the 3rd mostly sideways day. The Emini so far are holding the support of the December 2018 low.<p>If the bears continue to fail to break below that major support, they will take profits. Once traders decide that short covering is underway, the bears will buy back their shorts aggressively and the bulls will buy. This could result in a strong rally that could last a couple weeks and possibly a couple months. Therefore, there is an increased chance of big bull days beginning soon.<p>The bears have not given up yet. Therefore, there is still a 50% chance of a break below that December low within the next week. The bears might get a couple legs down, but probably not a protracted selloff below that support. It is important to note that a break below major support has a 50% chance of quickly reversing up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-limit-down-then-high-2-and-triangle-bottom-followed-by-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-17.png\" alt=\"Emini limit down then high 2 and triangle bottom followed by wedge top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday again tested the December 2018 low, and it again held above. In fact, yesterday’s low was above Monday’s low and its high was below Monday’s high. Therefore, yesterday was an inside day. Traders see it as a Breakout Mode day. It is both a buy and sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>While unlikely at the moment, today could be a 2nd consecutive inside day. If it is, it would increase the chance of a short covering rally beginning tomorrow.<p>However, the Emini has been locked down at the -5% limit in the Globex market. Today still might be an inside day, but the bulls have been unable to create a credible bottom on any time frame. The odds of another leg down on the daily chart have been increasing over the past few days.<p>What about the parabolic wedge sell climax on the daily chart? It will lead to a strong short covering rally. However, the sell climax can grow and grow before that rally begins. Until it begins, the sell climax is still growing.<p>The hesitation at just above the December 2017 low has made traders wonder if the rally will begin just above that low. It has not yet so there is nothing to buy unless a trader can trade small, use a very wide stop, and scale in lower.<h3>50% chance of one more big leg down</h3><p>The next target below the December 2017 low is a symbolic one. President Trump took office on January 20, 2017. The S&amp;P cash index opened at 2269.96 on that day. If the market falls below that level, it will be below it was when he took office. It will have given back all of the gains of more than 3 years.<p>There is a 50% chance of a break below the December 2018 low and a test of 2269.96 before there is a bear rally. In addition, there is currently a 30% chance that the Emini will break below 2000 before there is a 2 – 3 week bear rally.<p>Bear markets tend to fall until there is no left who is desperate to sell. It is impossible to know in advance if there are still a lot desperate longs who have not yet exited but unwilling to take much more pain.<p>If there are, the smart bulls and bears will know it and they will flush them out. Why should a smart bull buy now if he thinks he can soon buy lower? Also, why would a smart bear stop selling if he believes that there are a lot of weak bulls who will exit in a panic if the market falls just a little lower?<h3>This might turn into a Crash</h3><p>The Emini is locked limit down in the Globex session. If the day session falls 2% more, it will be locked limit down at -7%.<p>It almost hit the next circuit breaker on Tuesday at -13%. It it does today, traders will begin to refer to this bear market as a crash.<p>I have been trading since before the 1987 Crash. That was just one day. This developing Crash has already fallen more, and it has done more damage.<p>Starting in late 2017, I have been saying that the stock market would have at least a couple 40 – 50% selloffs staring before 2022. This selloff will probably be the 1st one. This is true even if the Emini reverses up strongly today. Traders should expect the emini to be lower 6 – 12 months from now.<p>When there is as much damage as there has been, the market will need years to heal. There will be strong rallies that last many months and possible a year or more. But, this is probably the start of a trading range that will last for a decade.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini will probably open below the Globex limit down level. It might even open 2% lower at -7%. That would trigger the 1st day session trading halt.<p>The danger of a crash today is real. If the Emini falls to -7%, it will probably break below the December low.<p>The January 20, 2017 open is only 3% below that. And the -13% limit level is only another 3% lower at around 2162 in the Emini. These levels are approximate because the CME calculates a theoretical closing price from yesterday. It is not exactly what you see on the chart.<p>The final trading halt comes at -20% at around 1988. That is below the 2000 Big Round Number, and about 41% down from the all-time high. If it is hit, trading stops for the rest of the day.<h3>Be very careful today</h3><p>The market has been making huge moves up and down. That will continue indefinitely. Today has the potential to have huge moves in either direction and in both directions. For example, a huge selloff could be the final flush and it could lead to a strong rally for the next several months.<p>Traders with small accounts should be very careful. They should go into the day expecting not to trade today. If they are thinking about buying, they must trade an extremely small position and only if the Emini is clearly strongly reversing up. Buying calls is a safer choice.<p>For the bears, it is always difficult to sell as a market is crashing. If a trader sells, he must trade very small. Also, he must get out if there is a strong reversal up. This is because there could be a violent bull trend reversal. If so, there may not be a pullback to where many bears would have shorted.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-then-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-18.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and then trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, it is still above the bottom of the 3 week bull trend reversal. Consequently, this selloff is more likely a bear leg in a trading range than a resumption of the 2 year bear trend.<p>With the crashing of the world financial markets over the past few weeks, there has been a flight to safety. The US is typically the least bad country during a crisis and investors tend to shift assets into dollars.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been selling off again overnight. But it was been sideways for the past 4 hours. The EURUSD broke below that range 15 minutes ago. However, a trading range is an area of agreement and a magnet. Therefore, there is at least a 50% chance of a reversal back up into that range this morning.<p>Can the EURUSD sell off strongly from here today? With two 60 pip rallies overnight, the EURUSD will probably not fall much further today. In fact, a 3rd rally to back above 1.10 is more likely.<p>Will today be a big bull trend day? After falling 130 pips from the overnight high, the best the bulls can probably get today is a reversal back up to the middle of the day’s range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-wedge-bottom-in-TR-Day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then wedge bottom in TR Day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today dipped down below the January 20, 2017 open. That is when Trump became president. The crash has erased all of the gains since he took office.<p>The bears took profits late in the day and today closed in the upper third. It is a weak buy signal for tomorrow. There is a 5 day wedge within a parabolic wedge on the daily chart. Traders expect a strong short covering rally to begin soon.<p>I was trading during the 1987 Crash. This one is worse. It is the most serious selloff since 1929. There is now tremendous damage to the market and most companies. They will need years to recover. Traders should expect a trading range for the next decade.<p>Sell climaxes can fall a long way before there is a strong short covering rally. Traders expect the selling to stop within a week or so.

Yesterday again tested the December 2018 low, and it again held above. In fact, yesterday’s low was above Monday’s low and its high was below Monday’s high. Therefore, yesterday was an inside day. Traders see it as a Breakout Mode day. It is both a buy and sell signal bar on the daily chart.<p>While unlikely at the moment, today could be a 2nd consecutive inside day. If it is, it would increase the chance of a short covering rally beginning tomorrow.<p>However, the Emini has been locked down at the -5% limit in the Globex market. Today still might be an inside day, but the bulls have been unable to create a credible bottom on any time frame. The odds of another leg down on the daily chart have been increasing over the past few days.<p>What about the parabolic wedge sell climax on the daily chart? It will lead to a strong short covering rally. However, the sell climax can grow and grow before that rally begins. Until it begins, the sell climax is still growing.<p>The hesitation at just above the December 2017 low has made traders wonder if the rally will begin just above that low. It has not yet so there is nothing to buy unless a trader can trade small, use a very wide stop, and scale in lower.<h3>50% chance of one more big leg down</h3><p>The next target below the December 2017 low is a symbolic one. President Trump took office on January 20, 2017. The S&amp;P cash index opened at 2269.96 on that day. If the market falls below that level, it will be below it was when he took office. It will have given back all of the gains of more than 3 years.<p>There is a 50% chance of a break below the December 2018 low and a test of 2269.96 before there is a bear rally. In addition, there is currently a 30% chance that the Emini will break below 2000 before there is a 2 – 3 week bear rally.<p>Bear markets tend to fall until there is no left who is desperate to sell. It is impossible to know in advance if there are still a lot desperate longs who have not yet exited but unwilling to take much more pain.<p>If there are, the smart bulls and bears will know it and they will flush them out. Why should a smart bull buy now if he thinks he can soon buy lower? Also, why would a smart bear stop selling if he believes that there are a lot of weak bulls who will exit in a panic if the market falls just a little lower?<h3>This might turn into a Crash</h3><p>The Emini is locked limit down in the Globex session. If the day session falls 2% more, it will be locked limit down at -7%.<p>It almost hit the next circuit breaker on Tuesday at -13%. It it does today, traders will begin to refer to this bear market as a crash.<p>I have been trading since before the 1987 Crash. That was just one day. This developing Crash has already fallen more, and it has done more damage.<p>Starting in late 2017, I have been saying that the stock market would have at least a couple 40 – 50% selloffs staring before 2022. This selloff will probably be the 1st one. This is true even if the Emini reverses up strongly today. Traders should expect the emini to be lower 6 – 12 months from now.<p>When there is as much damage as there has been, the market will need years to heal. There will be strong rallies that last many months and possible a year or more. But, this is probably the start of a trading range that will last for a decade.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini will probably open below the Globex limit down level. It might even open 2% lower at -7%. That would trigger the 1st day session trading halt.<p>The danger of a crash today is real. If the Emini falls to -7%, it will probably break below the December low.<p>The January 20, 2017 open is only 3% below that. And the -13% limit level is only another 3% lower at around 2162 in the Emini. These levels are approximate because the CME calculates a theoretical closing price from yesterday. It is not exactly what you see on the chart.<p>The final trading halt comes at -20% at around 1988. That is below the 2000 Big Round Number, and about 41% down from the all-time high. If it is hit, trading stops for the rest of the day.<h3>Be very careful today</h3><p>The market has been making huge moves up and down. That will continue indefinitely. Today has the potential to have huge moves in either direction and in both directions. For example, a huge selloff could be the final flush and it could lead to a strong rally for the next several months.<p>Traders with small accounts should be very careful. They should go into the day expecting not to trade today. If they are thinking about buying, they must trade an extremely small position and only if the Emini is clearly strongly reversing up. Buying calls is a safer choice.<p>For the bears, it is always difficult to sell as a market is crashing. If a trader sells, he must trade very small. Also, he must get out if there is a strong reversal up. This is because there could be a violent bull trend reversal. If so, there may not be a pullback to where many bears would have shorted.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-then-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-18.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and then trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-sell-climax-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-18-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex sell climax in trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been selling off strongly for 2 weeks. However, it is still above the bottom of the 3 week bull trend reversal. Consequently, this selloff is more likely a bear leg in a trading range than a resumption of the 2 year bear trend.<p>With the crashing of the world financial markets over the past few weeks, there has been a flight to safety. The US is typically the least bad country during a crisis and investors tend to shift assets into dollars.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been selling off again overnight. But it was been sideways for the past 4 hours. The EURUSD broke below that range 15 minutes ago. However, a trading range is an area of agreement and a magnet. Therefore, there is at least a 50% chance of a reversal back up into that range this morning.<p>Can the EURUSD sell off strongly from here today? With two 60 pip rallies overnight, the EURUSD will probably not fall much further today. In fact, a 3rd rally to back above 1.10 is more likely.<p>Will today be a big bull trend day? After falling 130 pips from the overnight high, the best the bulls can probably get today is a reversal back up to the middle of the day’s range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-wedge-bottom-in-TR-Day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then wedge bottom in TR Day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today dipped down below the January 20, 2017 open. That is when Trump became president. The crash has erased all of the gains since he took office.<p>The bears took profits late in the day and today closed in the upper third. It is a weak buy signal for tomorrow. There is a 5 day wedge within a parabolic wedge on the daily chart. Traders expect a strong short covering rally to begin soon.<p>I was trading during the 1987 Crash. This one is worse. It is the most serious selloff since 1929. There is now tremendous damage to the market and most companies. They will need years to recover. Traders should expect a trading range for the next decade.<p>Sell climaxes can fall a long way before there is a strong short covering rally. Traders expect the selling to stop within a week or so. Then, there will either be a bear rally or a trading range for several weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It also dipped below the open of January 20, 2017. That is the day Trump took office and therefore a magnet. The selloff has erased all of the stock market gains since he became president.<p>A reversal up from here would form an expanding triangle bottom with the February and December 2018 lows. But the month-long bear channel is tight and the bear trend is strong. Traders should only expect a bear rally. It could last several months and retrace more than half of the selloff, but it would still be a bear rally. The Emini will probably be in a trading range for several years.<p>There was some short covering late in the day yesterday and yesterday closed in the upper third of its range. It is a weak buy signal bar for today. The past 5 days formed a small wedge nested within a parabolic wedge sell climax. Yesterday had a bull body, but it did not close on its high. This is not a strong bottom, yet the market is very oversold. Traders expect a strong short covering rally soon.<p>However, the bear trend has been extremely strong. There might be one more plunge down to below 2000 before the bear rally begins.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 35 points in the Globex session. It therefore will probably open within yesterday’s range. Everyone knows that the bears have huge profits and that they will probably begin to take some profits soon. That would lead to a rally, which means several bull trend days.<p>But traders also know that surprises to the downside are common in bear trends. They therefore know that the bears could get another big trend day.<p>What is most likely today? Every day for the past month has had at least one swing trade up or down that lasted at least a couple hours. Yesterday had two. Day traders will expect that pattern to continue. If a swing up or down is particularly strong, it could last all day.<p>Because of the strong rallies and selloffs, traders should be open to anything and look for swing trades today. Less likely, the Emini will form a small trading range day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-wedge-bottom-in-TR-Day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-19.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then wedge bottom in TR Day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The break below the bottom of February’s strong rally ended the possibility of that surge being the start of a bull trend. Now, either the 2 year bear trend has resumed or the EURUSD is simply testing the bottom of its 8 month trading range.<p>The bulls will probably need at least a micro double bottom before they can get a 1 – 2 week rally. Consequently, traders will sell the 1st 1 – 3 day bounce.<p>It is interesting that the selloff finally closed the gap from 2017. The rally up at the February 20 low was a strong reversal up from just 1 pip above the bottom of that 2017 gap. Most gaps close. But when a market nearly closes a gap and reverses up strongly, then the gap is likely to stay open. Not here.<p>The bears want a measured move down based on the 700 pip height of the 8 month trading range. That would be a test of par (1.00). Furthermore, the EURUSD would be below the 2017 low. Traders would then conclude that the 2 year selloff was a bear trend and not just a protracted bull flag from the February 2018 high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off strongly overnight. It fell below the major support of the February low. That low as the start of a strong reversal up from a successful test of a gap on the daily chart from 2017.<p>For the bears, it’s mission accomplished. They have no need for the EURUSD to go any lower today. However, they want the day to close below the February 20 low of 1.0878. They therefore will sell any rally to around that level. In addition, they would like the day to close near its low.<p>The bulls know that the bears want a close below support. They also know that the support is currently 60 pips above the current price. In addition, they understand that there is often a pullback to the breakout point. They therefore will be looking to buy a reversal up today.<h3>Probably sideways to slightly up</h3><p>The bear trend has been in a tight bear channel for 4 hours. A strong trend like that typically has to transition into a trading range before there is a significant rally.<p>Over the past hour, the 5 minute chart was in a triangle. There was a small bear breakout and then a small reversal up.<p>Is this the start of a 50 pip rally to the breakout point? It might be. At a minimum, it creates confusion. Consequently, either the bulls have begun a minor reversal up or the hour-long trading range will continue. In either case, the bulls will buy dips. After such a big selloff overnight, the best the bulls can probably do today is get a rally above the breakout point and convert the bear trend into a trading range.<p>Because the overnight trend was strong and this reversal up so far is minor, the bears will sell rallies. However, there is no incentive for them to sell at the low. They will probably switch to scalping from swing trading.<p>Traders should expect either a trading range for the rest of the day or a drift up to the breakout point on the daily chart.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-reversal-up-from-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-19-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There is a 5 day micro wedge bottom nested within a month-long parabolic wedge sell climax. But, the Emini pulled back and entered a trading range.<p>The bears want the buy signal to fail. They want the sell climax to continue down to below the 2000 Big Round Number.<p>However, if the bulls begin to get 2 or 3 big bull bars closing on their highs, then a 2 – 3 week short covering rally will likely be underway.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance are important. The bears want the week to close on its low and below the December 2017 low.<p>In contrast, the bulls want the week to close above the open. It would then be a reversal bar and it would have a bull body. That would increase the chance that a short covering rally might begin next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There was a small bear breakout and then a small reversal up.<p>Is this the start of a 50 pip rally to the breakout point? It might be. At a minimum, it creates confusion. Consequently, either the bulls have begun a minor reversal up or the hour-long trading range will continue. In either case, the bulls will buy dips. After such a big selloff overnight, the best the bulls can probably do today is get a rally above the breakout point and convert the bear trend into a trading range.<p>Because the overnight trend was strong and this reversal up so far is minor, the bears will sell rallies. However, there is no incentive for them to sell at the low. They will probably switch to scalping from swing trading.<p>Traders should expect either a trading range for the rest of the day or a drift up to the breakout point on the daily chart.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-reversal-up-from-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-19-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There is a 5 day micro wedge nested within a month-long parabolic wedge sell climax. However, the bulls failed yesterday to get a big bull bar closing on its high. After a weak buy signal bar, yesterday was a disappointing entry bar.<p>There is an extreme sell climax at support. That support is the December 2018 low at the bottom of the 2 year trading range. The Emini also tested the open of January 20, 2017. That is when Trump became president.<p>Traders know that the bears will buy back shorts soon. Their profit taking will likely cause a strong short covering rally. It could last several weeks. But until the bulls get a couple big bull bars closing on their highs, the trend is still down.<p>There is a 40% chance of a collapse to 2000 within the next couple weeks. More likely, the stock market will soon either stop going down and enter a tight trading range or it will have a short covering rally.<h3>Importance of Friday’s close</h3><p>Today is Friday so it will affect the appearance of this week’s candlestick on the weekly chart. If the bulls get a close above the open, this week would be a bull reversal bar. That would increase the chance that the short covering rally will begin next week.<p>But the bears always want the opposite. They want the week to close below the December 2017 low and on the low of the week. Traders would then wonder if the Emini would collapse down below 2000 before there is a short covering rally.<p>Currently, the Emini is far from both prices. The next magnet then is the 2405 midpoint of the week. If the bulls get a close above 2405, that would make the week slightly more bullish than bearish. It would increase the chance that the bulls will get a rally next week. But if the bears get a close far below 2405, traders will think that there might be another leg down to 2000 by the end of the month.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini rallied overnight, but it has retraced most of that rally over the past 3 hours. It currently is trading just above the midpoint of the week on the day session. It might spend the day oscillating around that price, especially since it did that for most of yesterday.<p>With the huge days that the Emini has had for several weeks, there is an increased chance of a surprisingly big trend up or down. But since it has been sideways for 2 days at the support of the December 2018 low, today will probably be a trading range day. Then, in the final hour, traders will decide if the week will close below the 2342.25 December 2018 low or above the 2405 midpoint of the week. The close will affect the probabilities of either a continued bear trend or a short covering rally next week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-reversal-up-from-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20.png\" alt=\"Emini reversal up from sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Because of the new low, the bulls lost the argument that the March rally might be the start of a bull trend. With the new low, the bear trend has resumed.<p>But, every triangle, including an expanding triangle, is a trading range. If the EURUSD reverses up strongly from here within a couple weeks, the EURUSD will still be in its 8 month trading range as well as in a 2 year bear trend.<p>What traders are deciding is whether the selloff will continue down to par (1.00) this year. If the bears get consecutive bear bars closing below the February low, the odds of at least a small 2nd leg down will increase. That will make a resumption of the bear trend more likely than an expanding triangle bottom.<p>However, if the bulls get a strong reversal up, especially from a micro double bottom or small double bottom, traders will conclude that the current bear breakout will fail, just like the March bull breakout failed. They would then expect a continuation of the trading range and a rally back up to the middle at a minimum. The chart will give traders information over the next couple of weeks that will help them decide which is more likely.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market dipped below yesterday’s low overnight, rallied strongly, but then gave back more than half of the rally. The rally was a spike and channel bull trend. That typically evolves into a trading range. The EURUSD has been sideways for 4 hours.<p>Today is Friday and day traders will pay attention to weekly support and resistance. Not only do the bulls want today to have a bull body on the daily chart, they want the weekly chart to close above the February low. That is about 20 pips above the current price and certainly within reach.<p>Day traders have been scalping for 20 – 30 pips for several hours and will continue to do so unless there is a strong breakout up or down. Most likely, the trading range will continue for the rest of the day and the main fight will be whether the EURUSD will close above the February low.<p>The overnight rally makes it unlikely that the bears will get a 2nd consecutive bear day closing below the February low today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-spike-and-channel-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then spike and channel bear channel \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

At the end of the day, the Emini finally got back down to just below 2283.00. It closed slightly above. That was the price of the open of January 20, 2017 on the day President Trump assumed office. This tells you that the market might be sending a message of disapproval.<p>It does not matter that there is a parabolic wedge on the daily chart. The market wants to go down. Sell climaxes can fall very far before there is profit taking. There is no bottom yet and therefore traders should continue to expect lower prices. But, they have to be ready for a strong short covering rally to begin at any time.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It might have to test 2000 before a strong short covering rally will begin.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market has pulled back from an extreme buy climax. Traders expect a trading range for several months.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market made a new low in its 2 year bear trend. Consecutive bear bars closing below the February low make at least slightly lower prices likely.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Reversal down from extreme buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bond-Futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-buy-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20.png\" alt=\"Bond Futures weekly candlestick chart has buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures market has pulled back for the past 2 weeks from its most extreme buy climax in history on the weekly and monthly charts. This reversal will probably continue sideways to down for a few months. Typical minimum objectives are 2 legs sideways to down and about 10 bars.<p>When there is a Big Up and then a Big Down move, there is Big Confusion. Traders look for reversals because they do not believe moves up or down will lead to trends. Consequently, traders should expect a trading range, possible for several months.<p>A reversal from a buy climax usually tests to the bottom of the most recent climactic rally. On the weekly chart, that is the low of those 3 big bull bars in the move up to last week’s top. That low is around 161. The top is usually around a lower high. On the daily chart (not shown), there was a lower high around 184. Consequently, the trading range might be between 160 and 185, which is huge.<p>If the likely trading range begins to form, many traders will look for fast money trades. This means the equivalent of scalps that last 1 – 5 bars (weeks, since this is a weekly chart). They will buy reversals up from just above 160 – 165 and sell reversals down from 180 – 185. They will then take profits around the middle of the range.<h3>Can the 2 week pullback be a bull flag?</h3><p>Trends continue much longer than what seems reasonable. However, at some point, something happens that makes it likely that the trend has paused or ended. This strong reversal down from the extreme buy climax is enough to end the bull trend, at least for about 10 bars and 2 legs sideways to down.<p>At that point, if the bears have been unable to create a trend down, the bulls will start to buy again. They want the pullback to be a pause in the bull trend instead of the end of the trend. The bull trend probably will not attempt to resume up to a new high for at least a couple months.<h3>Buy climax also on the monthly chart</h3><p>The buy climax is also extreme on the monthly chart. If this month closes below the open, it will be a bear reversal candlestick on the monthly chart. Traders will then look for about ten bars and 2 legs sideways to down on that chart as well. That means about a year. The target on that chart is the bottom of the most recent climactic leg up. That is the January low around 154.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Break to new low in 2 year bear trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-bull-trap-but-pssible-expanding-triangle-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex bull trap but possible expanding triangle bottom\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart collapsed over the past 2 weeks after breaking above the 2 year bear channel. For the past year, I have mentioned many times that there was a gap above the April 7, 2017 high and that it was a potential magnet. The EURUSD low in February was 1 pip above the bottom of the gap.<p>There was then a strong rally to above the 2 year bear channel. Traders correctly concluded that the gap was successfully tested and the bear trend had ended. The weekly chart was either in a bull trend or a trading range as of 2 weeks ago.<p>With this week falling below the February low, the EURUSD made a new low in its 2 year bear trend. But it could also still be forming a slightly lower low in its 8 month trading range. If there is a strong reversal up within a couple weeks, the EURUSD would be back to the middle of its 8 month trading range. It would therefore be more neutral, although slightly bearish after this week’s new low.<p>It is important to note that if the EURUSD weekly chart next week has a bear body and a 2nd consecutive close below the February low, traders will expect a 2nd leg down after the first 1 – 3 week bounce.<p>Furthermore, they will look for the selloff to reach the next support. That is the January 2017 low of 1.0340. If the EURUSD broke below that, the next support is at par (1.00).<h3>Is this week’s bear break a bear trap?</h3><p>What if next week’s candlestick has a bull body closing above the February low, or even at the high of the week? Traders will then suspect that this week’s breakout might fail. It might be a bear trap and the 3rd leg down in an expanding triangle. The 1st two bottoms were the October and February low.<p>Any triangle is a trading range. Therefore, even though the EURUSD broke below a horizontal trading range, it is still possibly in an expanding triangle, which is also a trading range. However, on the daily chart (not shown), both Thursday and Friday were bear bars that closed below the February low. That makes at least slightly lower prices likely next week.<p>If the bulls next week get 1 or 2 bull bars on the daily chart, especially big bull bars closing near their highs, traders would suspect that the March breakout was a bear trap and the the 8 month trading range was still intact. That rally would reduce the chance of a move down to par.<p>At the moment, the odds favor lower prices. They will change depending on what next week does.<h2>Impact of Coronavirus pandemic</h2><p>Last month, when there were not even 100 cases of coronavirus in the US, I said that it was going to be a huge disaster. I said that between 30 and 60% of the country would probably be infected and that millions could die.<p>Although I am an eye surgeon, I had a subspecialty that included infectious diseases. I did not see how a pandemic was avoidable. The early data showed that the average patient infected 3 people and that the number of cases was doubling every 3 – 6 days. If you do the math, that means 1 person, then 3 people, then 9, etc. Within a few months, that exponential growth meant millions of infections.<p>Furthermore, there is no effective treatment and a vaccine is at least a year a way. That is why I said that 3 billion people worldwide could ultimately be infected and this was probably going to be the worst pandemic since 1919.<h3>Herd immunity</h3><p>Life is going to change again in a month or two. The number of infections in the US will soon be in the millions and probably tens of millions. The odds are very high that a person cannot catch it again. Therefore, all of those people who recovered will be immune. They will no longer have restrictions because they cannot catch it and cannot spread it.<p>Once we reach some magic number of recovered patients, there will be fewer people to spread the virus. This is called herd immunity. For many virus outbreaks, true herd immunity, enough to prevent an epidemic, is about 95% of the population. That is not going to happen with the coronavirus. But once about 10% of the population recovers and is immune, restrictions will get less for everyone. This will continue to improve until there is a vaccine. At that point, life will be back to normal.<p>I think it is helpful to look at the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1919. It began in the spring. As summer came, the number of new cases started to shrink. People thought the pandemic ended. But then in the fall, the flu returned and was as bad as it was in the spring. Yes, I think the immediate crisis will be getting a little better by the end of May. But it is a mistake to assume that the pandemic has ended until after there is a vaccine next year.<p>I want to make one final point. Everyone assumes there will be a vaccine, like for the flu and measles. It is important to remember that there is no vaccine for HIV, which is a virus. While unlikely, scientists might discover that they cannot create an effective vaccine for the coronavirus either.<h3>Many heroes</h3><p>I think that the governors have been bold, courageous, and proactive. They have done a great job in leading us through this and creating our path forward.<p>Unfortunately, their isolation plans will not stop the inevitable. About half of all Americans will get infected. But their plans will slow the growth rate and that will save lives. There are not enough ventilators to treat a surge in patients. If the healthcare system gets overwhelmed like it did in Italy, far more people will die.<p>I want to also say that many people are doing great things to help all of us. Farmers, truckers, grocery and pharmacy store workers, everyone at any medical facility, anyone whose job requires them to be exposed to the public, and even all of the Americans who are simply doing their jobs and trying to avoid getting infected, and especially trying hard to not infect others.<p>There has not been a national challenge like this since World War II. It was easy to assume that we did such a great job building our society that we would never face a national crisis of this scale. Life humbles everyone at some point, including societies that have enjoyed their hubris. But despite the hardship, it is nice to be reminded of how good people can be.<h3>Economic impact: We are in a recession</h3><p>There are many ways to determine if an economy is in a recession. The most widely used is to look at the GDP growth rate. If it falls for 2 consecutive quarters, the economy is shrinking. The news will declare that we are in a recession. But that diagnosis comes about 6 months after the recession began.<p>We see that the economy is shrinking. Everyone has cancelled hotel, air, and cruise reservations, and no one is going to restaurants or the mall. Consumer spending is way down and millions of people are getting laid off. Unemployment could reach 10% or more. We are in a recession. The country is making much less money and there is no reason to think that it will expand again for many months.<p>America is still in shock. This will last for a couple more months. When do we know that a big bear rally will begin? I will use toilet paper as a barometer. When Walmart and Costco start having toilet paper again, then America is less scared. That should lead to a bear rally, which could last many months.<h3>A bear market has consequences that last a long time</h3><p>The S&amp;P entered a bear market last week when it closed 20% below the all-time highest close. When there is a bear market, the final low typically comes about a year later. If there is a strong rally within the next couple months that is similar to the one in 2019, traders will assume that it will form a lower high. It will not be a resumption of the bull trend. Expect at least one more new low in about a year.<p>In addition, that new low will probably be 40 – 50% below the old high. That means there would have to be a 50 – 100% rally to get back to the old high. On average, it takes 2 years to get to the old high.<p>However, I talk about some technical factors below that are problems for the bulls. The economy will probably be stagnant for a decade. It will be difficult for the market to get much above the current high for many years.<h3>There are bigger problems than the pandemic</h3><p>I keep making the point that the 2017 extreme buy climax and the chaos over the last 2 years meant that the economy had very serious problems. This is true despite stock pundits and politicians continuing to claim the market would continue a lot higher. The market was telling us for 2 years that it believed the late stages of the rally were created by unsustainable manipulation rather than corporate earnings. The government and industry could not figure out how to continue the fake bull trend.<p>The pandemic was the straw that broke the camel’s back. But that poor camel was already carrying too much and it was just a matter of time before its back was going to break.<h3>The pandemic will be over in about a year, but then what?</h3><p>You hear politicians and economists say that the economy is strong and it will roar back as soon as the pandemic ends within a year. That is because they do not know how to read charts.<p>Yes, in a few years, the coronavirus will no longer be a problem. Suppose that I am right and the stock market is unable to make a significant new high for many years. I bet it will be a decade. What then will the experts say?<p>They will look back at today and come up with all kinds of reasons to explain that the 12 year bull trend was not based on strong fundamentals. Many will claim that everyone knew that the economy was actually weak, despite the strong stock market. They will explain it by pointing to the Fed’s interventions, stock buybacks, low interest rates, and just about anything else imaginable.<p>I have a simpler explanation. The most extreme buy climax in history should lead to a decade long trading range, just like every other extreme buy climax did. The charts told us that price got too far ahead of fundamentals. That is the only absolutely certain fact. Any other explanation is sophistry.<h3>Price is truth</h3><p>There were countless factors that contributed to the buy climax, but who cares? It is impossible and useless to know how much each factor contributed to the buy climax. I’m in this for the money. Those discussions do not help me achieve my goal. All I am interested in is what the charts are saying. Price is truth.<p>The market will be a trader’s market for a long time, which means it will disappoint buy and hold investors. It will take a decade before the fundamentals catch up to price, allowing the bull trend to resume.<h2><strong>Yearly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong>Outside down</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SP500-cash-index-formed-outside-down-candlestick-in-2020-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20-2.png\" alt=\"S&amp;P500 cash index formed outside down candlestick in 2020\"></a></figure><p>On a yearly chart, each bar is one year.

It has now also traded below last year’s low. Consequently, 2020 is an outside down bar on the yearly chart. That is a sell signal bar for next year. It will have a higher probability of leading to lower prices if this year closes near its low and below the 2019 low.<h3>What happens after an outside down bar?</h3><p>When there is a big outside down bar (here, year), usually the next year is not a big bear bar. This is especially true when it comes in a strong bull trend, like we’ve had since 2009. More often, it trades below the low of the outside down bar to trigger the sell signal, but it becomes a weak entry bar. If it closes near its high, it is a High 1 buy signal bar for the next year.<p>Sometimes the bar after an outside down bar is an inside bar. That means that next year’s low would be above this year’s low and its high would be below this year’s high. There would then be an ioi pattern (inside-outside-inside), which is a Breakout Mode pattern. The entry up or down would come in the following year, which would be 2022. This is getting too far ahead, but it is helpful to think about it.<p>There is one other point to remember. If 2021 is an inside bar, or if it trades below this year’s low and then rallies, it will overlap a lot of this year’s range. In both cases, there would then be 3 sideways bars on the yearly chart.<p>I have made the point repeatedly over the past 2 years that the stock market will probably be in a trading range for about a decade. Three sideways bars is the start of a small trading range.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Break below 2 year trading range and 11 year bull trend line</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-monthly-candlestick-chart-breaking-below-2-year-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20-3.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly candlestick chart breaking below 2 year trading range\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;this month so far has a big bear body. It has broken below the 11 year bull trend line and the bottom of the 2 year trading range.<p>There are 7 trading days left in March. They can change the appearance of this month’s candlestick. Depending on how the month closes, April could be bullish or bearish.<p>The bull trend line is currently around 2600. If the bulls get a reversal up to above that trend line, there would be a big tail on the bottom of the March candlestick. While consecutive big bear bodies make a 2nd leg sideways to down likely, a big tail reduces the chance of a big selloff in April. Traders will wonder if the Emini was finding support at the December 2018 low. That is the bottom of the 2 year range.<p>A big tail would reduce the chance of April falling below the March low. Furthermore, it would increase the chance of the Emini trading sideways to up for the next month or two.<p>Traders saw the 11 year bull trend line and that December 2018 low as major support. Also, the stock market often bounces when it falls 10, 20, 30, or 50%. These numbers are therefore additional support. A 30% selloff is particularly important because that is the average lowest selloff when the Emini enters a bear market.<h3>Emini testing major support</h3><p>The lowest close this week for the S&amp;P cash index was on Friday. It was 32% below the all-time highest close of February 19. That is about a 30% correction. Consequently, this week tested all 3 support levels (the bottom of the 2 year trading range, the 11 year bull trend line, and a 30% pullback level).<p>Traders are deciding it the bears will begin to cover their shorts around the current support and if strong bulls will start to buy, expecting a short covering rally. If there is strong short covering, this month could close back above the bull trend line, which is around 2600.<p>If the month closes on its low, it will also close below the December 2018 low. Traders would see that low as a breakout point. Since the 2 year trading range is about 1000 points tall, they will wonder if there would be a measured move down to around 1300.<p>That would be a 62% correction. There is only a 20% chance of that at the moment. The best the bears can probably get before a short covering rally is a test of the bottom of the 2014-2015 trading range at around 1800. That would represent almost a 50% correction. There is a 30% chance of the Emini reaching that before there is a bear rally.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Testing the price at the start of President’s Trump’s term in office</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-weekly-candlestick-chart-breaking-below-2-year-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20-4.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly candlestick chart breaking below 2 year trading range\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed its 5th consecutive big bear bar this week. Furthermore, it closed below the December 2018 low, which was the bottom of a 2 year trading range.<p>If the bulls get a reversal up within the next few weeks, that low would be the 3rd leg down in an expanding triangle. The 1st two are the February and December 2018 lows. Traders would then expect a rally back to at least the middle of the 2 year triangle. That would retrace about half of the bear trend.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Small Pullback Bear Trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-daily-candlestick-chart-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20-5.png\" alt=\"Emini daily candlestick chart small pullback bear trend\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is in a sell climax. Sell climaxes can fall far further than what seems reasonable. There is no reversal up yet. Traders on Wall St. sometimes say something like, “Being cheap is a bad timing tool.” Just because the market seems cheap, it can get much cheaper, and it is not necessarily a good time to buy. In fact, when the market collapses, it still might actually be expensive based on the new economic conditions. You will know in hindsight if it falls a lot more.<p>The first leg down was a huge break below the 4 month bull trend line on the daily chart. It was a spike down to the February 28 low. There was then a 3 day pullback to the March 3 high and then a resumption of the bear trend.<p>The March 3 high was the start of a parabolic wedge bear channel. That is a tight bear channel with at least 3 pushes (sell climaxes) down. This selloff had 5 brief legs down. The last 3 were over 5 days and formed a micro wedge bottom. It was nested into the end of the 2 week parabolic wedge sell climax. A nested wedge selloff has a higher probability of leading to a reversal up.<h3>Reversing all of the gains of the Trump Presidency</h3><p>The Emini dipped below the January 20, 2017 open on Wednesday and reversed up. On Friday, it fell below it again, but closed just a little bit above. That was the start of the Trump presidency. Therefore, the stock market has almost erased all of its gains since President Trump took office. The cash index has not quite reached its open from that day. Trades can read into it whatever they want, but the market is clearly paying attention to the start of his presidency.<h3>Bulls want signs of buying pressure</h3><p>While this week had several bull days, they all had small bodies. Also, there were no consecutive big bull bars closing on their highs. Traders want to see that before concluding that a short covering rally is underway. The bears who did not yet buy back their shorts will buy in a panic. The bulls will buy as well.<p>Both the bulls and bears know that a short covering rally in an extreme sell climax typically has at least a couple legs sideways to up. They also expect it to last about 10 bars or more.<p>Because this selloff was particularly severe, the short covering rally could last a lot longer than 2 weeks. A logical target would be around 3000. That is a Big Round Number and it was resistance several times in 2018 and 2019.<h3>Can this be a V bottom, like in January 2019?</h3><p>No. First of all, only about 20% of sell climaxes immediately reverse up into a bull trend. Therefore V bottoms are rare, which means that any upcoming bottom will probably not be like the one from last year.<p>If the upcoming short covering rally will not be the resumption of the 12 year bull trend, what will happen? There might be a rally for a month or two that would be a credible start of a V bottom reversal. However, there is an 80% chance that the rally would be minor. A minor reversal is one that does not lead to an opposite trend.<p>It is either a bull leg in a trading range or a bear flag. In either case, traders should expect a test of the bottom of the current sell climax. When there is a test, there is often a rally from a double bottom. That has a 40% chance of beginning bull trend.<h3>Extreme buy climaxes lead to extreme trading ranges</h3><p>This month-long selloff is extremely strong. It is similar to the 1st leg down in the 1929 Crash. There was then a 2nd leg down. And then a 3rd, and many more legs down. The bear trend did not end until the stock market lost almost 90% of its value. While there might be a wedge selloff (3 legs down) over then next year and the market will probably lose at least 40% of its value, it will not lose 90%.<p>Starting at the end of 2017, I repeatedly said that the late 2017 rally was the most extreme in the 100+ years of the stock market. I said that it would lead to a pullback for many months. But I also said every pullback was just that, which is a pause in a bull trend. Traders should expect higher prices to follow every pullback. Additionally, I said many times that the buy climax was coming late in a bull trend and that there would probably be a major top within a few years.<p>Finally, I often compared it to the rallies in the 1960’s and 1990’s. Both led to trading ranges that lasted about 10 years. Each also had at least a couple pullbacks of 40% or more. I therefore said that the 2020’s would probably be in a trading range for a decade and that there would be at least a couple 40 – 50% pullbacks.<h3>Trading range likely to last about a decade</h3><p>This selloff is a likely start of a decade long trading range. The bulls typically get a new high about 2 years after a bear trend ends. On average a bear trend lasts about a year. Consequently, there might be a new all-time high in about 3 years. However, it will probably not get far above this February’s high. It would just be a bear leg in a developing 10 year trading range. Traders should then expect another 40+% selloff from that high.<h2>What to expect next week</h2><p>The daily chart is in a parabolic wedge sell climax. That is also a Small Pullback Bear Trend. There is no sign of a bottom. Traders continue to expect lower prices.<p>The next target is the 2000 Big Round Number. But a strong short covering rally can begin at any time. You will know it when you see it because the buying will be obvious and relentless. Until then, the bear trend will still continue down.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There is a 5 day micro wedge nested within a month-long parabolic wedge sell climax. However, the bulls failed yesterday to get a big bull bar closing on its high. After a weak buy signal bar, yesterday was a disappointing entry bar.<p>There is an extreme sell climax at support. That support is the December 2018 low at the bottom of the 2 year trading range. The Emini also tested the open of January 20, 2017. That is when Trump became president.<p>Traders know that the bears will buy back shorts soon. Their profit taking will likely cause a strong short covering rally. It could last several weeks. But until the bulls get a couple big bull bars closing on their highs, the trend is still down.<p>There is a 40% chance of a collapse to 2000 within the next couple weeks. More likely, the stock market will soon either stop going down and enter a tight trading range or it will have a short covering rally.<h3>Importance of Friday’s close</h3><p>Today is Friday so it will affect the appearance of this week’s candlestick on the weekly chart. If the bulls get a close above the open, this week would be a bull reversal bar. That would increase the chance that the short covering rally will begin next week.<p>But the bears always want the opposite. They want the week to close below the December 2017 low and on the low of the week. Traders would then wonder if the Emini would collapse down below 2000 before there is a short covering rally.<p>Currently, the Emini is far from both prices. The next magnet then is the 2405 midpoint of the week. If the bulls get a close above 2405, that would make the week slightly more bullish than bearish. It would increase the chance that the bulls will get a rally next week. But if the bears get a close far below 2405, traders will think that there might be another leg down to 2000 by the end of the month.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini rallied overnight, but it has retraced most of that rally over the past 3 hours. It currently is trading just above the midpoint of the week on the day session. It might spend the day oscillating around that price, especially since it did that for most of yesterday.<p>With the huge days that the Emini has had for several weeks, there is an increased chance of a surprisingly big trend up or down. But since it has been sideways for 2 days at the support of the December 2018 low, today will probably be a trading range day. Then, in the final hour, traders will decide if the week will close below the 2342.25 December 2018 low or above the 2405 midpoint of the week. The close will affect the probabilities of either a continued bear trend or a short covering rally next week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-reversal-up-from-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20.png\" alt=\"Emini reversal up from sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-expanding-triangle-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex expanding triangle sell climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has had increasing big moves up and down. Because of the new low, the bulls lost the argument that the March rally might be the start of a bull trend. With the new low, the bear trend has resumed.<p>But, every triangle, including an expanding triangle, is a trading range. If the EURUSD reverses up strongly from here within a couple weeks, the EURUSD will still be in its 8 month trading range as well as in a 2 year bear trend.<p>What traders are deciding is whether the selloff will continue down to par (1.00) this year. If the bears get consecutive bear bars closing below the February low, the odds of at least a small 2nd leg down will increase. That will make a resumption of the bear trend more likely than an expanding triangle bottom.<p>However, if the bulls get a strong reversal up, especially from a micro double bottom or small double bottom, traders will conclude that the current bear breakout will fail, just like the March bull breakout failed. They would then expect a continuation of the trading range and a rally back up to the middle at a minimum. The chart will give traders information over the next couple of weeks that will help them decide which is more likely.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market dipped below yesterday’s low overnight, rallied strongly, but then gave back more than half of the rally. The rally was a spike and channel bull trend. That typically evolves into a trading range. The EURUSD has been sideways for 4 hours.<p>Today is Friday and day traders will pay attention to weekly support and resistance. Not only do the bulls want today to have a bull body on the daily chart, they want the weekly chart to close above the February low. That is about 20 pips above the current price and certainly within reach.<p>Day traders have been scalping for 20 – 30 pips for several hours and will continue to do so unless there is a strong breakout up or down. Most likely, the trading range will continue for the rest of the day and the main fight will be whether the EURUSD will close above the February low.<p>The overnight rally makes it unlikely that the bears will get a 2nd consecutive bear day closing below the February low today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-spike-and-channel-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then spike and channel bear channel \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

At the end of the day, the Emini finally got back down to just below 2283.00. It closed slightly above. That was the price of the open of January 20, 2017 on the day President Trump assumed office. This tells you that the market might be sending a message of disapproval.<p>It does not matter that there is a parabolic wedge on the daily chart. The market wants to go down. Sell climaxes can fall very far before there is profit taking. There is no bottom yet and therefore traders should continue to expect lower prices. But, they have to be ready for a strong short covering rally to begin at any time.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It closed just above the January 20, 2017 open. That is the day President Trump assumed office. The market is clearly paying attention to that price. It reversed up overnight from below that price.<p>Traders expect a strong short covering rally to begin soon. This selloff might fall to the next support at 2000 before the bears take some profits and the bulls stop dumping their stock.<p>There will probably be a strong short covering rally beginning within a couple weeks. It might begin today. The bear trend, however will last all year at a minimum.<h3>Is the end of the 1st leg down on the daily chart?</h3><p>If the bulls get 2 or 3 big bull trend days this week, then yes. However, the daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. There have been several big bull days over the past few weeks. The bulls have not been able to create more than a 2 day pullback since the bear trend began.<p>Traders will only see this as a short-term low if the bounce grows to at least 3 or 4 days this week. Otherwise, they will look for another leg down.<h3>Infection rate should slow by end of April</h3><p>At some point, enough people will have changed their behavior so that the number of new cases will be less than the number of people getting better. That means that there will be a peak in the number of active infections. Patients newly diagnosed have infected people for two weeks before their diagnosis. Clearly, lots of people are changing their behavior right now. Therefore, the peak will probably come in late April.<p>It is important to note that stock prices are based anticipated future earnings. Therefore, the short term bottom will come before the peak in active infections is reached. If the infection rate falls by the end of April, the short covering will probably begin within the next couple weeks. If the bear rally does not begin soon, it will likely mean that the peak of infections will come after April.<p>The Spanish Flu in 1918 had a peak in the spring. However, there was a resurgence in the fall. A second or third surge often happens with pandemics. Consequently, there probably will be another surge in the fall. There might even be a 3rd one before there is a vaccine next year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini repeatedly bounced up from -5% limit down overnight. It has rallied strongly over the past 30 minutes. The Fed’s promise to print as much money as needed and Congress’s action on a rescue plan are increasing the confidence of the bulls and making bears begin to take windfall profits.<p>Today could be a short-term bottom. Because the daily chart is in a parabolic wedge sell climax, a rally could easily last a couple weeks. It could even last a couple months.<p>Day traders today will be looking for swing trades up if the rally continues. The bulls will buy pullbacks and strong breakouts. The bears will wait to sell until after the chart enters a trading range.<h3>A ledge is a magnet</h3><p>It is important to note that the limit down trading overnight created a ledge bottom in the Globex market. A ledge bottom is a tight trading range with at least 4 bars having exactly the same low. This ledge is also present on the 60 minute chart.<p>Markets usually test below ledges before there is a bull trend. The test usually comes within 100 – 150 bars. On the 60 minute chart, that would be a few weeks.<p>Consequently, traders should assume that any rally from here will probably dip below the overnight low within a few weeks. But even if it did not, the odds are that there would be at least one more new low within a year. The final low in a bear trend typically comes about a year after it begins.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-spike-and-channel-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-23.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then spike and channel bear channel \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

The bulls hope that the 2 week collapse was just a sell climax test of the bottom of the 8 week trading range and of the April 2017 gap.<p>There was a 3 day spike down from the March 9 high. Then, there was a 3 day collapse to a new low. That is a type of parabolic wedge sell climax, which usually attracts profit takers.<p>There will be a short covering rally soon. It might begin today. Once it begins, the 1st target is the EMA.<p>Traders will expect it to last a week or two. They then expect a test down. If there is a 2nd reversal up, there would be a double bottom. That would have a better chance of halting the bear trend and maintaining the 8 month trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up over the past hour after falling 2 pips below Friday’s low overnight. So far, today is a bull trend reversal day.<p>Because of the location and the sell climax on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of a rally lasting a week or more. That increases the chance of several bull trend days this week. If so, traders will find it easier to make money buying breakouts and pullbacks than selling rallies.<p>If today enters a trading range, the bears will be more willing to sell. Also, the bulls will switch to scalping from swing trading.<p>Can the rally over the past hour be a bull trap. Not likely. Traders would need to see a break below the overnight low before concluding that the bears had retaken control of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-Trading-range-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Trading range open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It closed just above the January 20, 2017 open. That is the day President Trump assumed office. The market is clearly paying attention to that price. It reversed up overnight from below that price.<p>Traders expect a strong short covering rally to begin soon. This selloff might fall to the next support at 2000 before the bears take some profits and the bulls stop dumping their stock.<p>There will probably be a strong short covering rally beginning within a couple weeks. It might begin today. The bear trend, however will last all year at a minimum.<h3>Is the end of the 1st leg down on the daily chart?</h3><p>If the bulls get 2 or 3 big bull trend days this week, then yes. However, the daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. There have been several big bull days over the past few weeks. The bulls have not been able to create more than a 2 day pullback since the bear trend began.<p>Traders will only see this as a short-term low if the bounce grows to at least 3 or 4 days this week. Otherwise, they will look for another leg down.<h3>Infection rate should slow by end of April</h3><p>At some point, enough people will have changed their behavior so that the number of new cases will be less than the number of people getting better. That means that there will be a peak in the number of active infections. Patients newly diagnosed have infected people for two weeks before their diagnosis. Clearly, lots of people are changing their behavior right now. Therefore, the peak will probably come in late April.<p>It is important to note that stock prices are based anticipated future earnings. Therefore, the short term bottom will come before the peak in active infections is reached. If the infection rate falls by the end of April, the short covering will probably begin within the next couple weeks. If the bear rally does not begin soon, it will likely mean that the peak of infections will come after April.<p>The Spanish Flu in 1918 had a peak in the spring. However, there was a resurgence in the fall. A second or third surge often happens with pandemics. Consequently, there probably will be another surge in the fall. There might even be a 3rd one before there is a vaccine next year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini repeatedly bounced up from -5% limit down overnight. It has rallied strongly over the past 30 minutes. The Fed’s promise to print as much money as needed and Congress’s action on a rescue plan are increasing the confidence of the bulls and making bears begin to take windfall profits.<p>Today could be a short-term bottom. Because the daily chart is in a parabolic wedge sell climax, a rally could easily last a couple weeks. It could even last a couple months.<p>Day traders today will be looking for swing trades up if the rally continues. The bulls will buy pullbacks and strong breakouts. The bears will wait to sell until after the chart enters a trading range.<h3>A ledge is a magnet</h3><p>It is important to note that the limit down trading overnight created a ledge bottom in the Globex market. A ledge bottom is a tight trading range with at least 4 bars having exactly the same low. This ledge is also present on the 60 minute chart.<p>Markets usually test below ledges before there is a bull trend. The test usually comes within 100 – 150 bars. On the 60 minute chart, that would be a few weeks.<p>Consequently, traders should assume that any rally from here will probably dip below the overnight low within a few weeks. But even if it did not, the odds are that there would be at least one more new low within a year. The final low in a bear trend typically comes about a year after it begins.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-wedge-top-and-then-spike-and-channel-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-23.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and then spike and channel bear channel \"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Yesterday’s low was a 34% pullback from the high That is extremely unusual for a sell climax. Traders therefore expect a big short covering rally to begin soon.<p>The Fed made it clear that it will print as much money as needed to protect the economy. Traders expect Congress to pass rescue legislation this week. Finally, the American public is adjusting to the new normal. These factors will probably slow the selling.<p>Once traders sense that the selling is drying up, they will start to buy. The bears will begin to cover shorts and many bulls will start to buy what many now see as a cheap market. This should create a short covering rally.<p>Since the selloff has been extreme, the short covering could be surprisingly big. Furthermore, it could last for months instead of just a couple weeks.<p>The selloff has been in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. There are still targets below. Every reversal attempt failed in one or two days. Can the bulls get a 3 day rally? If they do, traders will be more confident that the 1st leg might have ended.<p>It is important to remember that the rally will be in a bear market. The final low typically comes about a year after the bear trend began. Therefore, the best the bulls can probably get over the next several months is a bull leg in a trading range and not a resumption of the bull trend. On average, there is no new high until about 3 years after a bear market begins.<h3>Can the bulls get March to close above the December 2018 low?</h3><p>There is about a week left to the month. The month so far is a huge bear bar. Most big bear trend bars have a tail on the bottom.<p>This means that there probably will be some buying before the end of the month. The 1st goal for the bulls is to get the month to close back above the December 2018 low of 2343.25. That will tend to limit the selling going into the end of the month.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini rallied repeated to the 5% limit up level over the past few hours. However, it has been unable to stay there.<p>This is similar to yesterday’s Globex session being unable to stay limit down. That was followed by a trading range day.<p>Will today be another trading range day? Most days over the past 2 weeks have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Traders will expect that again today.<p>With the Emini hitting limit up in the Globex session, today will probably not be a big bear trend day. There is an increased chance of a bull trend day. The odds are not as high as they would have been if the Emini did not pull back from being limit up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-Trading-range-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-24.png\" alt=\"Emini Trading range open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is in an expanding triangle. However, the bulls need a strong reversal up to convince traders that the 8 month trading range is intact. Without that, the bears will try to continue the 2 year bear trend down to par (1.00).<p>Friday and Monday formed a micro double bottom in a sell climax. Because they were doji candlesticks, they lack conviction for the bulls. That makes them weak buy signal bars. However, traders expect a short covering rally soon.<p>By today going above yesterday’s high, the EURUSD triggered a weak buy signal. Since the 2 week selloff has been climactic, the 1st reversal up will probably be minor. A minor reversal means that it becomes either a bear flag or a bull leg in what will end up as a trading range. There is only a 30% chance of a major reversal into a bull trend without at least a double bottom.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high. This triggered a minor buy signal on the daily chart. However, the rally only went slightly above yesterday’s high before pulling back. This is a weak bull breakout.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways for 6 hours. Day traders have been scalping for about 20 pips. There is no sign that this is about to end.<p>The bulls would like today to close far above yesterday’s high. But they would be satisfied with it closing just a little above that high.<p>The bears want the day to close on its low. It would then be a stronger Low 1 sell signal bar for tomorrow. Their minimum goal is a close below yesterday’s high. They would like a close below the open so that today would be a more reliable sell signal bar for tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-24-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls got a rally for a couple hours. There was then a deep pullback and the day entered a trading range. Since today closed near its high, there is an increased chance of higher prices tomorrow.<p>While the bulls hope that today will be the start of a short covering rally, the day was not particularly strongly bullish. Furthermore, the daily chart is still in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. So far, today is just a 1 day pullback.<p>But if the bulls can get 2 – 3 or more consecutive bull days, especially with big bodies, traders will look for a trading range over then next month or more.<p>It is unrealistic to think that there will be a V bottom like after December 2018. The best the bulls can probably get over the next year is a trading range.<p>For the bears, today is a Low 1 sell signal bar in a strong bear trend. But the trend is climactic and today’s bull body make it a weak sell signal bar. Traders expect a strong short covering rally and then a trading range soon. Consequently, there is likely not much downside risk over the next couple weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is in an expanding triangle. However, the bulls need a strong reversal up to convince traders that the 8 month trading range is intact. Without that, the bears will try to continue the 2 year bear trend down to par (1.00).<p>Friday and Monday formed a micro double bottom in a sell climax. Because they were doji candlesticks, they lack conviction for the bulls. That makes them weak buy signal bars. However, traders expect a short covering rally soon.<p>By today going above yesterday’s high, the EURUSD triggered a weak buy signal. Since the 2 week selloff has been climactic, the 1st reversal up will probably be minor. A minor reversal means that it becomes either a bear flag or a bull leg in what will end up as a trading range. There is only a 30% chance of a major reversal into a bull trend without at least a double bottom.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high. This triggered a minor buy signal on the daily chart. However, the rally only went slightly above yesterday’s high before pulling back. This is a weak bull breakout.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways for 6 hours. Day traders have been scalping for about 20 pips. There is no sign that this is about to end.<p>The bulls would like today to close far above yesterday’s high. But they would be satisfied with it closing just a little above that high.<p>The bears want the day to close on its low. It would then be a stronger Low 1 sell signal bar for tomorrow. Their minimum goal is a close below yesterday’s high. They would like a close below the open so that today would be a more reliable sell signal bar for tomorrow.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-24-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls got a rally for a couple hours. There was then a deep pullback and the day entered a trading range. Since today closed near its high, there is an increased chance of higher prices tomorrow.<p>While the bulls hope that today will be the start of a short covering rally, the day was not particularly strongly bullish. Furthermore, the daily chart is still in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. So far, today is just a 1 day pullback.<p>But if the bulls can get 2 – 3 or more consecutive bull days, especially with big bodies, traders will look for a trading range over then next month or more.<p>It is unrealistic to think that there will be a V bottom like after December 2018. The best the bulls can probably get over the next year is a trading range.<p>For the bears, today is a Low 1 sell signal bar in a strong bear trend. But the trend is climactic and today’s bull body make it a weak sell signal bar. Traders expect a strong short covering rally and then a trading range soon. Consequently, there is likely not much downside risk over the next couple weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But the bulls were unable to maintain control and the day entered a trading range. Because it closed near its high, there is an increased chance of higher prices today.<p>Everyone knows that the selling has been unusually extreme. There has not been a comparable initial selloff since the Great Depression. Consequently, the downside risk from here is probably not great over the next few weeks. Traders are looking for a short covering rally. It might have begun yesterday.<p>If the bulls can start to get bull bars on the daily chart, the bear trend will evolve into a trading range. Since the selloff was so extreme, the bears might not sell aggressively again for more than a month. The trading range could last several months. If yesterday was not the start of the trading range, it will probably begin soon.<p>From a fundamental perspective, the Fed basically said that they will print as much money as need to keep the economy going. Since the selloff has been huge, traders believe that the Fed will prevent much further downside near term.<h3>Trading range likely after strong bear trend</h3><p>Yesterday broke above the tight bear channel and the December 2018 low on the daily chart. Today is the follow-through day. If the bulls get another big bull bar on the daily chart, traders will conclude that the short covering rally is underway.<p>But since the rally will probably be minor, a trading range is likely. When the market is in a trading range, traders regularly get disappointed. Therefore today will probably not be an obviously strong bull trend day.<p>However, the minimum that the bulls want is a close at or above the open. That would increase the chance of higher prices over the next week.<p>The bears know that the daily chart is still in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. They want it to continue indefinitely. They therefore will try to make yesterday’s rally trap hopeful bulls. If today is a bear bar closing near its low, today will be a sell signal bar for a Low 1 bear flag. If tomorrow is then a big bear bar, traders will conclude that the bear trend is still intact.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini rallied overnight and then sold off. However, it has been mostly sideways. Traders want more information.<p>They might be waiting for tomorrow’s Jobless Claims. Everyone knows they will be horribly high. I suspect the issue is more technical. Traders are deciding if the break below the December 2018 low will succeed or fail.<p>With the sell climax being the most extreme since the 1929 Crash, there is probably not much left to the downside over the next few weeks. That increases the chance of higher prices and bull trend days.<p>But since any rally will probably end up as a leg in a 2 – 6 month trading range, traders should expect disappointing follow-through and lots of reversals. That increases the chance of more trading range trading on the 5 minute chart as well. Most days over the past 2 weeks have had at least one reversal. That is likely again today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-25.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If they get a close far above yesterday’s high, traders would expect higher prices.<p>But even if they get their rally, it will more likely be a leg in the 8 month trading range than the start of a bull trend. Strong bear trends typically do not reverse into bull trends without first transitioning into trading ranges. Consequently, if the bulls get a rally for a couple of weeks, most traders would like to see a test back down and then a 2nd reversal up. If they get that, the bulls would have a better chance of creating a bull trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market so far has been sideways and within yesterday’s range. It is an inside day. Traders are in search of more information. If it remains that way, it will be both a buy and sell signal bar on the daily chart for tomorrow.<p>The past 3 days have had bull bodies. That is good for the bulls. But if there is going to be a rally, traders want to see one or more big bull trend days.<p>So far today, day traders have been scalping for 20 pips. The bulls will try to get today to close above the open. Today would then be the 4th consecutive bull day on the daily charts. That represents buying pressure and it increases the chance of the rally beginning soon.<p>Can the past 4 days be a bear flag? Of course, but after an extreme sell climax, it would probably be the Final Bear Flag. Traders expect a bounce soon.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-buy-climax-and-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax and lower high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This week is now an outside up week.<p>However, the late selloff from a lower high major trend reversal erased much of the bullishness. There was a small bull body on the daily chart. That is enough to confirm yesterday’s rally, but is the minimum confirmation possible.<p>Today is a sell signal bar for tomorrow. There is still a Small Pullback Bear Trend. But after 2 closes above the month-long bear channel, there will probably be buyers below today’s low.<p>There are only 4 trading days left to the month. The bulls want March to close back above the 12 year bull trend line.

It was therefore confirmation that Tuesday’s breakout will probably be the start of a strong short covering rally.<p>However, the late selloff was a reminder that the rally will probably only lead to a trading range and not a bull trend. Yesterday is a sell signal bar in the month-long Small Pullback Bear Trend. But, there will probably be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>The late selloff created a tail on the top of yesterday’s candlestick. The doji bar on the daily chart was disappointing for the bulls. Disappointment is a hallmark of a trading range.<p>It is consistent with what I have been saying. A strong short covering rally will only be a leg in a trading range on the daily chart. The top of the current leg up could be above 3,000 over the next 3 weeks. But, the bulls will probably not test the old high for at least a year or two.<h3>Outside up week</h3><p>Yesterday traded above last week’s high after falling below its low on Monday. This week is therefore an outside up week. It increases the chance of higher prices over the next few weeks. This will be especially true if this week closes above last week’s high and on the high of this week.<p>With only a few trading days left in March, the bulls would like the month to close back above the 12 year bull trend line. That is just above 2600 and certainly within reach.<p>Less likely, the bears will succeed in reversing the week back down to below last week’s low. This week would then be outside down. That would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is unchanged in the Globex session. There is still a possible Small Pullback Bear Trend on the daily chart. Consequently, there is an increased chance that today will trigger the sell signal by going below yesterday’s low.<p>However, there have been consecutive closes on the daily chart above the bear trend line. Also, the Emini is at major support and the selloff already exceeded the average bear trend. Traders should expect buyers below yesterday’s low.<p>The odds are that the short covering rally is underway. That increases the chances of bull trend days over the next couple of weeks. Today will probably not be a big bear day.<p>If the short-term trend has in fact turned up, there will be signs of strength. One would be having this week close above last week’s high. Yesterday failed repeatedly to hold above that high. But as long as the Emini does not sell off strongly below yesterday’s low, the bulls will try to have the week close above last week’s high when the week ends tomorrow.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-buy-climax-and-lower-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-26.png\" alt=\"Emini buy climax and lower high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It has reversed up from an expanding triangle bottom this week.<p>While today is the 5th consecutive bull day, the rally will probably not go above the March high without at least one pullback lasting a few days. There is no sign of a top, but the EURUSD is entering a resistance zone. It is now at the 20 day EMA. A 50% retracement is a little higher. The bulls want the bull micro channel continues up to the March 16 sell climax high without a pullback, but that is unlikely.<p>The bears are hoping that the 5 day rally is just a bear flag. They had a very strong reversal down from a very strong rally in March. That typically results in at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>But after 5 days up, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get more than a 2 day pullback. Also, even if they drive the market down to the March low, there is still an 8 month trading range. Trading ranges resist breaking out. It is therefore more likely that a selloff would bounce around the March low. Traders should expect a small trading range for the next few weeks in the bottom half of the 8 month trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied 100 pips overnight. The bars were not big and there was a lot of overlap, but the channel was tight. Day traders have been mostly looking to buy pullbacks. But, with the sharp pullback over the past hour, they will also look to sell rallies for scalps.<p>This selloff is big enough to make a big rally from here unlikely today. The rally has been strong enough to make a bear trend. Today will probably continue sideways to up.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was therefore confirmation that Tuesday’s breakout will probably be the start of a strong short covering rally.<p>However, the late selloff was a reminder that the rally will probably only lead to a trading range and not a bull trend. Yesterday is a sell signal bar in the month-long Small Pullback Bear Trend. But, there will probably be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>The late selloff created a tail on the top of yesterday’s candlestick. The doji bar on the daily chart was disappointing for the bulls. Disappointment is a hallmark of a trading range.<p>It is consistent with what I have been saying. A strong short covering rally will only be a leg in a trading range on the daily chart. The top of the current leg up could be above 3,000 over the next 3 weeks. But, the bulls will probably not test the old high for at least a year or two.<h3>Outside up week</h3><p>Yesterday traded above last week’s high after falling below its low on Monday. This week is therefore an outside up week. It increases the chance of higher prices over the next few weeks. This will be especially true if this week closes above last week’s high and on the high of this week.<p>With only a few trading days left in March, the bulls would like the month to close back above the 12 year bull trend line. That is just above 2600 and certainly within reach.<p>Less likely, the bears will succeed in reversing the week back down to below last week’s low. This week would then be outside down.

It was in a trading range for most of the day, just above last week’s high and a little below the 2600 Big Round Number. It rallied to above 2600 in the final minutes. Both numbers might be magnets today.<p>The next major target is 2715. That is 20% down from the high. If the Emini gets back above it, the Emini will no longer be in a bear market. The bulls should get there and they might do it today.<p>This week is outside up (it traded below and above last week’s range) and today is Friday. The bulls want today to close above last week’s high. This week would then be a stronger buy signal bar for next week on the weekly chart.<h3>Strong rally so now trading range</h3><p>Because the selloff was so extreme, the bear rally could last for months. However, the Emini has probably evolved from a bear trend on the daily chart into a trading range, and not into a bull trend. It will probably be sideways for months. There might be a brief new low. The top of the range will probably be above 3000.<p>Can today be a huge bull or bear trend day? That is always possible, but I think it will be more like yesterday and have a lot of trading range price action. If so, it might get drawn to last week’s high in the final hour and then end the week a little bit above or below it.<h3>Weekly support and resistance can be important at the end of a Friday</h3><p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. This is especially true in the final hour. This week is an outside up candlestick on the weekly chart. If the bulls can get the week to close at least above last week’s high, they will have a better chance of higher prices next week. Consequently, last week’s high and yesterday’s high are both magnets today.<p>Yesterday’s low is also a magnet. On the Globex daily chart, today traded above yesterday’s high. The bears would like today to fall below yesterday’s low. Today would then be an outside down bar at the 20 day EMA. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>However, there is a bullish tendency at the end of the March quarter. The bulls will probably buy today’s pullback before Tuesday’s close when March ends.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 60 points in the Globex session. The bulls hope that the overnight bear channel is simply a bull flag in a 3 day bull trend. It probably is, but the Emini could pull back more before trying again to reach the targets above.<p>It is back in yesterday’s 5 hour trading range. That is an area of agreement. The Emini will probably hold in that area today. If the Emini is within 50 points of last week’s high in the final hour, it will probably get drawn there and close near it.<p>It does not matter if it closes a little above or below. There would still likely be some follow-through buying early next week into the end of the quarter.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-27.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The EURUSD is now in the sell zone, around the EMA and a 50% pullback to the middle of the triangle. Traders expect a brief pullback and then at least one more small leg up to around the March 16 sell climax high.<p>After several big reversals up and down, the market is back to neutral. It is in the middle of its 8 month trading range.<h3>Weekly support and resistance not important today</h3><p>Since today is Friday, there is an increased chance of a big move late in the session. The bulls want the week to close on the high. However, it is near enough so that this week is already a big bull bar on the weekly chart. That reduces the incentive for them to buy aggressively today.<p>For the bears, the weekly chart now has a prominent tail. Having it get a little bigger will not change anything for next week. Therefore, they too have little incentive to do anything to change the appearance of the weekly chart.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to above yesterday’s high, but then reversed down. It is stalling in a resistance zone on the daily chart after a rally from a sell climax. That reduces the chance of a strong bull trend day today.<p>But after a strong rally for several days, this 1st reversal down will probably not get too far. That means the EURUSD will probably not fall much further today.<p>It has traded in a 40 pip range for the past 5 hours. Traders expect that to continue for the remainder of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-late-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini late bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed down to just below last week’s high and the 60 minute EMA at the end of the day.<p>Today was an inside day. It is therefore both a buy signal bar and a sell signal bar for Monday. However, it is a doji bar and therefore it is a weak signal bar. There might be more buyers below and sellers above.<p>The Emini formed an outside up week on the weekly chart. It is therefore a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. But it closed below last week’s high and this week’s candlestick had a prominent tail above. It is therefore a weaker buy signal bar for next week.<p>It is important to note that there is often buying into the end of March. Portfolio managers want to own the best stocks when they report their quarterly holdings. Consequently, there is often window dressing buying at then end of March. This reduces the chance of a big selloff on Monday or Tuesday.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls should get there and they might do it today.<p>This week is outside up (it traded below and above last week’s range) and today is Friday. The bulls want today to close above last week’s high. This week would then be a stronger buy signal bar for next week on the weekly chart.<h3>Strong rally so now trading range</h3><p>Because the selloff was so extreme, the bear rally could last for months. However, the Emini has probably evolved from a bear trend on the daily chart into a trading range, and not into a bull trend. It will probably be sideways for months. There might be a brief new low. The top of the range will probably be above 3000.<p>Can today be a huge bull or bear trend day? That is always possible, but I think it will be more like yesterday and have a lot of trading range price action. If so, it might get drawn to last week’s high in the final hour and then end the week a little bit above or below it.<h3>Weekly support and resistance can be important at the end of a Friday</h3><p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. This is especially true in the final hour. This week is an outside up candlestick on the weekly chart. If the bulls can get the week to close at least above last week’s high, they will have a better chance of higher prices next week. Consequently, last week’s high and yesterday’s high are both magnets today.<p>Yesterday’s low is also a magnet. On the Globex daily chart, today traded above yesterday’s high. The bears would like today to fall below yesterday’s low. Today would then be an outside down bar at the 20 day EMA. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>However, there is a bullish tendency at the end of the March quarter. The bulls will probably buy today’s pullback before Tuesday’s close when March ends.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 60 points in the Globex session. The bulls hope that the overnight bear channel is simply a bull flag in a 3 day bull trend. It probably is, but the Emini could pull back more before trying again to reach the targets above.<p>It is back in yesterday’s 5 hour trading range. That is an area of agreement. The Emini will probably hold in that area today. If the Emini is within 50 points of last week’s high in the final hour, it will probably get drawn there and close near it.<p>It does not matter if it closes a little above or below. There would still likely be some follow-through buying early next week into the end of the quarter.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-bull-trend-resumption-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-27.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The EURUSD is now in the sell zone, around the EMA and a 50% pullback to the middle of the triangle. Traders expect a brief pullback and then at least one more small leg up to around the March 16 sell climax high.<p>After several big reversals up and down, the market is back to neutral. It is in the middle of its 8 month trading range.<h3>Weekly support and resistance not important today</h3><p>Since today is Friday, there is an increased chance of a big move late in the session. The bulls want the week to close on the high. However, it is near enough so that this week is already a big bull bar on the weekly chart. That reduces the incentive for them to buy aggressively today.<p>For the bears, the weekly chart now has a prominent tail. Having it get a little bigger will not change anything for next week. Therefore, they too have little incentive to do anything to change the appearance of the weekly chart.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied to above yesterday’s high, but then reversed down. It is stalling in a resistance zone on the daily chart after a rally from a sell climax. That reduces the chance of a strong bull trend day today.<p>But after a strong rally for several days, this 1st reversal down will probably not get too far. That means the EURUSD will probably not fall much further today.<p>It has traded in a 40 pip range for the past 5 hours. Traders expect that to continue for the remainder of the day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-late-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini late bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed down to just below last week’s high and the 60 minute EMA at the end of the day.<p>Today was an inside day. It is therefore both a buy signal bar and a sell signal bar for Monday. However, it is a doji bar and therefore it is a weak signal bar. There might be more buyers below and sellers above.<p>The Emini formed an outside up week on the weekly chart. It is therefore a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. But it closed below last week’s high and this week’s candlestick had a prominent tail above. It is therefore a weaker buy signal bar for next week.<p>It is important to note that there is often buying into the end of March. Portfolio managers want to own the best stocks when they report their quarterly holdings. Consequently, there is often window dressing buying at then end of March. This reduces the chance of a big selloff on Monday or Tuesday.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The 1st leg up of the short covering rally could last several weeks. In a few months, it might reach 2,800 – 3,000. Traders should expect a trading range for a couple months and probably all year.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market has begun a trading range after a strong reversal down from an extreme buy climax.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has a weak expanding triangle bottom. It will probably work a little higher, but then settle into a trading range.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Trading range after extreme buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-sideways-after-extreme-buy-climax-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-28.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart sideways after extreme buy climax reversal\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures this week traded within last week’s range. It was an inside bar. In a bull trend, that is both a buy and sell signal bar. It followed a huge reversal down from the most extreme buy climax in history.<p>A big move up followed by a big move down creates big confusion. A trader who is confused is confident about only one thing. That is that the market is not clearly trending up or down.<p>Consequently, the trader is unwilling to hold onto a long when the market is near recent highs. He is also unwilling to hold onto a short position when the market is near recent lows.<p>He is looking to take quick profits. That means he only wants to buy low and sell high. This creates a trading range. The weekly chart has been sideways for 4 weeks.<h3>Expect at least a couple legs sideways to down after a buy climax</h3><p>After a routine buy climax, traders expect a couple legs sideways to down for about 10 bars. On the weekly chart, that means 2 – 3 months.<p>When the buy climax is the most extreme in history, the trading range will probably last longer and be taller. The bottom of the range will probably be around 155 – 160. That was the bottom of a 4 month trading range last year. Traders will assume that buyers will buy again at that level.<p>The reversal down from the March high was extremely fast and far. Traders will expect sellers around that level again. Consequently, the trading range will probably be from around 160 to 190.<h3>Is a trend likely soon?</h3><p>Can the 3 week pullback just be another bull flag? Unlikely. When a reversal down is as strong as this one has been, there is a 70% chance of at least a small 2nd leg down.<p>Can the pullback continue down and grow into a bear trend? That is also unlikely. The bull channel up from the December low was very tight. When a bull trend is that strong, the 1st reversal down is typically minor. A minor reversal means that it is either a bull flag or a bear leg in what will become a trading range.<p>Since there will probably be at least one more leg down, these 3 weeks have formed a weak bull flag. There will probably be more sellers than buyers above because traders expect at least as small 2nd leg sideways to down.<h3>The midpoint of March’s range is a magnet on the monthly</h3><p>There are 2 trading days left in March. The bond futures contract is in the middle of March’s very big range.<p>March will probably not close near its high or low. That makes the 179 14/32 midpoint important. It is more symbolic. The bulls want the month to close above the midpoint. They can then claim that they won the month. The bears want the month to close below the midpoint.<p>However, a close a little above or below the midpoint is much less important than the climactic reversal down from an extreme buy climax. Traders should expect the bond futures to be sideways for at least a couple months. They will look for reversals up and down every week or two.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Expanding triangle bottom but minor reversal up</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-middle-of-8-month-expanding-triangle-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-28-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart in middle of 8 month expanding triangle\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart rallied strongly this week. It formed a big bull reversal candlestick this week. It is a buy signal bar for next week. Traders see the past 8 month trading range as an expanding triangle. That is a type of major trend reversal.<p>A good looking major trend reversal has a 40% chance of leading to an actual reversal up into a bull trend. After an extremely strong selloff like this one, until there is also a double bottom, there is only a 30% chance of this growing into a bull trend.<p>Prior to this week, there was a 2 week collapse after a strong rally to above the 18 month bear trend line. That trend line is the top of the bear channel in the 2 year bear trend. This week reversed up after breaking below the bottom of the bear channel.<h3>Minor reversal up for a couple weeks</h3><p>While the bulls want as strong a reversal up as the reversal down was, that is unlikely. When there is a reversal up after a reversal down, it typically is minor. Traders usually want to see at least a small double bottom before they believe that a bull trend might be starting.<p>Therefore, as bullish as this week was, the context is not great. Context means the bars to the left. The bulls might be able to continue the reversal up for another couple weeks. However, it is unlikely to reach the March high without first testing the March low.<p>How high up can it go? A common target for a minor reversal up is the 50% retracement. This rally is already above that resistance. Less likely, the rally will reach the March high before testing the March low.<h3>Can the bear trend fall down to par (1.00)?</h3><p>No matter how strong any rally has been for 2 years, it was always followed by a new low. This is a bear channel. Even though the early March rally was by far the strongest in the 2 year bear trend, the bears still turned the EURUSD down to a new low.<p>Traders are therefore looking at the next lower support levels. The first is the January 2017 low at the bottom of the strong 2017 rally. As long as the current 2 year bear trend holds above that low, traders will wonder if the 2 year selloff is just a protracted pullback from that bull trend. That means it is still a possible bull flag.<p>But if the EURUSD falls below that low, it will no longer be a possible bottom of the bear trend that began in 2008. They will then look at the next lower support. That is 1.00 (par).<h3>Isn’t the U.S. creating inflation by printing dollars?</h3><p>It is easy to argue that the EURUSD collapsed in March due to a flight to safety in U.S. markets. That means dollars. And then the EURUSD reversed up sharply this week when the Fed basically said that the U.S. would print “infinite dollars” to protect the economy.<p>I never pay attention to that because it is impossible to know why the institutions are buying or selling. All I know is that there was a strong break below an 8 month range and a strong reversal up. I also know that the 1st reversal up from a collapse usually will be followed by a test down. That is all that matters.<p>I want to go back to discredit the teleological arguments. Think about it. If the U.S. begins to print infinite dollars and it rescues the economy, what will the EU do? It will print infinite Euros. China and Japan will also print infinite money.<p>All of this cancels out. I don’t want to try to figure out who is doing more because it will not make me richer. The charts say this bounce has a little more to go and then there will be a test down.<h3>Buyers below the 2017 low on the monthly chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-doji-in-5-year-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-28-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has doji in 5 year trading range\"></a></figure><p>There are 2 trading days left in March. March reversed down from above the February high and up from below the February low. It is therefore on outside down bar.<p>However, it is now in the middle of the March candlestick. It is a huge doji candlestick. That means it is neutral. Traders therefore do not expect a big move up or down in April.<p>Whenever a market falls below major support like the 2017 low, the breakout has a 50% chance of succeeding. Success means having at least a couple legs down, often to a measured move.<p>The 2 year trading range is more than 2,000 pips tall. Given how the 12 year selloff can still be a bull flag on the monthly chart, there is only be a 40% chance of a measured move down. There is a 60% chance that a break below the 2017 low will reverse up within a few month.<p>If it did, there would be an expanding triangle bottom, beginning with the March 2015 low. Furthermore, there would be a wedge bull flag where the 1st 2 lows are November 2005 low and the January 2017 low.<p>Each bar on the monthly chart is one month. It could take more than a year for the EURUSD to fall below the 2017 low and then clearly reverse up.<h2>Coronavirus is still unstoppable</h2><p>Traders accept that the coronavirus will be with us for about a year. The stock market crash was a rapid repricing of assets due to the damage being caused by the coronavirus pandemic.<p>Traders are wondering if the Emini is now fairly priced in light of the great reduction in corporate earnings over until there is a vaccine. It still might be overbought, given the change in fundamentals. No one knows.<p>However, the Emini has already sold off more than in most bear markets. That is reason enough for traders to suspect that it has fallen enough, at least for a few months.<p>What happens if the worst case scenario unfolds and half of the country gets infected? Traders are certainly aware of that possibility, and it might already be fully priced in. It is too early to tell. We need more information. It will probably take a few months for traders to decide if the current low is low enough.<p>It probably is not since the final low once a bear market begins typically comes a year after the start of the bear market. That means there are usually one or more strong rallies before the final leg down.<p>Also, this trading range will probably last for a decade and make at least a couple new lows after the media declares that the low is in.<h3>Some medical news about the coronavirus</h3><p>As you know, I am an MD. I also have some subspecialty experience in eye viral infections. I therefore have a special interest in this pandemic.<p>When a drug company creates a vaccine or any drug, it has to pass 3 phases of testing before the FDA will give its approval. Dr. Fauci this week said that the government might be willing to provide financial guarantees to get a drug released sooner.<p>He said that the U.S. government might pay for a company, if it has a vaccine that passes phase II, to produce huge quantities of the vaccine at the end of phase II, in case phase III is successful. Then, the public could get vaccinated immediately after phase III, assuming the drug gets approved. That would save several months and thousands of lives.<h3>It’s all about the ventilators</h3><p>We are entering into a frightening phase in the pandemic. Many hospitals and states will probably run out of ventilators over the next month. The sudden surge in deaths will probably be shocking enough to further depress the economy.<p>However, the rate of increase in new infections will probably begin to turn down in May. That should improve consumer confidence until a 2nd wave starts in the fall.<p>Doctors have been warning about the shortage of ventilators. The U.S. has 60,00 of them, plus 100,000 older ones in storage. Currently, 5 – 15% of patients need them. Therefore, if the number of infections gets above 1 – 2 million, there will not be enough ventilators. At the current doubling rate, that could happen by the end of April. I am still hoping that the rate of new infections will slow down soon, but there is no evidence of a slowdown yet.<p>Italy had a terrible ventilator shortage this month and the death rate went from 2% to 9%. If millions of Americans get sick, most who need ventilators will not get them and the number of deaths will be frightening.<p>A ventilator pumps air into a person’s lungs. There is talk about having a splitter in the line and connecting 2 patients to one ventilator. In normal times, that would be unthinkable. But if a patient needs one and has a 50% chance of death without it, most family members would eagerly consent to having him share it with another patient. It is not as if he is going to contract a coronavirus infection from the other person.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Bulls trying to hold above monthly bull trend line</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-broke-below-bull-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-28-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart broke below bull trend line\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;in March formed the biggest bar in the history of the stock market. It broke below the December 2018 low, which was the bottom of the 2 year trading range.<p>However, it bounced strongly this past week. The bulls are trying to minimize the damage when the month ends on Tuesday. Their their first goal is to have March close above that December 2018 low. The Emini therefore would still be in its 2 year trading range.<p>A more important goal is to have the Emini close back above the bottom of the 11 year bull trend line. That line is around 2610.<p>There is a small chance that the March might even close above 2706. That is 20% down from the February 19 all-time high. If the bulls can get the Emini back above that line, it would no longer be in a bear trend.<h3>Has the bear trend ended?</h3><p>No. The past 2 months were surprisingly big bear bars. When there is a bear surprise, there typically will be at least a small 2nd leg down. A surprise means that traders were not expecting it. That means there are many bulls who failed to exit. They are hoping for a rally that will allow them to sell with a smaller loss. That means there is supply above.<p>Also, there are bears unwilling to sell too low, but eager to sell a bounce. They, too, want a rally to sell.<p>With both bulls and bears hoping to sell a rally, there should be at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. However, the sell climax was extreme. Therefore, the rally could be surprisingly big as well.<p>For example it might even reach the March 3 high on the daily chart. That was the 1st pullback after the initial collapse. It was therefore the start of the parabolic wedge bear channel. That is always a magnet for a rally in a bear trend.<p>More likely, the rally will stall around the 3,000 Big Round Number, which is around several highs in 2018 and 2019.<h3>Can April continue to crash down?</h3><p>After 2 big bear bars, there is an increased chance of a 3rd bear bar, but there are several factors that reduce the chance of a 3rd huge bear bar. The obvious one is that the Emini is at the bottom of its 2 year trading range. Trading ranges resist breaking out.<p>Also, the average bear market falls about 30%. The selloff in the Emini was almost 35%. It is already more than average. In most bear markets, it takes about a year to get there. Since the Emini got there so quickly, traders think that it is overdone near-term.<p>President Trump took office on January 20, 2017. The Emini tested below the open of that day several times this week. The selloff therefore briefly erased all of the gains of his presidency. However, it reversed up violently. Traders now see that price as strong support.<h3>The Fed will protect the economy</h3><p>The most important reason why April will probably not crash is that the Fed is determined to prevent more damage to the economy. Neel Kaskari is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and he was on 60 Minutes last week. He made it clear that the Fed would print “infinite” dollars to save the economy.<p>That is giving institutions the confidence that they need to buy again. In addition, Congress’s rescue plan is important. The government’s actions should be enough to prevent much lower prices in April. Since the Emini is holding important support, it will probably be sideways to up for at least a month.<p>But, this damage is ongoing and will take a long time to heal. Furthermore, there are underlying problems with the economy. How do I know? The huge buy climax in 2017 was the most extreme in history. The bulls will need years to recover. This will probably result in a trading range for a decade. Any rally will probably only be a bull leg in that 10 year trading range.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Expanding triangle bottom and short covering rally in April</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-expanding-triangle-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-28-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart expanding triangle bottom\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart traded below last week’s low and then above its high. This week is therefore an outside up candlestick. The bulls see it as a failed breakout below the December 2018 bottom of the 2 year trading range.<h3>Expanding triangle bottom</h3><p>This week is now a buy signal bar for an expanding triangle bottom. The 1st 2 lows are the February and December 2018 lows. An expanding triangle bottom often leads to a bull trend and a break above the top of the triangle. That is the February all-time high.<p>However, this reversal up is coming after an exceptionally strong selloff. It is more likely that the 1st rally will have a hard time getting much above the middle of the triangle. That is around 2800 – 3000. Many bulls who bought this week will take profits there. The bulls who bought higher will sell since they recovered half of their losses. The bears will begin to look to sell there, expecting a test of the March low. Therefore, the reversal will probably be minor. Traders should understand that it is more likely to lead to a trading range or a bear flag than to a bull trend.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Reversing up from a parabolic wedge sell climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-has-strong-1st-leg-up-from-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-28-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart has strong 1st leg up from sell climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart reversed up strongly this week. It broke above the month-long bear trend line. The Emini is no longer in a Small Pullback Bear Trend. However, it is still in a bear trend… and it is now additionally in a bull trend! And that means it is also in a trading range!!<p>How can that be? If this rally turns down and there is a new low, traders will say that the rally was just a pullback in the bear trend. If the Emini continues up to a new high, they will say that the bull trend began this week.<p>Since both are reasonable possibilities, the Emini is currently both in a bear trend and in a bull trend. That is confusing, and it also means that it is in a trading range.<h3>Confusion means traders want more information</h3><p>When there is a trading range, traders want more information before deciding on the direction over the next few months. They usually need a lot of bars before they will have a strong opinion.<p>A lot of bars could mean several months. If that is true, there will be legs up and down. Furthermore, there will be both buy and sell setups in the range. For example, most trading ranges have both a double top and a double bottom.<p>For traders starting out, this is an annoying concept. How can the market be in both a bull and a bear trend at the same time? However, experienced traders know that this is common after a big move. Sometimes, the direction is simply not clear. This is one of those times.<h3>Bear markets usually last about a year</h3><p>Traders are wondering if this reversal up will be like the January 2019 V bottom. Bear trends end with V bottoms only about 20% of the time. Therefore, even if there is a strong rally for a few months, it will probably not continue up to the old high.<p>If the rally is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend in April and May, more and more people will claim that it is a repeat of the January 2019 bottom. But there is an 80% chance that they will be wrong.<p>When a selloff is as strong as this one has been, the first reversal up is typically minor. This is true even if it goes straight up for a couple months.<p>A minor rally means that traders should expect the rally to reverse down and test the bear low. At the moment, that is the March low. If there is a 2nd reversal up from around that low, the probability of a reversal up into a bull trend would be greater. Traders would look at that buy signal as a major trend reversal.<p>The end of a bear market does not mean the start of a bull market. The Emini will probably be sideways for a decade. That means no bull or bear market. But there will be trends up and down within that range, and some will last 1 – 3 years<h3>How high will the Emini go?</h3><p>It is important to remember that a good major trend reversal setup has only a 40% chance of actually leading to a new trend. Therefore, a trading range is likely for the next several months. It could last all year. The Emini will probably not get back to the old high for at least a year or two. Even if it does, it will probably just be testing the top of what will be a 10 year trading range.<p>Legs in trading ranges often go well past the midpoint. At a minimum, this rally will probably get above 2615.40. That is a 20% rally from the low. The bulls could argue that the Emini is back to being in a bull trend.<p>A similar target is 2715.00. That is the 20% correction level. If the Emini gets above it, its bear market will have ended, at least temporarily.<p>Another important target is the top of the 2 year trading range, which is just above 3000.<p>Next, the rally after a sell climax frequently retraces up to the top of the most recent leg down. That is the March 3 high of 3125.75. That is so far above that the Emini can probably not get there without a test of the March low first.<p>Most likely, the Emini will have a difficult time getting above 2800 – 3000 for the rest of the year.<h3>Can the bear trend continue down to 50% or more?</h3><p>It is too early to tell. As I said, the final low in a bear market comes on average about a year after the bear trend begins. Traders therefore will wonder if every rally will fail in 2020.<p>The bears hope that the 2 month selloff is a spike in a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. They would like at least 2 more legs down. If they get that, the final low will be 50 – 60% below the February high.<p>The 1929 Crash was a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. There were many legs down and the market lost almost 90%. That will not happen this time. The best the bears will probably get is a 40 – 50% correction. That will only happen if the worst case scenario happens with the coronavirus.<p>The main reason for the 89% loss in 1929 is that the government did not know what it was doing. Today’s government&nbsp;does. However, our government can only minimize the damage. It can not fix the economy. The damage is ongoing and it will take years to repair.&nbsp;<h3>Again, the economic problem was there before the pandemic</h3><p>Since a horribly managed economy&nbsp;in 1929 led to about a 90% loss, and well managed economies over the past 20 years have contained losses to about 60%, I think the worst case today will be about 60%. However, I think it will be much worse and last much longer (a decade) than what I am hearing from any “expert.”<p>I want to be clear. The Titanic hit the iceberg in late 2017. The chart over the next 2 years told us that the economy had very serious problems. If I am right and the economy is stagnant for a decade, it will be due to problems that predated the pandemic. The pandemic pushed the button of a bomb that was there for several years before. If it was not the pandemic, then something else would have been the trigger within the next couple years.<h3>If the bottom is near, is the bull trend resuming?</h3><p>It is a common mistake to assume that the end of a bear trend means the start of a bull trend. Much more often, the bear trend evolves into a trading range.<p>Once the market is clearly in a trading range, there is then a 50% chance of a resumption of the bear trend and a 50% chance of a reversal into a bull trend. This transition will take many months. Consequently, traders should assume that the 2 year trading range will continue into the summer. There might be one more brief new low, but a big new low is unlikely near-term.<p>Furthermore, the 2 year range will likely evolve into a taller range over the next decade. The range will probably be between around 1800 and 3600.<h3>Too many bulls</h3><p>There is too much bullishness out there. Everyone is talking about the bottom being in and how this is such a great buying opportunity. They keep comparing it to the December 2018 selloff and all of the other selloffs over the past decade.<p>The difference is that all of those were in a 12 year bull trend. This selloff is the start of a bear trend. This bear trend will be the 1st bear leg in a decade long trading range. That range will have at least a couple 1 – 3 year bull and bear trends.<p>It is important to not forget that the Emini fell 34% in 5 weeks. Please understand that this represents tremendous damage. It does not get fixed with even massive government action.<p>While the bulls might be able to halt the bears for a while, the bears are still in control. I doubt that this is a bull market. As I have been saying, the market will have a difficult time getting much above the February high for the next decade. Also, the bear market low will probably be between 1800 and 2000.<p>No one knows if that low will come soon or more than a year from now, but it is difficult for me to believe that the Fed and Congress have fixed the economy this quickly.<h3>20% down and now 20% up</h3><p>When the Emini fell to 2706, it was 20% down from the high. That meant it was in a bear market.<p>On Thursday, it rallied above 2614. That is 20% above the bear trend low. The bulls therefore believe that the Emini is now in a bull market. They would like it to totally erase any claims by the bears and therefore want it to get back above 2706.<p>Call it what you want. To me, this is a strong rally after an extremely strong sell climax. There is only a 30% chance that it will continue up to the February high without a test of the March low.<p>Furthermore, there is currently a 60% chance that the March low will not be the final low. Also, there is a 50% chance that the final low will be at least 40% down from the high.<p>The final low typically comes about a year after the bear market begins. However, those odds will get smaller if this rally goes much further up.<h3>What to expect next week</h3><p>The end of the quarter it usually bullish. This is especially true after the most dramatic sell climax in history. The rally is strong enough so that it will probably have at least a small 2nd leg up. But it is still a bear rally and the odds favor at least a test of the March low. Most likely, the final low will be at least 40% down.<p>When will the bears get their test down? No rush. Big Down, Big Up creates Big confusion, and confusion creates trading ranges. Traders are not sure of the direction and are therefore quick to take profits. They bet on reversals instead of successful breakouts.<p>Another hallmark of a trading range is disappointment. Most strong moves up and down will have bad follow-through because traders are unwilling to hold onto positions. They expect reversals.<p>The Emini will probably be in a trading range for several months and possibly all year. That means that it will rally for a week or two and sell off for a week or two. This will probably happen at least a few times.<p>There is probably at least another day or two left to this initial rally. Traders will probably buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback. But then many bulls will take profits on the next brief rally and the bears will begin to sell again. This year will be great for traders and terrible for investors.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for today. Since it was a doji bar, it will probably not lead to a big more up or down.<p>With the 3 day rally as strong as it has been, today might start a 1 – 3 day pullback. The bears hope that the bear trend will resume today. It is more likely that there will probably be more buyers than sellers not far below Friday’s low. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can resume the bear trend.<p>The bulls want a V bottom and a rally up to a new high. After the March coronavirus crash, a trading range is more likely.<p>Last week reversed up strongly from the bottom of a 2 year trading range. It formed an outside up bar on the weekly chart. Last week is therefore a buy signal bar for this week on the weekly chart. However, the prominent tail on top of last week’s candlestick make is a less reliable buy signal bar.<p>Traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to down at some point. However, because the sell climax and the reversal up were extreme, traders are exhausted and confused. That typically results in a trading range. It could last all year.<h3>End of quarter window dressing</h3><p>There is often buying into the end of the 1st quarter. This is especially true after such a dramatic bottom. Consequently, there is buying pressure into tomorrow’s close, which is the final trading day of the month. That reduces the chance of a strong bear day today.<p>With Thursday and Friday being mostly sideways, today might be sideways as well. If so, that would leave tomorrow as the final day for the end of the quarter window dressing (buying).<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini sold overnight to below Friday’s low, triggering a sell signal on the Globex daily chart. However, it then reversed up and it is near the high of the session.<p>The bears want today to trade below Friday’s low on the day session’s daily chart as well. That would trigger the sell signal on that chart and give them another chance of resuming the 2 month bear trend.<p>As I wrote above, last week’s reversal up was strong enough to make traders eager to buy the 1st brief selloff on the daily chart. Furthermore, there is typically buying pressure into the end of the quarter. Consequently, today will probably not be a big bear day, even if it triggers the sell signal on the daily chart. More likely, it will be either a bull trend day or another trading range day.<p>There have been many surprisingly big days up and down for 2 months. That increases the chance of a surprise today. Traders will therefore be ready for anything.<p>With Friday being a trading range day and today opening around Friday’s close, there is an increased chance of a trading range open. If so, day traders will take quick profits until there is either a strong breakout up or down, a double bottom, a double top, a wedge bottom, or a wedge top.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-late-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-30.png\" alt=\"Emini late bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It is now back in the middle of the triangle.<p>After 4 big bull days, the stop for the bulls is far below. Many traders will reduce risk by taking profits (long liquidation or long covering). This will probably result in several days of sideways to down trading. The overnight selloff is a sign that this has begun.<p>The bears want today’s reversal to form a double top bear flag with the March 16 high. They are hoping that the 5 day rally is just a unusually big pullback from a breakout to a new low in the 2 year bear trend. But they know that they will probably need at least a micro double top before they can get a new low. Consequently, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 5 day pullback.<p>Over the past 2 months, there have been 2 big moves down and 2 big moves up. The EURUSD is now in the middle of all of those moves. What is more likely, the start of a strong breakout of the 5 month range or a continuation of the range?<p>Big reversals create big confusion. Confusion means there is no consensus about the direction. Traders expect at least a few more weeks of sideways trading before there might be evidence that a trend will begin.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market tested Friday’s high overnight and then sold off in a weak bear channel. While much of the time was sideways, there was as series of lower lows and highs. It has been easier to make money shorting. There is no sign of a bottom.<p>However, the body of today’s candlestick on the daily chart is about as big as Friday’s bull body. There is now symmetry, and markets often make symmetrical moves.<p>Also, Friday was a huge bull day in a strong rally. It is unlikely that today’s range will be much bigger than Friday’s.<p>Consequently, the selloff will probably convert into a trading range soon. But as long as it is in a tight bear channel, it will continue to be easier to make money by selling rallies than by buying reversals up.<p>Once there is a 30 – 40 pip rally, traders will conclude that the bear trend is evolving into a trading range. They then will be more willing to buy reversals up for 20 pip scalps. However, they will continue to sell rallies unless today reverses up strongly into a bull trend.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-opening-reversal-and-late-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini opening reversal and late bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It then went sideways for several hours. There was late trend resumption up, and the Emini broke above yesterday’s high late in the day. That triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. Since the buy signal bar had a bear body, there might be sellers not far above.<p>Because last week is a buy signal bar on the weekly chart, the bulls would like this week to close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week. So far, this week is an inside bar on the weekly chart. The market might wait for Friday’s unemployment report before making a big move up or down from here.<p>Today is the final day of the month and of the quarter. No one knows whether or not the institutions completed their end of the quarter window dressing yesterday. They probably did not. That increases the chance of a bull day today. The bulls would like the month to close above the month’s midpoint of 2653. The bears want March to close below the 12 year bull trend line, which is around 2600.<p>It is important to note that whenever something is obvious, it might already be priced in. That increases the chance of the opposite. If today starts to sell off strongly, day traders should short, despite the idea that there should be window dressing buying through today’s close.<h3>Resistance is a magnet</h3><p>The next important target is the March 13 close of 2697.25. That day was a huge bull trend day, but the next day gapped far below that close and the Emini collapsed over the next week.<p>Last week’s rally was strong enough for traders to expect tests significant resistance, and that close is significant enough. Bulls who bought it believed that the selloff was extreme. They bought more at last week’s low.<p>Many were disappointed by that final selloff. They will then look to sell part or all of their position on a rally to around that close. The bears know that as well and many will also sell there. If enough traders sell around the same price, the Emini could pull back for several days.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 28 points in the Globex session. So far, there have been more sellers than buyer’s above Friday’s high. While it was a buy signal bar, it was a doji bar just below the resistance of the 20 day EMA and at the magnet of the 2600 Big Round Number.<p>Can the overnight bear trend continue all day? It is more likely that the Emini will continue sideways more into Friday’s unemployment report. It has been sideways now for 3 days.<p>Also, yesterday was a bull channel. There is 75% chance of a break below the bull channel and then an evolution into a trading range.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-opening-reversal-and-late-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-31.png\" alt=\"Emini opening reversal and late bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EURUSD-Forex-pullback-from-double-top-in-expanding-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-31-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex pullback from double top in expanding triangle\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market continued yesterday’s selloff overnight. There is a lower high double top bear flag with the March 16 high.<p>Traders know that most reversals over the past 2 years have had at least a small double top or double bottom. However, they also can see that the last couple reversals were abrupt. The bears are selling, hoping that this one will be abrupt as well.<p>It is more likely that it will be like 90% of past reversals. That means traders will probably buy a 2 – 3 day pullback and look for a test of Friday’s high. They would like to test up to the March 16 high.<p>An expanding triangle is a type of triangle. All triangles are trading ranges. Markets in trading ranges spend most of their time in the middle third. This further increases the chance that the 2 day selloff will not grow into a bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off from yesterday’s close overnight. It fell below Friday’s low and bounced sharply 50 pips over the past 2 hours. That is enough of a bounce to make bulls willing to buy pullbacks. They will bet that the 2 day selloff is evolving into a trading range. They hope that today becomes a reversal day and closes around the open.<p>However, the overnight bear trend was in a tight bear channel. The 2 hour rally is the 1st reversal up. Traders expect it to be minor. They know that a strong bear trend does not typically reverse into a bull trend without some kind of a trading range and double bottom 1st.<p>They also know that the 1st pullback from the strong 4 day rally will likely last only 2 – 5 days. That increases the chance of a major trend reversal up today and a rally back to around the open. They therefore will be willing to swing trade part of a long position if there is a good looking test of the overnight low. That would be a credible major trend reversal.<p>Traders should expect the strong rally to stall within the next hour and for the 5 minute chart to enter a trading range for an hour or two. The bulls will look to buy a reversal up from the bottom of that range for a possible higher low major trend reversal up.<p>However, the bears will look to sell a double top or wedge rally in the developing trading range. They want a 2nd consecutive day closing near its low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Emini-expanding-triangle-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-3-31-2.png\" alt=\"Emini expanding triangle top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bear trend on the weekly chart has been strong and last week’s candlestick had a big tail on top. This is therefore a weak buy setup. There were more sellers than buyers above last week’s high.<p>The Emini has not had a pullback in 6 days. It is now at the resistance of the 20 day EMA. Also, today had a bear body. These factors make it likely that the Emini will pull back tomorrow to below today’s low. Since the Emini has been sideways for 4 days, it might continue mostly sideways into Friday’s April unemployment report.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
