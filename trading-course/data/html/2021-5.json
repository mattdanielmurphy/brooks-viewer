The recent streak of 13 consecutive bull bars increases the chance of at least a 10% pullback lasting a couple months coming this summer. This week is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart (5 bears bars on daily chart). If next week sells off, then traders will begin to think that a 10% correction is underway.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex chart formed a big bull bar in April, but it is near the top of a 7-year trading range. While the market might rally more in May, it will probably stay within the range for at least a couple more months.<h2 id=\"1-eurusd-forex-market-\">EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3 id=\"2-the-eurusd-monthly-chart\">The EURUSD<em>monthly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EURUSD-Forex-double-bottom-bull-flag-after-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double bottom bull flag after wedge top\"></a></figure><ul><li>March was a big bear bar on the monthly chart.<li>I will show the weekly chart next week, and I show the daily chart in my daily blogs. Today was a big Bear Surprise Bar on the daily chart, which increases the chance of lower prices next week.<li>On the monthly chart, April was a big bull bar that totally reversed March.<li>April broke above the March high, but closed just below the March high.<li>The bulls see April as a reversal up from a double bottom bull flag with the November low.<li>They want the 3-month selloff to be just a pullback, from the 2020 rally up from the March 2020 higher low major trend reversal.<li>The bears want a lower high and a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down from last year’s wedge rally. That is still more likely than a bull trend.</ul><h4 id=\"3-trading-range-for-7-years\">Trading range for 7 years</h4><ul><li>The monthly chart has been in a trading range for 7 years (since February 2015, but the chart above only shows 4 years).<li>Trading ranges regularly disappoint bulls and bears. The close below the March high is disappointing to the bulls, which is a reminder that the yearlong rally has not yet broken out of the 7-year trading range.<li>Every trading range always has both a reasonable buy, and a reasonable sell setup. The bulls have a double bottom bull flag with the November low. The bears have last year’s wedge top and they want a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down.<li>The probability of the direction of the breakout never gets much above 50%. When there is a big bear bar or two, the odds go up slightly for the bears. When there is a strong bull bar, like in April, the odds go up slightly for the bulls.<li>Trading ranges resist change. Until there is a breakout there is no breakout.<li>Until there is a breakout up or down, a strong leg up or down is more likely to reverse, than grow into a trend.<li>While April is bullish, as was last year, the bulls need a couple closes above the February 2018 high before traders will look at this rally on the monthly chart as a bull trend.<li>The bears see the January high as forming a double top with the 2018 high. They hope April is just another test of the top of the 7-year trading range.<li>The bears need a strong sell signal bar this summer before traders will look for a swing down.</ul><h4 id=\"4-what-to-expect-in-may\">What to expect in May</h4><ul><li>I said that the monthly chart is near the top of its 7-year trading range. It has also been in a small trading range for 9 months.<li>With April being a big bull bar, traders might expect May to trade at least a little higher. But, it probably will not break out of the 7-year range. In fact, the odds are against it closing above the January high.<li>There will probably be a month or two down, starting within the next couple months.<li>Traders should expect the 9-month range to continue for at least a couple more months.<li>There is only a 30% chance that May will be a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive big bull bar closing near its high.<li>When a chart is not clearly bullish or bearish, it is in a trading range. Traders know that a reversal every few months is more likely than a move growing into a trend.</ul><h2 id=\"5-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"6-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-SP-500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-extreme-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-1-1.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P 500 futures monthly candlestick chart in extreme buy climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>Consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs.<li>Normally, next month should trade at least a little higher. But because of weekly and daily charts (see below), May might not continue up.<li>Every low for 7 bars (months) has been above the low of the prior month.<li>This is an 8-bar bull micro channel and it is a sign of aggressive buying. Traders will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>1- to 2-month pullback.<li>It is also unsustainable. That means it is a buy climax. A buy climax typically attracts profit takers.<li>There are 3 legs up since the September low. That is a parabolic wedge buy climax, and it often attracts profit takers.<li>Buy climax can continue far longer than what might seem reasonable. However, the acceleration up over the past two months increases the chance of some profit taking soon.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-SP-500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-bear-reversal-sell-signal-bar-in-extreme-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P 500 futures weekly candlestick chart has bear reversal sell signal bar in extreme buy climax.\"></a></figure><ul><li>Bear reversal bar after 5 consecutive bull bars. This week is a sell signal bar for next week.<li>There have not been more than 5 consecutive bull bars in the yearlong bull trend, so this is an extreme buy climax. This increases the chance of profit taking soon.<li>Stop for many bulls is below the March 4 low, which is far below.<li>Easiest way to reduce risk is to reduce position size by taking some profits.<li>Once enough bulls start to take profits, there will be a 2- to 3-week selloff.<li>Yearlong rally has been a Small Pullback Bull Trend, which usually does not last much longer than 50 to 60 bars.<li>Current rally has lasted more than 50 bars, so increased chance of it transitioning into a trading range for a couple months.<li>Small Pullback Bull Trend is a very strong bull trend. Traders want to buy the 1<sup>st</sup>10% pullback.<li>It usually does not reverse into a bear trend. It typically evolves into a trading range. Once there is a trading range, the bears would then have a 40% chance of a trend reversal down.<li>Because the buy climax is extreme, many bulls will not look to buy again until after a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down, like September and October last year.<li>Therefore, while the initial selloff might only be 3 weeks, the Emini might go sideways for a couple months.<li>Since bull trend has been accelerating up for 2 months, increased chance that this is a blow-off top.<li>That typically leads to a deeper and longer pullback. Therefore, once there is a pullback, it could be more significant than in September and October 2020. There is a 30% chance it could be 20% and last several months.</ul><h3 id=\"8-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-SP-500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-5-consecutive-bear-doji-bars-in-extreme-buy-climax-at-measured-move-target-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-1-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P 500 futures daily candlestick chart has 5 bear bars (consecutive doji bars) in extreme buy climax at measured move target.png\"></a></figure><ul><li>Strong Small Pullback Bull Trend since March 25.<li>Markets resist chance. While there is an extreme buy climax, the odds always favor higher prices until there is a strong reversal down. By the time traders conclude that a correction is underway, it is usually already about half over.<li>This week had 5 bear bars (consecutive doji bars). This is very unusual and it increases the chance of a reversal down next week.<li>9 of the last 11 bars had small bodies or big big bear bodies. This represents early profit taking, and it increases the chance of a bigger pullback beginning soon.<li>Most important chart pattern for the bears is the streak of 13 consecutive bull bars, which ended April 16.<li>That is the most extreme streak in 10 years. The last similar streak was 15 bars back in February 2011. It led to an immediate 9% selloff. After a brief new high, there was a 24% correction.<li>The point is that an extreme streak often leads to a correction that is bigger, and lasts longer than recent pullbacks. Therefore, once there is a reversal down, it will probably be at least as big as the 10% from September and October 2020, and it might last longer.<li>If there is a 20% correction, there might not be another new high this year.<li>I mentioned in the<a aria-label=\"chatroom  (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookspriceaction.com/portal.php?page=9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">trading room</a>on Wednesday just after the open that I shorted and plan to scale in 50 to 100 points higher.<li>Picking the exact top in a strong bull trend is a low probability task. The odds always continue to favor at least slightly higher prices when the Emini is in a strong bull trend. However, It is currently more likely that the next 10% move will be down than up.<li>March and April are the most bullish consecutive months of the year. They were very strong this year.<li>That probably increases the chance of the next seasonal tendency, which is a pullback in May and June. A common trading adage is “Sell in May and go away.”<li>Do not place trades based on calendar patterns. They are not reliable enough, and there are many other far better setups to trade.<li>Bottom line… streak of 13 bull bars, 2 weeks of weak bars, and 5 consecutive bear dojis increase the chance of a 10% pullback beginning in May. If there is a strong reversal down next week, it would probably be the start of a 10%, 2-month correction.</ul><h2 id=\"9-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This is a Breakout Mode pattern.<li>Only 2 strong bull bars in past 11 days, even though strong bull trend in March and April.<li>Streak of 13 bull bars that ended April 16 is probably an exhaustive move. Traders should expect a 10% correction to begin in May or June.<li>Last week was a bear reversal bar, and therefore a sell signal bar for this week.<li>The next couple of reversals down might fail, like all of the prior attempts. There might be one or two more new highs before a correction begins, but the Emini will probably not go much higher before there is a 10% correction. The correction should lead to a 2-month trading range.<li>Picking a top is a low probability bet. There have been many tops since the pandemic low, and all failed. It is always more likely that a top will fail and that there will be another new high.<li>But it is increasingly likely that there will be a 10% correction. Experienced traders can begin to scale into shorts, but they need to trade small and use a wide stops.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Up 14 points in the Globex session.<li>5 consecutive bear days in a bull trend is unusual. Today should close above the open and be a bull day on the daily chart.<li>Bulls also want a close above Friday’s high, which would increase the chance that last week was just a bull flag. They would expect higher prices and a new all-time high this week.<li>Bears hope last week will be a top. They need a close below the 5-day tight trading range. If they get a close on the low of the day, and far below last week’s low, traders will expect at least a couple legs sideways to down.<li>5 consecutive doji bars in a tight trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. Traders are deciding if it is a bull flag or a top. There is an increased chance of a strong trend up or down.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-3.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day. 5 consecutive bear doji bars on daily chart.\"></a><figcaption>Above is the version that I post every day.

Emini streak of 6 consecutive bear days.<li>6 consecutive bear bars is rare, especially in a bull trend. Increased chance of bull body tomorrow.<li>However, also increased chance of big bear day. This is because the streak represents sustained profit taking, even though only small so far.<li>Additionally, it follows rare streak of 13 bull days in April, which might be a blow-off top.<li>Last week is sell signal bar on weekly chart. If today falls below last week’s low, it will trigger a weekly sell signal.<li>Bulls need consecutive closes above Thursday’s all-time high, which was the April high, to make traders believe that the bull trend is resuming.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Down 20 points in the Globex session so should have a big gap down. That will support the daily sell signal and probably the weekly sell signal as well.<li>Bears want this to be the start of a selloff for a few weeks.<li>Bulls want the sell signals to fail, and for the bull trend to resume.<li>After 6 consecutive bear days on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of today closing above the open. If the Emini is within 10 points of the open in the final hour, it will probably get drawn to the open. Then, traders will decide if today will finally be a bull day.<li>Big gap down means Emini will be far below the EMA, which is a measure of the average price.<li>Bears do not like to sell far below average. They want the Emini to go sideways to up to the EMA. They then look for a double top or wedge top to sell.<li>A big gap down is bearish, but bulls expect the Emini to test the EMA. They will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom for a reversal up to the EMA.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down, the day could form a Trend From The Open. That happens about 20% of the time. More likely, the Emini will enter a trading range for the 1st 1 hour or two.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-4.png\" alt=\"Emini bear channel with 6 consecutive bear days on daily chart.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That happens only once every few years, and it is therefore climactic.<li>Since it is sideways instead of down, it is not a sell climax. It is simply a pattern that has lasted a long time and likely to end. Therefore, today or tomorrow will probably have at least a small bull body on daily chart.<li>The bear bodies are a sign of repeated profit taking, but there has not been enough to create a reversal down.<li>Tight trading range for 4 weeks so Breakout Mode.<li>Since in a bull trend, higher prices are always at least slightly more likely than a strong reversal down.<li>However, the yearlong rally has been extreme, so traders should expect a 10% correction this summer.<li>On 60-minute chart, the 4-week trading range is a head and shoulders top. But a major top only has a 40% chance of leading to a bear trend. Sideways or up are slightly more likely.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Up 1 point in the Globex session so probably will open within yesterday’s range.<li>If gaps down, gap will be small, and small gaps usually close in 1st hour.<li>Trading range for 4 weeks, and most days have had at least one swing up and one swing down. Day traders will expect reversals again today.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour, then might get strong trend day.

Emini may see bulls rally resuming.<li>There was another streak of 8 bear bars in 2005, and a streak of 10 bear bars in 2017. Therefore, this streak is extreme.<li>Still in tight trading range, so Breakout Mode.<li>Yesterday was a big bull outside up day at the 20-day EMA in a bull trend. That increases the chance of a breakout above the 4-week tight trading range.<li>Yesterday had a Major Bull Surprise reversal up. That increases the chance of higher prices today.<li>If today is a big bull day, it would confirm yesterday’s rally, and increase the chance of higher prices over the next couple weeks.<li>If today is a bear day, then the trading range is still intact.<li>Today is Friday, so weekly support and resistance can be important.<li>Bulls want week to close above open of week, so week would have bull body.<li>Bulls want week to close above last week’s high, which was the all-time high.<li>Bears want week to close below last week’s low, since last week was sell signal bar.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Up 12 points in the Globex session, so today might gap above yesterday’s high.<li>Today is important. There is an increased chance of a bull trend day after yesterday’s strong rally.<li>If there is a series of strong bull bars in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour, day traders will look to buy all day.<li>The Emini has been in a trading range for 4 weeks, and the bulls are hoping that today will break far above the range.<li>They hope yesterday was the start of a leg up on the daily chart, and they want it to last at least a couple weeks.<li>If today breaks above last week’s high, this week will be an outside up week. If it closes near the high of the week, whether or not it is outside up, traders will expect higher prices next week.<li>The bears want the rally that began yesterday to reverse down from the top of the range. They want the trading range to continue, and therefore need the Emini to reverse down over the next few days from around the top of the range.<li>If there is a series of strong bear bars in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour, today could be a bear trend day.<li>Because yesterday’s rally was unusually strong, if today is going to be a trend day, up is more likely.<li>Most days over the past month have had at least one swing up and one swing down. While yesterday was strongly bullish and today might gap up, day traders know that the odds always favor a lot of sideways trading. They therefore will expect to trade in both directions unless there is a clear trend.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-wedge-bottom-then-major-bull-surprise-and-leg-1-leg-2-meausured-move.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-7.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom then major bull surprise and leg 1 = leg 2 measured move.

It is based on the June 5, 2020 high, which was tested twice (September and again end October).<li>Closed near the high of the week, so might gap up next week.<li>Small Pullback Bull Trend since pandemic low last year.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend rarely lasts more than about 60 bars.

Friday confirmed the reversal and it makes at least slightly higher prices likely next week.<li>Consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs is a Bull Surprise, which typically will have at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up. Therefore, the bulls will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>1- to 3-day pullback.<li>Friday was also a breakout above the 4-week trading range.<li>Monday is the follow-through bar. If it is a bull bar, especially a big bull bar closing near its high, it would increase the chance of a rally that could last a couple weeks. Traders would look for a 100-point measured move up, based on the height of the trading range.<li>If Monday is only a small bull bar, it will make at least slightly higher prices likely next week.<li>If Monday is a bear bar, especially a bar closing near its low, traders will conclude that Friday’s breakout failed. They would then look for the 4-week tight trading range to continue.<li>Tight trading range late in a bull trend usually is the Final Bull Flag. That increases the chance that a rally from here will reverse down within about 5 weeks.<li>A reversal down, whether or not there is a measured move up, could be the start of a 10% correction.<li>There have been many reversal attempts since the March low. All failed within a few days.<li>While a 10% correction is likely this summer, picking the exact top is a losing strategy. It is always more likely that the Emini will resume up after every reversal attempt.<li>The bears need consecutive big bear bars before traders will conclude that the 10% correction is underway.<li>In a bull trend, a correction is not clear until it is already half over.</ul><h2 id=\"7-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders should expect at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to down after a 1- to 3-day bounce.<li>If there is a lower high and a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg down, there will be a lower high major trend reversal. That would have a 40% chance of leading to a 10% correction.<li>Is this the start of a 10% correction? Unless the bears get follow-through selling today, or a strong reversal down from a lower high this week or next, the odds will continue to favor a new high after every 1- to 3-day selloff.<li>But the odds are also that one of these brief selloffs will grow into a 10 – 20% correction this summer. The correction will not be clear until it is about half over.</ul><h4>Consecutive outside bars on weekly Globex chart</h4><ul><li>On weekly chart, this week so far is a big bear trend bar and it broke below last week’s low.<li>On the weekly Globex chart, this week is an outside down bar, and last week was an outside up bar. Consecutive outside bars is an OO (outside-outside) pattern.<li>That is a Breakout Mode pattern. Since it is coming in an overbought market, it increases the odds of lower prices if the Emini trades below this week’s low at any point in the next several weeks.<li>Since there is now an OO on the weekly chart, traders will pay a lot of attention to the rest of the week and to next week. If this week closes near its low and then next week breaks below this week’s low, the odds will shift in favor of a 10% corrections.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Down 27 points in the Globex session, but sharp reversal up in past 15 minutes from sell climax to below the 4,100 Big Round Number.<li>Traders are deciding if the yearlong bull trend is beginning a leg down over the next month or two.<li>If it is, the bears will create surprises. That means they will do things that are unexpectedly strong.<li>For example, today might become a big bear day closing far below the 4-week trading range.<li>Or, this week could close far below last week’s low.<li>Until the bears clearly take control, the odds will continue to favor new highs before there is a 10% correction.<li>Yesterday reversed up but then entered a trading range.<li>Today will probably gap below that range, but it will probably not gap below yesterday’s low.<li>Because the 2-day selloff was surprisingly strong and at support, there is an increased chance of a trend day in either direction.<li>Trading range trading is always more likely than trends. Yesterday went sideways after a strong selloff down to support. That increases the chance of it going sideways again today.<li>Traders might wait until the end of the week to decide if this is the start of a 10% correction, or just another pullback in the yearlong bull trend.<li>If there is a series of strong trend bars up or down on the open, the odds of a trend day will go up.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-gap-down-and-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal-680x383.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-12.png\" alt=\"Emini gap down and sell climax and bull trend reversal.

Traders expect every strong leg up or down to reverse.<li>The EURUSD has been sideways for 4 weeks, and it is back in the January/February range. There is now a 5-month trading range, and it is within a 10 month trading range.<li>Since the April rally was strong, the EURUSD might have to go sideways to up for another couple weeks, before the bears might be able to get a leg down to the bottom of the 10-month range.<li>Today is the last trading day of the week. This week so far is a bear bar on the weekly chart. The more this week closes near the low of the week, the more likely next week will trade down.<li>The more this week closes toward the middle or high of the week, the more likely next week will trade sideways to up.</ul><h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>Early strong rally for 1<sup>st</sup>half of overnight session.

They would like today to close near the high of the day, which would increase the chance of higher prices on Monday.<li>Bulls would like today to close above the open of the week, but that is probably too far above, given that there was a 30-pip selloff a few hours ago.<li>The bears want a reversal down, and for today to close on its low. Today would then be a sell signal bar on the daily chart. They currently have only a 20% chance of success.<li>At a minimum, the bears want today to close below yesterday’s high.

It is a Breakout Mode pattern.<li>Traders will theoretically look to sell below this week’s low, and buy above this week’s high. This is true even if the breakout comes several weeks from now.<li>Many traders will not actually sell below or buy above, because the bar is big, and therefore the risk is big.<li>However, once either signal triggers, traders will tend to look for trades in that direction on the daily and 60-minute charts.<li>If one signal triggers but the Emini then reverses and triggers the opposite signal, some traders will reverse.<li>The day session weekly chart (on the left) is almost an OO pattern. The more a market does something that resembles a pattern, the more it will behave as if the pattern actually formed.<li>I am showing the weekly Globex chart to illustrate the OO pattern. Traders can see that the day session’s weekly chart is very similar.<li>Therefore, traders will be bearish if there is a breakout below this week’s low.<li>Also, they will be bullish if there is a breakout above this week’s high on the weekly Globex chart, or the high of 2 weeks ago on the weekly chart of the day (which is slightly above this week’s high).<li>Finally, a breakout of a Breakout Mode Pattern has about a 50% chance of failing and then reversing.

It closed the gap above last Thursday’s high, eliminating last week’s 3-day island bottom.<li>Today will probably gap down. That will create a 3-day island top. Remember, last week’s gap up created a 3-day island bottom, and I always point out that island tops and bottoms are usually minor reversal patterns.<li>Traders are wondering if the 2-day rally is reversing down from a lower high in bear trend (major trend reversal), or simply having a pullback.<li>Today will give traders useful information about what to expect over the next couple weeks.<li>If it is a big bear day and it closes on its low, the odds will shift back in favor of the bears.<li>If today is a big bull day, traders will see last week’s reversal up as still intact.<li>If today is a small bull or bear bar, especially if it closes in the middle third, it would increase the chance of more sideways trading.</ul><h2>Breakout Mode on the daily and weekly charts</h2><ul><li>Last week reversed down from above a month-long trading range, and then up from below the trading range.<li>A 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal has a higher probability of success.<li>Since the Emini is still in the its 5-week trading range, the bulls have only a slightly higher probability of a break above the top of the range, before there is a break below.<li>On the weekly Globex chart, there are consecutive outside (OO) bars. That is a Breakout Mode pattern.<li>However, the trading range alone is a Breakout Mode pattern. The OO increases the chance that the breakout up or down will lead to a 200-point measured move, based on the height of the trading range.<li>Traders are deciding if the rally last week was only a pullback from the break below the range, or a reversal up from a failed breakout below.<li>Last week’s 2-day rally was strong enough to make a reversal up more likely than a bounce in a new bear trend.<li>But if the bears get a big bear bar today or tomorrow, the odds of a bear breakout of the 5-week trading range will be greater than of a bull breakout.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>With today’s big gap down, the selling might continue for an hour or two.<li>Since yesterday was in a sell climax for only half a day, it might sell off strongly for the 1<sup>st</sup>half of today as well.<li>But, when once a sell climax lasts 50 or 60 bars, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading. However, that means there is a 25% chance of a big bear trend day.<li>Therefore, if there is an early bear trend, it will probably convert to a trading range, or reverse up in the middle of the day.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-trading-range-then-bear-breakout-and-closed-the-gap-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-19.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range then bear breakout and closed the gap.

The bulls need closes above that high, for traders to look for a measured move up, based on the double bottom. That target is above the all-time high of 2 weeks ago.<li>The Emini has been sideways for 6 weeks, which is typically neutral.<li>It is slightly more likely to have a bull breakout than a bear breakout. This is because last week reversed down from a failed breakout above the range, and then up from a failed breakout below. A 2<sup>nd</sup>failed breakout has a better chance of leading to a trend.<li>The trading range is 200 points tall. Traders are therefore looking for a measured move up or down.<li>If today is a 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive big bull day, which is unlikely, traders will be more confident that the bull trend is resuming, even though the Emini is still in its 6-week trading range.<li>The bears want a reversal down from a double top with the neckline of the double bottom. It today is a big bear day, it would reduce the bullishness. The bears need a break below the trading range to switch the odds in favor of a measured move down.<li>If today reversed down from below last Friday’s high, the Emini might form a triangle. There would then be a lower high after Wednesday’s higher low. The bears would then have close to a 50% chance of a break below the 6-week trading range.<li>If today has a small bear body, the odds will continue to favor a breakout above the range.<li>After 2 big bull days, today probably will not be a 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive big bull day. This is especially true since the Emini is still in its 6-week trading range.</ul><h3>Weekly support and resistance</h3><ul><li>Today is Friday, so weekly support and resistance can be important.<li>After the strong selloff early in the week, the Emini yesterday got back above the open of the week (but closed just below it). That is the most important magnet on the weekly chart.<li>A close above, especially far above, would increase the chance of higher prices next week. This week would then be a good High 1 buy signal bar.<li>The bears would need a close near the low of the week, for traders to expect lower prices next week.

The bulls need closes above that high, for traders to look for a measured move up, based on the double bottom. That target is above the all-time high of 2 weeks ago.<li>The Emini has been sideways for 6 weeks, which is typically neutral.<li>It is slightly more likely to have a bull breakout than a bear breakout. This is because last week reversed down from a failed breakout above the range, and then up from a failed breakout below. A 2<sup>nd</sup>failed breakout has a better chance of leading to a trend.<li>The trading range is 200 points tall. Traders are therefore looking for a measured move up or down.<li>If today is a 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive big bull day, which is unlikely, traders will be more confident that the bull trend is resuming, even though the Emini is still in its 6-week trading range.<li>The bears want a reversal down from a double top with the neckline of the double bottom. It today is a big bear day, it would reduce the bullishness. The bears need a break below the trading range to switch the odds in favor of a measured move down.<li>If today reversed down from below last Friday’s high, the Emini might form a triangle. There would then be a lower high after Wednesday’s higher low. The bears would then have close to a 50% chance of a break below the 6-week trading range.<li>If today has a small bear body, the odds will continue to favor a breakout above the range.<li>After 2 big bull days, today probably will not be a 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive big bull day. This is especially true since the Emini is still in its 6-week trading range.</ul><h3>Weekly support and resistance</h3><ul><li>Today is Friday, so weekly support and resistance can be important.<li>After the strong selloff early in the week, the Emini yesterday got back above the open of the week (but closed just below it). That is the most important magnet on the weekly chart.<li>A close above, especially far above, would increase the chance of higher prices next week. This week would then be a good High 1 buy signal bar.<li>The bears would need a close near the low of the week, for traders to expect lower prices next week. That is unlikely.<li>A close in the middle of this week’s range, would increase the chance of a 3<sup>rd</sup>consecutive sideways week.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>After 2 big bull trend days, the odds favor more trading range trading today.<li>However, if the 2-day rally is a resumption of the yearlong bull trend, the bulls should be able to create mostly bull bars on the daily chart.<li>In bull trends, many days rally in the final hour, to create a bull body on the daily chart.<li>Bulls want today to break above the May 14 high, and to close above that high.<li>Bulls want today to close above the open of the week.<li>The more today closes near the high of the day, and of the week, the more likely the Emini will go higher next week.<li>The bears want a bear bar today.

Friday is a sell signal bar for a double top, but there will probably be buyers below. A bull breakout of the range is slightly more likely than a bear breakout due to bulls slight edge.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market on the weekly chart has rallied strongly for 2 months. It is getting near the January 6 high at the top of the 10-month trading range, and there is now a micro wedge. Since the sell signal bar is weak and the bull channel is tight, there will probably be buyers below this week’s low.<h2>EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3>The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-micro-wedge-and-double-top-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-22.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has micro wedge and double top\"></a></figure><ul><li>Bull bar but tail on top, and close in middle so reversal bar.<li>Bull body so weak sell signal bar for micro wedge, lower high major trend reversal, and double top.<li>Because 2-month rally is strong, if there is a reversal, it will probably stop at around the 1.20 Big Round Number, which has been important since August. There is a cluster of support there: 50% retracement; February 5 bottom of the January/February trading range; September 1 breakout point; and, May 5 low, which was the start of the parabolic wedge.<li>Most attempts to break out of a trading range fail, even when the attempt is strong.<li>A double top with the February 25 or January 6 high is more likely than a successful breakout above.<li>The bulls need 2 closes above the January 6 high, to convince traders that the rally is a resumption of last year’s bull trend.<li>Without that, they will continue to believe that the 10-month trading range is intact and that this rally is just a bull leg in that trading range.<li>Weak sell signal bad, but micro wedge at resistance. When unclear like this, usually will not go far up or down.</ul><h2>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3>The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-micro-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-22-1.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has micro wedge buy climax - with bulls slight edge\"></a></figure><ul><li>Strong bull trend since pandemic low. Only 1 pullback (a bar that traded below the low of the prior bar), and it lasted only 1 bar (September).<li>With one week remaining in May, May so far has a small bear body.<li>The bulls want May to be the 4<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar. Since that is extreme and it would be coming late in the yearlong bull trend, it will probably not be a sign that the trend will continue straight up for many more months.<li>More likely, the bulls will feel exhausted within a few bars (months), and start to take profits. Traders should expect a small pullback this summer.<li>This is the 3<sup>rd</sup>leg up. There were pauses in September and January. If May has a bear body, it would be a sell signal bar for a parabolic wedge buy climax.<li>It would be a higher probability sell signal bar if it closes near its low.<li>Because the bull trend is extremely strong, a reversal down would probably only last 2 or 3 months before the bulls return.<li>Since the yearlong rally has been so unusually strong, the correction might lead to a trading range for a year or more.</ul><h3>The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-High-1-buy-signal-bar-in-tight-trading-range-in-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini SP500 futures weekly candlestick chart has High 1 buy signal bar in tight trading range in small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><ul><li>I mentioned last week that there are<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-OO-consecutive-outside-bars.png\" target=\"_blank\">consecutive outside bars on the Globex weekly chart</a>, and that is an OO pattern. An OO is a Breakout Mode pattern, which typically has a 50% chance of a bull breakout, and a 50% chance of a bear breakout.<li>The high of last week’s Globex OO bar is at the top of the 6-week range, and its low is at the bottom.<li>On the above weekly chart of the day session, the pattern is similar. There is a 6-week trading range, which is also a Breakout Mode pattern.<li>This week was an inside bar. It is a High 1 buy signal bar for next week. Since it was a perfect doji bar, it is not a strong High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for next week. This makes a strong rally next week less likely.<li>Since it is an inside bar after a reversal down, it is also a Low 1 sell signal bar.<li>A doji in a tight trading range in a Small Pullback Bull Trend is a low probability sell signal.</ul><h4>Late in Small Pullback Bull Trend</h4><ul><li>The Small Pullback Bull Trend has lasted more than 60 bars, which is unusual and therefore will probably not continue much longer.<li>Since there is no reliable top yet, traders expect higher prices.<li>When a Small Pullback Bull Trend ends, it usually does not immediately reverse into a bear trend. A strong bull trend typically transitions into a trading range, before the bears can get a trend reversal.<li>Once there is a correction, traders will expect it to last longer, and fall more than any prior pullback in the trend.<li>The biggest correction so far was a 10% drop that lasted for 2 months (September and October). Therefore, once this Small Pullback Bull Trend ends, there should be a pullback that falls 10 to 20%, and it should last at least a couple months.<li>It could last many months. For example, the Emini went sideways for 2 years after the 2017 buy climax.<li>Once there is a trading range, it will have both buy and sell setups, as all trading ranges do.<li>If the trading range has a reasonably good sell setup, the bears will have a 40% chance of a reversal into a bear trend.</ul><h3>The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-double-top-major-trend-reversal-and-double-bottom-bull-flag-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-22-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has double top major trend reversal and double bottom bull flag in trading range\"></a></figure><ul><li>Trading range for 6 weeks within yearlong bull trend. Most attempts to break out of a trading range fail, and the trading range can last longer than what seems likely.<li>Traders are looking for a measured move up to 4,400 or down to 3,850, based on the 200-point tall trading range.<li>Reversed up on Wednesday from a double bottom with last week’s low. This week formed a higher low, which is bullish.<li>The consecutive big bull bars this week are also bullish.<li>The bulls on Friday got a breakout above the May 14 high, which is the neckline of the double bottom, but Friday closed near the low of the day, and below the breakout point.<li>Friday is a sell signal bar for a higher high double top with the May 14 high.<li>The daily chart now has both a double top, and a double bottom since the May 12 low. That is a Breakout Mode pattern, and it is within the 6-week trading range, which is a bigger Breakout Mode pattern.<li>A Breakout Mode pattern means that the probability of a successful bull breakout, is about the same as for a successful bear breakout.<li>In this case, the probability is slightly higher for the bulls: the chart has been in a bull trend for a year; Friday has a smaller bear body than the bodies of the consecutive bull bars of the prior 2 days; and, last week reversed down from above the month-long trading range, but then reversed up from below, and a 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal is more reliable.<li>Summary: 6-week trading range is Breakout Mode, as is the double top following the double bottom of the past 2 weeks. The probability of a bull breakout is slightly higher than for a bear breakout.</ul><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

A 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal is higher probability.<li>Friday is sell signal bar for double top lower high major trend reversal.<li>Probably more buyers than sellers below Friday’s low since: the Wednesday/Thursday rally was very strong; it broke above the May 14 high, which is the neckline for the double bottom; and, Friday was not a big bear bar closing near its low.<li>On weekly chart, last week is buy signal bar for High 1 bull flag. But it was a perfect doji and therefore a weak buy setup.<li>This is the final week of the month. The bulls want May to be the 4<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar. That means they want Friday to close above the open of the month, which could be a magnet all week.<li>The bears want a bear bar on the monthly chart, so that May will be a sell signal bar for a parabolic wedge top on the monthly chart. Traders would then be looking for a possible 2-month pullback.</ul><h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>The Emini is up 20+ points in the Globex session, and just below Friday’s high.<li>Today will likely gap up, and if it does, the gap will probably be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour.<li>Bulls want breakout above Friday’s high, since Friday is a sell signal bar. That could make the bears give up, which would increase the chance of a bull trend today.<li>Daily chart is in Breakout Mode over past 2 weeks, and bulls again trying for bull breakout. Increased chance of bull trend day today.<li>Friday broke out above neckline (May 14 high) of the double bottom, but reversed down.<li>If the bears get a 2<sup>nd</sup>reversal down today, Emini will probably pull back for at least a couple days. Traders will watch for reversal down from around Friday’s high and then a bear trend day.<li>Odds favor the bulls on the daily chart. They want at least a bull day today, which would increase the chance of a breakout this week, and a test of the May 7 all-time high.<li>Middle of 6-week trading range and most days have had at least one reversal. Day traders will expect that again today.<li>If series of strong trend bars in either direction in 1<sup>st</sup>hour, then increased chance of trend day.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-bear-channel-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-24.png\" alt=\"Emini bear channel and then trading range. Pullback from May double bottom rally more likely than double top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle.

Friday is a sell signal bar for the nested wedge and for a double top with the February 25 high.<li>When there is a credible sell setup, and the market does not go down, it will probably go up.<li>5-day tight trading range so Breakout Mode.<li>Friday closed above Thursdays low, so low probability sell setup. Might be more buyers than sellers below.<li>Today so far is a bull inside day. There is a micro double bottom in the 5-day tight trading range. If today is a bull day, it will be a buy signal bar for tomorrow, especially if today closes near its high.<li>Strong bull trend since March low, so once there is a reversal down, it will probably be minor. There might be a 2-week sideways to down pullback, but bear trend not likely this week.<li>Might test down to 1.20 Big Round Number, since it is also around 50% pullback, and at bottom of wedge.<li>Bulls want breakout above January high, which is top of 2-year trading range.<li>Most trading range breakouts fail, so probably sellers above or around January high.<li>4-day tight trading range reduces chance of big move up or down today.</ul><h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading on 5-minute chart</h3><ul><li>EURUSD sold off sharply several hours ago, but reversed up just as sharply.<li>Bulls prevented today from trading below yesterday’s low, which would have triggered daily sell signal.<li>Reversal up was strong enough to make a bear trend unlikely today.<li>Sideways for 2 hours in the top half of the 5-day tight trading range.<li>Today will probably be a trading range day, and stay within the 5-day tight trading range.<li>If today breaks above Friday’s high and the top of the range, the breakout will probably not be big. Therefore, today will probably not be a big bull day.<li>Since sideways to up is likely, day traders will scalp in both directions.<li>Trend day up or down is unlikely, but if there is a series of strong trend bars, traders will switch to swing trading.<li>The bulls want today to close nears its high, which would increase the chance of a breakout above the February 25 high tomorrow.<li>The bears would like today to be a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive bear day, but the odds favor a bull day today. The bears instead will try to get today to close below the midpoint of the range, to continue the 5-day tight trading range and reduce the chance of a bull breakout.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-5-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then wedge top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.
