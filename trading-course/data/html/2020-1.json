There is always a little more excitement and uncertainty at any major milestone like this.<p>Everyone knows that the Emini is overbought. But Friday was another High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the daily chart. The bull channel on the weekly chart is tight and the trend up is strong. The odds favor higher prices, even if Friday’s selloff leads to a 2 week pullback. In fact, Friday’s late rally was so strong that today might gap up. There would then be a gap up on the yearly chart. I do not know if that has ever happened in the history of the stock market.<p>Markets often have surprisingly big moves up or down around the 1st of the year. With the Emini overbought, the bears might be able to get a quick selloff. However, Friday’s strong rally makes at least slightly higher prices likely today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 18 points in the Globex session. It might gap up to a new all-time high. There would therefore be a gap up on both the monthly and yearly charts. However, the gap would be small and small gaps typically soon close. “Soon” means within a few bars. On the yearly chart, that could be a few years!<p>Friday’s late rally was unusually strong. It was therefore unsustainable and climactic. A strong buy climax typically attracts profit taking. Traders should expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour today and lasting at least a couple hours.<p>A big gap up slightly increases the chance of a trend day. The odds of a bull trend are slightly greater than the odds of a bear trend. Traders should therefore be ready for a swing up or down on the open. However, they should expect a trading range to begin by the end of the 2nd hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Emini-strong-rally-at-end-of-month-and-year-and-decade.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini strong rally at end of month and year and decade\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Friday was an outside day. An inside day after an outside day is an inside-outside-inside, or ioi, Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Since it is coming a the top of a trading range, today will be a sell signal bar for tomorrow. The bears will look for a swing down from a double top with the August high.<p>I have written repeatedly for 18 months that every breakout attempt up and down was more likely to reverse than successfully breakout. Markets have inertia and have a strong tendency to continue their recent behavior.<p>While a trend up to 1.18 is still likely in 2020, the rally will probably be a bull leg in a 2 year trading range and not a strong bull trend. Consequently, it will pretty much be the opposite of the 18 month selloff. Traders will continue to look for 2 – 3 week legs up and down.<p>During the past 18 months, the channel had lower highs and lows. This year, the channel will probably be up and have higher highs and lows. Today might be the start of a 2 – 3 week pullback.<p>The 3 month rally has been the strongest one in 2 years. It is more likely than not that it will continue up to 1.18 this year. This is true even if there is another new low first. However, today is the 2nd reversal attempt at the top of the 6 month range. That increases the chance of a leg down for a few weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has drifted down overnight. Since the selloff has not been strong, it will probably convert into a trading range soon.<p>Once it does, the bulls will begin to buy reversals up. The bears will sell rallies. The result will probably be a small trading range day.<p>Trading will probably continue to oscillate around the 1.12 Big Round Number. That has been important resistance for several month. It was support last summer.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-ltrend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bears wanted 2020 to be an inside bar. However, the bulls got a reversal up from a wedge bottom and the Emini finally broke above the 2019 high at the end of the day.

On a yearly chart, last year was a big bull bar closing on its high, late in a bull trend. That increased the chance of at least slightly higher prices at some point this year on the yearly chart.<p>On the open yesterday, the Emini hit last year’s high exactly to the tick. The Emini then reversed down. However, after a wedge bottom, the Emini reversed back up to above the 2019 high at the end of the day.<p>Because yesterday ended in a buy climax and a breakout above a key price (last year’s high), the rally might have simply been a blow-off top. It might have been a buy vacuum test of major resistance.<p>Even if the bears get a reversal down within the next couple of weeks, it probably would be minor. That means it would last 2 – 3 weeks. The odds continue to favor at least slightly higher prices until the bears create a stronger top or get a surprisingly strong reversal down.<p>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The most important prices are last week’s high and low and the open of the week. This week is an outside up week and the bulls want the week to close above last week’s high.<p>The bears want the week to close below the open of the week to create a bear body on the weekly chart. They would prefer this week to close below last week’s low. This week would then be an outside down week after a buy climax. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini sold off more than 50 points overnight, totally reversing yesterday’s buy climax. Today might even gap below yesterday’s low. If the gap stayed open, yesterday would then be a 1 day island top in a buy climax.<p>If today opens around yesterday’s low, there will be an increased chance of a big bear trend day. All of the bulls who bought yesterday and all of the bulls who bought over the past couple months will be wondering if the 3 month rally was a blow-off top. If the bulls begin to take profits, more and more bulls will sell as the price falls, increasing the selloff.<p>Sometimes after a big bull day in a bull trend, the next day opens near the low of the bull day. If that day begins to trend, the day can become a big bear day. If there is a big bull day and the next day opens near the low of the bull day and then becomes a big bear day closing near its low, it is a sell signal on the daily chart. It often leads to a bigger reversal down than what traders thought was likely.<p>The bulls know that and they will try to prevent today from being a big bear day closing near the low. Since the pattern I just described is rare, today will probably not be a big bear day closing on the low. More likely, the week will close around the middle of the week. This week would then be more of a doji bar on the weekly chart.<p>But if the bears do get a bear day today, the bar on the weekly chart would be an outside down bar. After a buy climax, that would increase the chance of a deeper pullback this month.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-ltrend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is an ioi sell signal, and it triggered overnight when today traded below yesterday’s low.<p>Most attempts to break above or below a trading range fail. The bears might get a 2 – 3 week pullback to the middle of the range.<p>It is important to remember that the weekly and monthly charts are still in bear channels. However, this 3 month rally was the 1st rally in 16 months to break above the bear channel. That reduces the odds that this selloff will go to a new low. But it if does, traders will buy a reversal up, just like they did with every new low for 16 months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off 50 pips overnight in a parabolic collapse. Because that is a sell climax, traders should expect the selling to stop soon.<p>It might have ended in the past hour. While the bulls want the 25 pip bounce to reverse the entire overnight selloff, a tight bear channel normally leads to a trading range. After 20 or more bars in the range, the bulls will have a better chance of getting a reversal up into a bull trend. Consequently, the overnight bear trend is probably converting into a trading range. The range will probably last at least a couple hours.<p>The bears want today to close near its low. This is Friday. If today closes near the low, the weekly chart will have a strong sell signal bar.<p>The bears see the 3 month rally as a Low 2 bear flag and hope that the bear trend resumes. Day traders will therefore be fighting today over the close of the week. The bears will sell rallies and the bulls will buy selloffs.<p>The bears do not need the low to be any lower than it currently is. This week would still be a good sell signal bar if today simply closed near the overnight low. That lack of incentive and the overnight sell climax reduce the chance of a continued bear trend today.<p>The reversal up so far has not been strong. Day traders are expecting a trading range for at least 2 hours and probably all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-gap-down-and-then-bull-major-surprise-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini gap down and then bull major surprise bar\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That was a Bull Major Surprise Bar, which made a bear trend unlikely. The Emini was sideways to higher for the rest of the day.<p>Because the Emini closed just below the open of the week, the candlestick on the weekly chart is a bear doji. That is a neutral bar. Neutral means not as bullish as the Emini has been for 3 months. Traders are wondering if there will be 2 – 3 weeks of profit-taking in January. Since this week is not a good buy or sell signal bar, the Emini might have to go sideways for another week or two as traders wait for clearer patterns.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That increased the chance of at least slightly higher prices at some point this year on the yearly chart.<p>On the open yesterday, the Emini hit last year’s high exactly to the tick. The Emini then reversed down. However, after a wedge bottom, the Emini reversed back up to above the 2019 high at the end of the day.<p>Because yesterday ended in a buy climax and a breakout above a key price (last year’s high), the rally might have simply been a blow-off top. It might have been a buy vacuum test of major resistance.<p>Even if the bears get a reversal down within the next couple of weeks, it probably would be minor. That means it would last 2 – 3 weeks. The odds continue to favor at least slightly higher prices until the bears create a stronger top or get a surprisingly strong reversal down.<p>Today is Friday and therefore weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The most important prices are last week’s high and low and the open of the week. This week is an outside up week and the bulls want the week to close above last week’s high.<p>The bears want the week to close below the open of the week to create a bear body on the weekly chart. They would prefer this week to close below last week’s low. This week would then be an outside down week after a buy climax. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini sold off more than 50 points overnight, totally reversing yesterday’s buy climax. Today might even gap below yesterday’s low. If the gap stayed open, yesterday would then be a 1 day island top in a buy climax.<p>If today opens around yesterday’s low, there will be an increased chance of a big bear trend day. All of the bulls who bought yesterday and all of the bulls who bought over the past couple months will be wondering if the 3 month rally was a blow-off top. If the bulls begin to take profits, more and more bulls will sell as the price falls, increasing the selloff.<p>Sometimes after a big bull day in a bull trend, the next day opens near the low of the bull day. If that day begins to trend, the day can become a big bear day. If there is a big bull day and the next day opens near the low of the bull day and then becomes a big bear day closing near its low, it is a sell signal on the daily chart. It often leads to a bigger reversal down than what traders thought was likely.<p>The bulls know that and they will try to prevent today from being a big bear day closing near the low. Since the pattern I just described is rare, today will probably not be a big bear day closing on the low. More likely, the week will close around the middle of the week. This week would then be more of a doji bar on the weekly chart.<p>But if the bears do get a bear day today, the bar on the weekly chart would be an outside down bar. After a buy climax, that would increase the chance of a deeper pullback this month.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-ltrend-reversal.png\"><img src=\"2020-1-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-Wedge-rally-to-top-of-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-3-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Wedge rally to top of trading range\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a bear inside bar yesterday after an outside bar. This is an ioi sell signal, and it triggered overnight when today traded below yesterday’s low.<p>Most attempts to break above or below a trading range fail. The bears might get a 2 – 3 week pullback to the middle of the range.<p>It is important to remember that the weekly and monthly charts are still in bear channels. However, this 3 month rally was the 1st rally in 16 months to break above the bear channel. That reduces the odds that this selloff will go to a new low. But it if does, traders will buy a reversal up, just like they did with every new low for 16 months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off 50 pips overnight in a parabolic collapse. Because that is a sell climax, traders should expect the selling to stop soon.<p>It might have ended in the past hour. While the bulls want the 25 pip bounce to reverse the entire overnight selloff, a tight bear channel normally leads to a trading range. After 20 or more bars in the range, the bulls will have a better chance of getting a reversal up into a bull trend. Consequently, the overnight bear trend is probably converting into a trading range. The range will probably last at least a couple hours.<p>The bears want today to close near its low. This is Friday. If today closes near the low, the weekly chart will have a strong sell signal bar.<p>The bears see the 3 month rally as a Low 2 bear flag and hope that the bear trend resumes. Day traders will therefore be fighting today over the close of the week. The bears will sell rallies and the bulls will buy selloffs.<p>The bears do not need the low to be any lower than it currently is. This week would still be a good sell signal bar if today simply closed near the overnight low. That lack of incentive and the overnight sell climax reduce the chance of a continued bear trend today.<p>The reversal up so far has not been strong. Day traders are expecting a trading range for at least 2 hours and probably all day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-gap-down-and-then-bull-major-surprise-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini gap down and then bull major surprise bar\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That was a Bull Major Surprise Bar, which made a bear trend unlikely. The Emini was sideways to higher for the rest of the day.<p>Because the Emini closed just below the open of the week, the candlestick on the weekly chart is a bear doji. That is a neutral bar. Neutral means not as bullish as the Emini has been for 3 months. Traders are wondering if there will be 2 – 3 weeks of profit-taking in January. Since this week is not a good buy or sell signal bar, the Emini might have to go sideways for another week or two as traders wait for clearer patterns.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

However, I created a video of what to expect over the coming year and it will be available here soon on my trading course’s website.<p>The<strong>Emini</strong>broke above last year’s high, but there was immediate profit-taking on Friday’s Iran news. The bears want a 2 – 3 week reversal down. However, they will need at least one or two bear bars first.<p>The<strong>Bond</strong>futures are reversing up from the bottom of a 4 month trading range. Any reversal up will probably be minor and last 2 – 3 week.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is stalling at the top of a 6 month trading range. Traders are wondering if the 2 year bear trend has ended and a yearlong trading range has begun. It will probably be in a trading range from around 1.08 to 1.18 for the next year.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Bounce from double bottom</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Treasury-Bond-Futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-double-bottom-bull-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-4.png\" alt=\"Treasury Bond Futures weekly candlestick chart has double bottom bull flag\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures formed an outside up bar this week. There is now a double bottom with the November 7 low. In addition, this week’s low is the 3rd leg down in a truncated wedge bull flag. The 1st two lows were September 13 and November 7. Traders should expect higher prices over the next couple of weeks.<p>The 1st target is the December 3 lower high. If the bulls break above that, then the October 11 and August highs are the next magnets. But, because of the 10 year nested wedge top on the monthly chart, the odds are against a big breakout above the October 11 all-time high. The trend over the next 10 years is down, even if there is one more brief new high 1st.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Stalling at top of 6 month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-4-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has wedge rally\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart reversed down this week after breaking above the October high. That is the top of the 6 month trading range. But, the bears were unable to create a big bear bar closing on its low. Consequently, this week is a weak sell signal bar for next week.<p>While the 3 month rally has been the strongest rally in 2 years, it still looks like a bull leg in a trading range. It lacks relentless buying. The bulls need more consecutive bull bars, more bull bars closing on their highs, few bear bars, and fewer bars with tails above and below. Without those features of a trend, traders will continue to look for reversals every 2 to 3 weeks.<p>Because the 18 month tight bear channel on the monthly chart is unusually long, traders should expect an evolution into a trading range this year. The top of the range will probably be around the September 2018 high. That was the start of the bear channel and it is near the 1.18 Big Round Number. The bottom will either be the October low, or just a little lower at the 1.08 Big Round Number.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong rally, but getting extreme</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-is-breaking-out-above-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart is breaking out above bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;had 4 consecutive bull bars prior to this month. The bulls want another one in January. But the Emini is at the top of a 10 year bull channel. That will probably limit the extend of a rally from here. Also, 4 bull bars coming 10 years into a bull trend is fairly extreme. That increases the chance of a pause within a couple months.<p>But 4 big bull bars closing near their highs is a sign of strong bulls. That limits the downside risk over the next few months. This is true even if the bears were able to create a bear bar in January. The best the bears can probably get over the next few months is a 1 – 2 bar (month) pullback. Traders should continue to expect the Emini to trade sideways to up.<h3>Breakout above last year’s high</h3><p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"I talked last week about the yearly chart. (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-expectations-next-decade/#TR-next-10-yrs\" target=\"_blank\">I talked last week about the yearly chart.</a>That is a chart where each bar is one year. I said that last year was the biggest bull bar in a 10 year bull trend. It was therefore climactic and unsustainable. This year would likely be less strong. Furthermore, within the next 3 years, the Emini will probably begin to go sideways for the next decade.<p>However, this year was likely to break above last year’s high. The bulls accomplished that goal on Thursday, the 1st trading day of the new year and new decade. But it pulled back below last year’s high on Friday.<p>The bears hope that the breakout will fail and that this week will be the high for the year. They want the year to close on its low so that it will be a sell signal bar on the yearly chart.<p>We are only 2 days into the year. The bears currently have only a small chance of achieving their goal at this point. But if they get 2 – 3 consecutive bear bars on the monthly chart, more traders will suspect that we have seen the high of the year.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong bull trend losing some of its momentum</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-4-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart has parabolic wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart traded above and below last week’s range. This week was therefore an outside bar. Its close was near the open and therefore the week was a doji bar, which is neutral. Since last week was small, these 2 weeks are a sign of a loss of momentum.<p>Since the 3 month bull trend has been strong, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 3 bar pullback. Consequently, the downside risk over the next few weeks is small.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Pause in 3 month rally</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-4-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart has parabolic wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for 3 months. However, it has been sideways for 2 weeks. That means that the bulls are not as strong as they have been. This increases the chance of some profit-taking and a 2 – 3 week pullback.<p>The bears want a bear breakout below the 2 week range and then a measured move down. That would be to around the 3 month bull trend line.<p>Can the bears retrace the entire 3 month rally? Probably not without a bigger top. Any reversal down at this point will be minor. The bulls will buy it, expecting at least a test back to the high.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

I’m Al Brooks. I want to spend some time today talking about some monthly charts of important markets, the Emini, bonds, euro versus the dollar Forex market, gold, crude oil, and Bitcoin. This is the start of a new decade as well as the start of a new year, and there are some I think pretty interesting things going on, and they I think will affect more than just the next few months. They’ll impact what’s going on over the next year. I think there will be some major changes taking place in the financial markets.<p>In short, I think that the past decade has been incredibly strong, and it’s like the ’60s, and it’s also like the 1990s. But both of those strong bull trends were followed by Trading Ranges that lasted about 10 years, and the Trading Ranges had very deep pullbacks – 40%, 50%, 60% pullbacks. And I think that is what we’re going to be getting over the next decade. It might not happen right away; it probably will not. But at some point in the next 3 years, I think we’re going to enter a very big Trading Range and it’s going to last a long time.<p>The market has had an incredible Buy Climax. It had one that ended in 2017. We then entered a Trading Range for a couple of years. Now the bull trend is resuming. However, I think what will happen will be similar to what took place in the ’70s and after 2000, 10 years of Trading Range trading. So I’ll begin the PowerPoint right now.<h3>Emini S&amp;P 500</h3><p>This is a yearly chart of the Emini, and you rarely ever get to see a yearly chart. And by yearly chart, what I mean is every bar is 1 year. So this is 1 year, this is another year, this is the past 10 years, and this bar is what took place in 2019. And what do you notice? You see a surge and then a pause. Another surge and a pause. Another breakout and another pause, and then another breakout.<p>But look at this breakout bar compared to the other bars. It’s the strongest breakout bar that we’ve had in a 10 year bull trend, and whenever you get the strongest bull trend bar late in a bull trend, it tends to attract profit-takers. The bulls look at that and say, “Well, I knew it was going to be a bull trend, and at some point I knew I’d have to take profits, but this is a great opportunity to take profits at a very high price. Chances are it’s not going to go up all that far from here. If it goes down, I can buy back at a lower price.”<p>What typically happens after a breakout is you get something that’s neutral. We had a 2-bar breakout and then a doji bar, a 3-bar breakout and a doji bar, a 2-bar breakout and a bear bar. And now we have a very big bull bar, and it covered about as many points as the 2-bar breakout here and the 3-bar breakout here. Chances are next year is not going to be a big year. It’ll be some kind of a pause bar.<p>A pause bar can be simply a smaller body, or it can be a doji bar, or it can be a bear bar, and if you get a bear bar, especially one closing near its low, then traders will look at this as possibly a Parabolic Wedge Buy Climax on the yearly chart. If you have three or more pushes up in a very Tight Bull Channel, that is a Parabolic Wedge Buy Climax, and it usually attracts profit-takers.<p>When the bulls take profits, they’re not going to look to buy again 1 bar later. They typically wait for several bars. If it were a 5-minute chart or a daily chart, you would expect the market to go sideways to down for 10 bars. On a yearly chart like this, I don’t know that it will pull back for 5 or 10 bars. In fact, I don’t think it will pull back for 5 to 10 bars on the first reversal down. It may go sideways for a little bit. But at some point, I do think we’re going to get a pullback, and I do think it will be 5 or 10 bars.<p>Look at this in 2000. Took place in 2000. We had a very, very strong rally, a Buy Climax. It attracted profit-takers, and profit-takers usually want to give the bears two opportunities to take control before the bulls buy again. The bears tried to turn it down here, the bulls bought, and they started to get small bars. Not enough buying. They took profits again. The bears had a second opportunity to turn the market down. They had a Double Top, it broke below the neckline, but it reversed up.<p>This is where the bulls will buy again. They’ll give the bears two chances to reverse the trend. If the bears fail twice, then these bulls will buy again, especially if there’s a good-looking bull bar.<p>I think this is what the next 10 years will be. I think we’re going to go sideways. We may get two pushes down, we may get a Spike and Channel type pattern where it goes down and then a second leg and a third leg down. But this is what the next 10 years will be. I don’t know if it’ll begin in 2020. We may go up for another bar or two before it begins. But I think at some point in the next 3 years, we’re going to do this.<p>You can say, “Oh, no big deal.” It’s a High 2 bull flag. Two legs down, one, pullback, two. Well, but you don’t see the prices all that clearly here, but this retraced about 50% of the entire stock market’s price, and this retraced 60%. And this is not a log chart, so it’s hard to see what 50% would be, but we’re right now around 3200. A 50% retracement would be 1600, around these highs, a pullback to the breakout point above this Double Top.<p>Also, I would expect at least two or more legs sideways to down. So at some point over the next 10 years, I do expect a very big Trading Range. I expect at least a couple legs down, and I expect the Trading Range to last about 10 bars. A yearly chart is 10 years.<p>When you do get a reversal from a Parabolic Wedge Buy Climax or from any kind of a Buy Climax, the first target is the low of the most recent Buy Climax, and the low of the most recent Buy Climax is the low of this year. So that would be the first target. That’s true even if we go up for another bar or two before we come down. That would be the first target, and then you start to look for other targets – maybe this low, maybe this breakout point.<p>So what I’m saying is over the next 10 years, I think we will get at least two pullbacks that are much bigger than what traders have seen over the past 10 years, and that means at least 30%. So I’m guessing we’ll get at least two pullbacks that are between 30% and 60%.<p>You can’t see this back here all that clearly. There was a big rally in the ’60s, and then in the ’70s the market went sideways. You can see there’s a Tight Trading Range here in the 1970s. It lasted about 10 years. Very strong rally in the ’50s and ’60s, and then a 10-year Trading Range, and the Trading Range had two or three legs that fell 30% to 50%. Another example, right? So the market rallied strongly in the 1950s and the 1960s, and then sideways for 10 years with two or more legs, and pullbacks 30% to 50%.<p>Another example here. We rallied strongly for 10, 15, 20 years, and then 10 bars – about 10 bars – two legs sideways to down, with pullbacks of 50% or so. Here we have another big rally, and chances are we’ll do like what we did in the ’70s. Sideways after a big bull trend. We’ll do like we did at 2000. Sideways after a big bull trend. Now we have a big bull trend, and we’re probably going to go sideways. The market is not going to continue to do this. This is extreme behavior. Extreme behavior is unsustainable. It will attract profit-takers.<p>This is an example of a 5-minute chart just to illustrate the point I was making about a Parabolic Wedge. A good bull trend bar, a pause bar. A 2-bar rally, a pause bar. Another breakout, a smaller bar, and then another breakout, and this is the biggest bar in the entire trend. It’s breaking above the top of the channel, and this is what followed. I am expecting that. Here, we were sideways for 60-70 bars. I’m not expecting that, but I am expecting sideways to down for about 10 bars, so for about a decade.<p>I want to say one other thing about these climax bars. When you get a big bull bar late in a bull trend like that, you have to think about what to expect on the following bar. I just showed a chart of the yearly chart, where every bar was 1 year. One thing that’s possible is after a big bull bar, you can get another bull bar. After a big bull bar, you can get a bear bar. After a big bull bar, you can get a small bar. Chances are the current year, 2020, will not be a big bull trend bar on the yearly chart. It probably will be something neutral.<p>One type of neutral bar is a doji bar, where the close is around the open. If this were the yearly chart that I just showed, this would be 2019, and then now, will the current year be a big bear bar? Will it be a doji bar? Will it go above this year’s high and reverse down? I don’t know, but I suspect that early in the year, we will have a hard time going much above last year’s high. Traders will wonder if we’ll totally reverse last year.<p>Whenever you get a big bull bar late in a bull trend, there are profit-takers, and sometimes you get an immediate reversal. Sometimes you’ll go up and then get a reversal, a sell signal bar. Other times you’ll go up and down and go sideways. So I’m expecting either an attempt at a big selloff or an attempt at a rally, but the rally will probably not go far early in the year. So if we do go above the 2019 high, it probably will not go very far above before it pulls back.<p>Less likely this year will be some kind of big sell signal bar. So either a 2 bar reversal like this – up and then reversing down – or we’ll go up and then reverse down. And again, as I say, I’m expecting sometime in the next 3 years the market to evolve into a Trading Range where there is at least a couple legs with 30% to 50% pullbacks.<p>Well, in fact I do have a yearly chart of the stock market, the 1920s up to the 1980s, and it illustrates the point that I’ve been making. We had a strong rally that lasted a lot of years, and then it transitioned into a Trading Range. Trading Range in a bull trend, bull flag, and ultimately there was bull trend resumption. However, during that Trading Range, I think there are things to be learned here. There were several legs down, and the selloffs were between 30% and 50%. And that went on for more than 10 years, and that’s what I expect will be happening over the next 10 years, probably beginning within the next few years.<p>I think this is an important point that you have to consider. Let’s say a stock is trading at 100 and it loses 50% and it sells off down to 50, and then the market enters a Trading Range and it goes back up to 100. When it went from 100 to 50, it lost 50%. When it went from 50 back up to 100, it gained 100%, and therefore over the next 10 years, if we do in fact enter a Trading Range, traders will look to buy every time the market gets down 30% to 50%. If the market then goes back up to the high, the rally will be 60% to 100%. So they’ll look to buy 30% to 50% selloffs, and they’ll look to take profits on rallies of 50% to 100%.<p>This is the monthly chart. Here’s the bull trend. Began 10 years ago. You can argue that the channel began here, before the bull trend actually became clear. A lot of times that happens. The market transitions from a Trading Range and the bull trend begins before the Trading Range or the bear trend ends. So to me, the bull trend began here, but the bull channel began here. You can see we’re breaking above the top of the bull channel. Typically, if you break above the top of the bull channel, there’s a 75% chance that you will get a failed breakout, a reversal down within about 5 bars.<p>5 bars on the monthly chart is 5 months. The percentage is less than 75% here because of the spacing. Here’s 0.1 and here’s 0.2, a lot of space between those two, and here’s 0.2 and 0.3. Not much space. When the spacing is not very symmetrical, when there’s a very big number of bars between 1 and 2 compared to between 2 and 3, fewer traders or fewer computers pay attention to the channel. They think it’s a less reliable channel, and therefore the probability of a failure and a reversal down within 5 bars is less. However, it’s still I think better than 50%. There’s a 60% chance that at some point in the next 5 months, we’ll try to reverse back down.<p>When you break above a channel and reverse, the first target is a test back to the middle of the channel. In this case, it would be around the 20-month Moving Average, so that would be the first target if we were to get a reversal. And if it did not find support at the middle of the channel, it would next try to get down to the bottom of the channel. If it did not find support at the bottom of the channel, then the bulls would look for support around the bottom of the most recent leg up, which would be the 2018 low.<p>Can we go from 4 consecutive bull bars to a reversal? It’s possible, but not likely. Normally, if you have a very strong trend like this and you get a reversal, it’ll be a pullback for a few bars, and the first reversal down will not be successful. So yes, we might get a sharp reversal in the next month or two. I don’t think we will, but if we did, it probably would not be the final high. We probably would need at least some kind of a Double Top or a Micro Double Top before we get back down to the bottom of the channel.<p>This is a weekly chart, and there’s another channel here as well. This channel began a little bit more than about 4 months ago. Three pushes up – one, pullback, two, pullback, three. We’re breaking above the channel. We tried to reverse down below last week’s low. When a bull trend looks like this, usually you’re not going to get a major reversal down, and when a channel is tight like this, your goal is the bottom of the channel, and that’s not very far down. So I don’t think this is a major top. I would not be surprised if we go above last week’s high and form an outside up bar.<p>But I do think we’re probably not going very far up in the next few weeks, and there are several reasons for that. One is we’re at the top of a Wedge channel. Two, we had a 9-bar bull Micro Channel here and then a big doji for the High 1 buy signal. A big doji means the market sold off pretty sharply, and therefore the bears are willing to be aggressive. If the trend resumes, traders are aware that the market sold off here pretty strongly. There’s a higher chance of another attempt to reverse down.<p>When the channel looks like this and we have no bear bars in about 5 or 6 weeks, chances are this reversal is not going to lead to a significant reversal down. The bears will probably need some kind of a Micro Double Top or a second sell.<p>So let’s say this week – today is New Year’s Day. Let’s say this week on Friday, it goes outside up. The next week might become an inside bar, and then we’ll have an ioi (inside, outside, inside) bar. That would be a second sell signal. Last week is the first sell signal bar, a bull body, not very good, and then if we have an inside bar next week, that would be a second sell signal bar. The bears would have a better chance of a pullback, maybe to the bottom of the channel, maybe to the breakout point above this high.<p>Unlikely to get a big reversal down when a bull trend looks like this without going sideways for several bars first. So pretty Tight Bull Channel, had to go sideways for 5 weeks or so before the bears could get a big reversal down. Pretty good rally, had to go sideways for several weeks, Micro Double Top – up, down, up, and then down. So not a lot of downside on the weekly chart. At least, it does not look like it right now.<p>Daily chart, we’re at the top of another channel. Different ways to draw it, but this is a reasonable way to draw it. The channel began in October, and we also have a smaller channel here with three pushes up – one, two, three – so there’s a small Parabolic Wedge. You’d expect a couple legs sideways to down. We have one and we have a pullback. The bulls are hoping for a High 1 bull flag and a resumption of the bull trend.<p>Very strong bull trend. Look at the pullbacks. 1-bar pullback, resumed up. 1-bar pullback, 1-bar pullback, 1-bar pullback. 2-bar pullback, 1-bar, 1-bar, right? So traders have been buying any time – even here. We fell 3 bars, but they bought aggressively. You have to assume the bulls will be buying this as well. So if we do get down to the bottom of the channel, we may have to go sideways and get some kind of a Double Top. So down, up, and then down. The Double Top, it could be a slightly Lower High, it could be a perfect Double Top, it could be a Higher High. However, we’re at the top of the channel, so you’ve got to be thinking about a reversal. We have a small Parabolic Wedge, so you’ve got to be thinking about a reversal as well.<p>So will we get a slightly Higher High Double Top? I think that we probably will because the bulls will be determined to carry forward the strong rally that we had in 2019. They want to get above last year’s high. Last year’s high was also last week’s high. It’s this high right here. That’s the all-time high, and it’s the high of 2019.<p>The bulls are hoping to convince traders that 2020 will be equally strong. It’s not going to be. However, they’ve been buying aggressively for 10 years. They’ve been buying aggressively on the daily chart for several months. They probably will be able to get above last week’s high, which was last year’s high. So it’s the all-time high. So I do think we’ll probably get above last year’s high, but I suspect we’re not going to get much above before we have a pullback for a couple of weeks. This is also at the big round number, 3250. The high right now is 3251, 1 point above the big round number.<p>So, near term in the Emini. We may pull back for a couple weeks or we may go sideways, maybe a little bit higher, and then pull back. But for the year, I think it’ll be a much more neutral year. As I said, it could be a doji bar where we rally, we sell off, we finish the year just around where we started. And then at some point in the next 3 years, possibly starting this year, the Emini and the stock market will begin a 10-year Trading Range where the selloffs will be big – 30%, 40%, 50%, and we’ll get at least two big selloffs like that. So I don’t think there’s a lot of upside left. Maybe we’ll get up to 3500 sometime this year, sometime in the next couple years, but I really don’t think we’re going to go much higher than that before we enter a 10-year Trading Range.<p>Now remember, I said that if we do go into a 10-year Trading Range, we’ll get 30% to 50% pullbacks, and that means we could easily retrace this rally, and we could easily retrace all the way down to last Christmas’s low.<p>I want to say one other point about that. Last Christmas, if you remember, the market crashed and reversed up on December 26<sup>th</sup>. This year, the market is basically crashing up. This is December 27<sup>th</sup>. The bears are hoping that we’re going to reverse strongly down.<p>The market often tries to do the same thing or the opposite of what it did previously. It often does it around the same time. If I’m talking about a weekly chart, it might do it a certain week and then a month later or 2 months later, at the same date, it might try to do the same thing. On a 5-minute chart, if at 11:00 in the morning the market rallies strongly one day, it might try to rally strongly the next day at 11:00. Or if it reverses down at 9:30 one day, it might try to reverse down at 9:30 the next day, or have an upside breakout.<p>I think it’s unlikely that we’re going to get a huge bull trend this year, but you have to wonder if the bears will try to do the opposite of what the bulls did last year. So last year, December 26<sup>th</sup>, we started a huge rally. This year, December 27<sup>th</sup>is the start of a huge bear trend. I don’t think it is. I think we’ll probably go sideways and then decide whether to go up a little bit more and then sell off or begin to test down.<h3>Bonds</h3><p>Bond futures. I think bond futures are incredibly interesting. We’ve been rallying for decades, and there are different ways to draw a Wedge Top. So about 10 years ago, 11 years ago, we had one, two, three, a big Wedge Top. Within that Wedge Top we had one, two, and three. We broke above that, and we have one, two, and three. We broke above that. And then we have a smaller Wedge – one, two, three. So a nested Wedge Top. You’d expect at least a couple legs sideways to down.<p>Well, we had it. One, pullback, two. The bulls are hoping this is a resumption of the bull trend. However, this is such a major top with so many Wedges nested within it, I think we’re going to get a much bigger reversal down. Also, the bond market tends to operate over the course of decades. Tends to rally for two or three decades, sell off for one or two decades, and we’ve rallied for two or three decades. So I think the bond market’s going to sell off for one or two decades.<p>Whenever you have a Wedge rally, you have to be thinking that the market might come all the way back down to the first pullback after the Wedge rally began. Here’s the breakout, here’s the first pullback. So I think at some point in the next 10 years, we’re going to come down here.<p>Right now, the past year, we rallied very strongly, but a Parabolic Wedge. Three or more pushes in a Tight Channel. We broke out above this high, and you can say, “Well, you broke out above a Wedge Top. Shouldn’t you rally strongly?” Whenever you break above a major top – in this case, a Wedge – in general, 50% chance you will get another strong leg up, maybe a Measured Move based upon the height of this Trading Range. But 50% chance the breakout will fail and you’ll get a reversal down, and that’s what it looks like we’re getting here.<p>We have 4 consecutive bear bars on the monthly chart. It’s unlikely that we’re going to go straight up. If the bulls are lucky, we might go sideways for a few months, but it would take several months before I think the bulls could get a resumption of the bull trend. They’ll probably need 2 or 3 bull bars. They might get a bull bar in January or February, but right now I think we’ll probably get at least a couple legs sideways to down.<p>Will we break below this? Well, for the bears we have a Double Top, a neckline. This is the lowest price between these two highs. Break below that, Measured Move down. It would be somewhere down here. If we do break below this 4- or 5-year Trading Range, traders will start to look for a Measured Move down. That’s what I think we’re going to do.<p>But here, we’re talking about a monthly chart, and a top that took place over the course of 10 years. It’s unlikely that it’s going to suddenly reverse. It’ll take several years to get it to reverse. We’ve been going sideways for several years now. If it’s going to reverse, which I think it will, it probably will start to reverse pretty soon. It’s possible it will go sideways a little bit more. It’s possible that we’ll go a little bit higher and then reverse. But I think we’re at or very close to the high of the next 10 years, and I think at some point in the next 10 years we’ll be back down here.<p>What’s the implication of that? Well, if the bond market goes down, which I believe it will, interest rates will go up. So all this talk about zero interest rates, it’s not going to happen. Also, I’ve written several times how I think it would not happen in the United States simply because America would not tolerate it. If the government sells bonds to raise money, somebody has to buy bonds.<p>For example, you might buy bonds. How would you feel if someone sold you bonds, you bought bonds, you gave them your money, and they told you that “When I pay you back, I’m going to pay you back less than what you gave me. So you give me $100, I’ll give you this bond, and in 10 years or 20 years or 30 years, I’ll buy the bond back from you, but I’ll only give you $95.” No American would ever do that deal, and therefore, negative interest rates, they’re not going to happen. That’s what negative interest rates are. You sell a bond for $100 and when you buy it back, you only give the guy back $95.<p>So it’s not really negative interest rates. It’s not like every year, the guy has to give you money. What it means is when you sell the bond back to the government, they give you less money than what you paid for it. So the effect is that you had a negative rate of return. You hold the bond for 10 years and you get back less money than what you had at the start of the 10 years. So your rate of return was less. But it’s not like every month or every 3 months or every year, you have to pay the government interest for the right to hold the bond. So it’s not really negative interest rates, but it’s a negative return.<p>The United States is the leader of capitalism in the world. The United States has a lot of pride about that. There’s just no way the American public is going to tolerate zero interest rates, so it’s not going to happen. Therefore, it makes it hard for the bond market to go much higher. The interest rates are already fairly low, fairly close to zero, and I doubt they can get much closer.<p>Bond market, big picture: sideways, maybe up a little bit more, but over the next 10 years, quite a bit lower. So interest rates will go up.<p>Weekly chart of the bond market. We had one, two, three pushes up, and then an even bigger Buy Climax, and we sold off – one, two, and three. The bulls are hoping this is a Wedge bull flag. Right now it’s a truncated Wedge. This low is still above that low, so three legs down – one, two, three – and the third leg has not fallen below the second. What is likely is we’re either going to rally from around this low, a Double Bottom, or we’ll go a little bit lower and form an actual Wedge – one, lower, lower – and then bounce. An obvious target would be this area.<p>The bulls hope it’s a Wedge bull flag and the bull trend resumes. I think we’ll have a hard time going much above this high. It’s possible that we go a little bit above it, but if we do, this will probably be the final bull flag and that will probably be the start of a bigger reversal down – for example, the 10 year reversal that I’m expecting in the bond market. But right now, short term, I suspect we’re going to bounce.<p>Everyone sees this as a possible Wedge. When everyone sees it as a possible Wedge, bulls start to buy before it falls below that low, and the result is sometimes this low does not fall below that low, and you start to rally. I call that a truncated Wedge. It’s truncated. The third leg did not fall below the second. But the forces are the same as a Wedge. Bulls are buying because they’re expecting a reversal up, whether or not it goes below that low.<p>Again, upside target here, maybe here. If we go up here, I think this will be the final bull flag. I don’t think there’s a lot of upside. However, we’re at the bottom of a Trading Range that’s tilted slightly down. It’s a possible Wedge, it’s a possible Double Bottom. So over the next few weeks, I expect that we’ll bounce.<p>Can we suddenly break to the downside and quickly fall for a Measured Move? This would be a Wedge bull flag, a bear breakout, possible Measured Move down. It’s possible – I think maybe a 30% chance of that, so 70% chance either we just kind of drift down a little bit more and then bounce, maybe channel down – down for a few weeks, up for a few weeks, down for a few weeks, up for a few weeks. We could do that several more times. But the chance of a collapse and a Measured Move down right now, 30%. I think more likely either we drift a little bit lower and then bounce, or we bounce from around here. Down for a few weeks, up. Down for a few weeks, up. Down for a few weeks, probably we’ll bounce.<h3>EURUSD Forex</h3><p>The euro versus the dollar Forex market I think is especially interesting. This is a monthly chart going back 20 years. We had a very strong bull trend, and we’ve been channeling down. The bulls tried to bottom here. They failed. We got a break to the downside. Then they’re trying to bottom a second time, and we got a pretty good reversal up. Strong enough up, might get a second leg up. I think we will. It’s possible this is one, pullback, two, and we’ve already had the second leg up. But I think this is more of a channel that’s subdivided, and I think it’s a first leg up. This is a pullback, and I think we’ll get a second leg up.<p>Right now, we’re starting to break above the top of this small Wedge channel. So for the bulls, it’s a Higher Low Major Trend Reversal. So a bear trend, pretty good rally, Higher Low, and they’re hoping that we get up here. They’d like us to get all the way up here, but in the next year or so, I think we may only get here. The reason I say that is because it’s a very Tight Bear Channel, and the first reversal up from a Tight Bear Channel is usually fairly minor, and usually the market has to go sideways.<p>I do think it’s more likely than not that we’re going up over the next year, that we’ll get up here. It’s possible that we get up there.<p>Another way to look at this is as a Double Bottom pullback. This is a Double Bottom or Triple Bottom, a breakout, and a pullback. In either case, if you want to call it a Higher Low Major Trend Reversal, Head and Shoulders Bottom – left shoulder, head, right shoulder. If you want to call it a pullback from this breakout after this Double Bottom, all of those descriptions mean the same thing. It means you think we’re going higher. So I think the euro versus the dollar will be up over the next year. Also, this is a lot of bars in a Tight Channel. It’s unlikely to go a lot lower without first bouncing.<p>This is a weekly chart. We have a very strong selloff, so a spike down, and then from there we channeled down. Every time it went to a new low, it rallied. So we’d go down for a few weeks, up for a few weeks. Down for a few weeks, up for a few weeks. It just kept doing that for a year and a half now.<p>What’s different now is when you look at this, it doesn’t look like much, but it’s important. We have 3 consecutive bull bars. The bodies are getting bigger. When’s the last time you’ve seen that? You have not seen it in a year and a half, so on one level, this is the strongest rally that we’ve had in the entire bear channel, and we’re getting a second leg up here. Traders are deciding whether the bear channel will continue. Yes, we broke above this bear trend line, but we have not broken above this high. So we’re getting above minor highs here and here. This is a much more major high, a much more sustained selloff to a new low.<p>Can the bulls start to break above more major highs like this one, or that one or that one? If the bulls do break above a major high, then traders will conclude that the bear trend has ended. Right here, for example, we have a minor high, but if this starts to break out strongly, if we start to get a couple big bull bars closing far above this high and that high, traders will conclude that the bear trend has ended.<p>When a bear trend ends, one of two things happens. Either the market evolves into a Trading Range – which it currently is in – or it goes into a bull trend. This channel is fairly tight. It’s lasted a long, long time. It’s more likely that if this is the start of a rally, it probably will be a bull leg in a Trading Range. It’s unlikely that we’re going to go up strongly like this. It’s more likely it’ll be something of a mirror image of this that will go up and down, up and down, up and down, and that will basically be sideways for a year.<p>And in hindsight, traders will look at this as a bear leg in a Trading Range and this as a bull leg in a Trading Range. I think this is where we’re headed sometime this year, the 1.18 level. The bottom might remain here, around 1.08. It might go a little bit lower. We have a gap over here on the weekly chart, and we did not get particularly close to it, so we may have to get closer or we may have to close it.<p>However, I do not think we’ll go a lot lower. We have a Double Top here, neckline, Measured Move down somewhere down here. We might get down to this Measured Move. We have a Double Top here, neckline, Measured Move is here. So Double Top here, Measured Move, Measured Move, and also around that gap. All of that is around the 1.08 area. So we may come down there before we begin the bull leg in the Trading Range, or the bull leg in the Trading Range may already have started. We don’t yet know. But I do think there’s not much downside, maybe to 1.08, and I also think that we’re going up to 1.18 at some point this year.<h3>Crude oil</h3><p>Crude oil. A huge selloff back here 10 years ago. Then we had a strong selloff here, then more of a channel. One, two, three, so Spike and Channel. You’d expect a reversal up to the start of the channel, which is what we did right here, and then a Trading Range. So we’ve been sideways now 5 or 6 years, and here we have a couple Lower Highs, couple Higher Lows, Triangle, and we’re just starting to break out of the Triangle.<p>The bulls hope that this is a Double Bottom Higher Low, so a Double Bottom Higher Low Major Trend Reversal, and they’re hoping that we get a bull trend out of this, and the bears are hoping that the Trading Range continues, maybe we’ll get up and test this or that, and that ultimately we’ll go down lower – which is what I think will happen.<p>However, we’re fairly low in the 5-year range. We have an obvious magnet here, on top of the Triangle. We have an obvious magnet here, top of the Sell Climax, and up here, the top of the Trading Range. Then we have a breakout point below that low, and we tried to get there here. Could not. Tried here. Bulls trying here. So I think we’re going higher. Again, this is the monthly chart. I think we’re going higher, maybe up to here, but I think we’re going to have a hard time breaking above this red line at any point in the next 5 or 10 years.<p>I think that crude oil has a fundamental problem. The market is moving away from petroleum products and toward more climate-friendly products, so there’s a fundamental issue going on with the crude oil market that will limit its upside. So this might be the all-time high for the remainder of your life. It’s possible that we get back up here, but right now I don’t think we’re going to be doing that any time soon.<p>Whenever you get a Major Trend Reversal with a decent buy setup like this – Double Bottom Higher Low Major Trend Reversal – you have a 40% chance of actually reversing from a bear trend into a bull trend. I think it’s probably less than that, maybe 30% chance that we actually get a bull trend, but I do think better than a 50% chance we’re going higher. So I think this is probably going to end up as a bull leg in this Trading Range and not the start of a bull trend.<p>Sideways for 5 or 6 years. I don’t see any sign that it’s going to change. So I think we sold off, sideways, I think we’ll go up a little bit, maybe up here, but I do not think we’re going a lot higher. So it’s going to be a trading type market. Up for a few bars, down for a few bars, probably all year.<h3>Gold</h3><p>Gold. If you’ve listened to me before, you know I’m not a big fan of the entire concept of gold. I think it’s lost its meaning. There was almost a religious attitude toward gold. People kind of treated it almost like a god, and there’s still a lot of these gold idiots around. By gold idiots – they always think you should buy gold. If gold is going up, they say you’ve got to buy gold because it’s going up. If gold is going down, they’ll say “Oh, you’ve got to buy gold. It’s on sale.” They never have a reason to sell gold.<p>We had a Spike and Channel down, and you’d expect the transition into a Trading Range, and we’ve been in a Trading Range for 6 or 7 years now. Similar to crude oil, we have a Double Bottom and it’s a Higher Low, so Double Bottom Higher Low Major Trend Reversal. Double Bottom Higher Low Major Trend Reversal. We have a pretty good rally here breaking above these highs. We have two legs down – one, pullback, two. It looks like we’re going higher. We might get up to this breakout point here.<p>This is, I think, a reasonably strong bull trend. This close is above that high. We have a second close. This close is above this high and that high. It looks pretty good for the bulls. I don’t know that we’ll go a lot higher. We may test this breakout point. We may get up to this Sell Climax high. But to me it looks bullish, so it looks like we’ll go higher. It’s possible that this will be a final bull flag, that we go up a little bit and then reverse, and come back down to the middle of the range.<p>But right now, to me it looks bullish, so it looks like it’ll either be a little bit higher or possibly up to here. Less likely all the way up to here over the next year. Next few months, it looks like we’ll probably go higher.<h3>Bitcoin</h3><p>Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is fascinating. The reason why I think it’s fascinating is because no one knows what to make of it. They keep putting Bitcoin pundits on television talking about how instead of the market going to 20,000, it’ll go to a million or 2 million or 5 million. That’s crazy, okay? When I look at this chart – when you look at this chart, what do you see? You see big up and big down, big up and big down, and you say, “Oh my gosh, I don’t know what it’s going to do.”<p>That’s right. All those big reversals create big confusion, and big confusion means Trading Range. Trading Range means traders are not confident that it’s going to go a lot higher. They’re not confident it’s going to go a lot lower. So if you short and it goes down, you tend to take profits instead of sell more as it goes down. You tend to take profits. If you’re a bull and you buy and it goes up, you don’t believe it’s going to keep going up, so you take profits. The result is the bulls buy low, they sell high to take profits; the bears, when it gets high, they look at it as a good place to sell and they sell, and they don’t think it’s going to go down all that far. If it goes down, they buy back their shorts. So both the bulls and the bears are buying low, selling high.<p>I think couple things that are interesting. We have a bear channel here and pretty strong breakout, and we’re pulling back. So is this a pullback from this breakout, in which case you’ll expect the bull trend to resume? You can call this a left shoulder of a Head and Shoulders Bottom. I know it doesn’t look like a left shoulder, but it’s a sideways, it’s a pause, and then a bear breakout, and this is a possible head. Strong rally and a possible right shoulder if we reverse up from here. So that’s the bullish case.<p>Bearish case is, well, a Buy Climax. We have a Lower High, a Lower High, we have a Double Top bear flag. Up, down, up, and maybe we’ll break below this support. This is support for a long time. We broke strongly below it. We broke strongly back above it. We’re testing it now. Will we break strongly below it again and get back down here? I don’t know. To me, I think that we’re not going to get back down here without first rallying up to here or up to here.<p>But as far as those bulls talking about the market going up to a million, I think so many traders got burned here that they’re hesitant to buy Bitcoin. I think this is the tulip mania phase, and I think people perceive Bitcoin differently from how they perceived it a couple years ago. A couple years ago, CNBC kept putting on Bitcoin people, talking about how Bitcoin was going to go up to a million.<p>I really was annoyed by CNBC doing that. I understand they’re trying to sell advertising and they want as many eyes watching their station as possible, but I think they did a disservice. People who are talking about emotion rather than logic, they led the viewers to believe that Bitcoin was much more solid and much more important than it really is. I do not think it’s important.<p>I do think the concept is important, the concept of a one world currency, not a fiat currency. Fiat currency simply means the government prints a piece of paper and puts a “one dollar” on it and says by fiat, by rule or by law, “this is now money.” Bitcoin is not owned by any government, and I do think at some point we’ll have some kind of an international currency not controlled by any one government. The Bitcoin and cryptocurrency people are hoping that Bitcoin will be that currency.<p>But as far as transactions go, there’s a fundamental flaw with Bitcoin, and I don’t see any way around it, unless they totally overhaul the algorithm for Bitcoin. The problem is, at least as of a couple years ago – I haven’t looked at it since – the problem is you can only do about 7 Bitcoin transactions a second. There are only enough miners out there to do about 7 transactions a second, and you cannot have 7 billion people using this as the world currency if only 7 transactions can take place a second. MasterCard and Visa, they can do thousands of transactions a second because they’re not dependent upon an algorithm basically solving problems. That’s how Bitcoin transactions take place.<p>And because of that, I just don’t see Bitcoin as being a currency. So it may get some limited use as a currency, but I think it has a fundamental flaw by its design. It’s not usable. You cannot be using it, because if everybody starts to use it – you want transactions to take place instantaneously or within a few seconds, like with your Visa card and MasterCard. It’s impossible to have that happen with Bitcoin. So the logic that everyone will buy Bitcoin and use it as an international currency is just not there.<p>The alternative logic is people will trade it like gold, as a store of value. I just don’t see that either. It’s too much imagination and not tangible. Gold, at least you can touch gold, you can hold gold. You feel like you own something. Here, Bitcoin, I think most people will not relate to it, and I think that it has limited upside as a store of value as well.<p>So from a fundamental perspective, I think Bitcoin has a problem. I think at some point there will be an international currency. It might be a cryptocurrency. But I do not think it’ll be Bitcoin. Or at least, not as Bitcoin currently is configured. If they can change the algorithm substantially so that it no longer is Bitcoin, it’s some other algorithm, but they still call it Bitcoin, then yes, Bitcoin could go up to a million dollars. But as it’s structured right now, I don’t see it doing anything.<p>And you can see we’ve been sideways for a couple of years. You can call it a Triangle. We have a Higher Low, we have a Lower High. So if we rally again and pull down, then we’ll have a Triangle. Three highs – one, two, three – and a Higher Low. BreakOut Mode. I don’t see the market doing much of anything over the next several months, maybe over the next year. The bulls, they might get up to this trend line, but I think they’ll have a hard time breaking above this high. If we get up there, the bears will try to get a Double Top.<p>So it looks like it’s going to be sideways over the next year, and I do not think it can go up the way the pundits on television are saying, because it can only do that based on it being a store of value, an equivalent of gold. And to me, if I’m looking to store value, gold versus Bitcoin, I just like the idea of gold. It’s attractive. There’s other uses to it. Bitcoin is just too – too much of a theoretical concept. It’s not tangible, so it’s hard to relate to it. So I just don’t see Bitcoin going up to a million.<h3>Closing review</h3><p>So I talked about the Emini. I think that the market is going to enter a Trading Range for the next 10 years, and I don’t know if the Trading Range will begin in 2020 or if it’ll begin in the next 2 or 3 years, but I do think it’s going to be sideways for the next 10 years, and I think there’ll be selloffs between 30% and 50%, maybe 60%. I think there will be at least two of them, and therefore people will be trading. If the market falls 30% to 50%, they’ll buy. If it rallies 50% from there, or even 100% from there back up to the old high, they’ll sell. So it’ll be a trader’s market for the next 10 years.<p>Bond futures, I think they’re putting in a major top and that interest rates will work higher for the next decade, maybe longer.<p>The euro versus the dollar, I think we’re at the end of a 2-year bear trend and that will work higher. But because the bear channel has been so tight for the past couple of years, I think the rally over the next year will not be strong. It’ll look like a bull leg in a Trading Range. But I do think the euro will go up to 1.18, and that means I think the dollar will go lower.<p>Crude oil, it’s losing its use. So it has a fundamental problem. It’s being replaced by more climate-friendly energy sources. There will always be some market for crude oil, there’ll always be a need for crude oil products, but the uses that it currently has will slowly melt away. So I think there’s a cap in crude oil. It’s been sideways for several years. It looks like it’s going to rally over the next several months, but I think it’s going to have a hard time ever going back into a strong bull trend.<p>Gold, we had a Spike and Channel down over the past many years, and we’re getting up near the top of the Trading Range. It looks like it’ll go a little bit higher.<p>And Bitcoin I think has fundamental problems that will prevent it from becoming widely used, and so I think there’s a cap on how far up it can go. I think it’s probably going to try to rally over the next several months, but I think it’s probably going to be mostly sideways for the next year.<p>I want to thank everyone for giving me the opportunity to talk today. I hope that you found what I had to say interesting. I hope that you’ll find it helpful with your trading, and I wish you the best in the coming year and in the coming decade. Thank you, and again, I’m Al Brooks.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"></div></article>"

Since it came from the 3rd leg up over the past 2 weeks, the bears are hoping for at least a couple legs down over the next couple weeks.<p>However, the 3 month rally has been in a tight bull channel. That is a strong bull trend. Traders will bet that every top will fail until one clearly succeeds. Therefore, they view Friday as a pullback in a bull trend instead of the start of a reversal into a bear trend.<p>Everyone knows that the daily, weekly, and monthly charts are overbought. But buy climaxes often last longer than what seems likely. The bears will probably need at least a double top on the daily chart before they can begin a 2 – 3 week leg down. Alternatively, if there is a big Bear Surprise Bar or 2 – 3 medium size bear bars closing on their lows, traders will look for a 2 – 3 week pullback. Without some sign of strong bears, traders will continue to bet that every reversal will fail within 2 – 3 days.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 11 points in the Globex session. There will therefore probably be a big gap up.<p>A big gap usually means that the Emini is far above its average price. Many traders prefer to buy closer to the average price. Once measure of average is the 20 bar EMA. Consequently, a big gap up usually leads to an hour or two of trading range price action.<p>Once the Emini gets closer to the EMA, the bulls look for a double bottom or wedge bottom. When the Emini is in that trading range, the bears will try to create a double top or wedge and then a swing down.<p>Friday’s selloff over the final 3 hours was in a tight bear channel. When that happens, the Emini typically converts into a trading range before it can enter a bull trend. That is an additional reason to expect a Trading Range Open.<p>Most days over the past couple weeks have been big and have had swings up and down. Therefore, even if today is a trading range day, the range will probably be big enough for at least one swing up and one swing down.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-outside-down-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-13.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-wedge-bull-flag-in-tight-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-13-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD wedge bull flag in tight bear channel\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has sold off in a wedge bear channel for 2 weeks. But the channel is tight and Friday was not a strong buy signal bar.<p>A reversal up from a tight bear channel is usually minor. Also, the December 6 and 20 lows are magnets below. Consequently, the EURUSD will probably continue at least a little lower, even if it bounces for a few days here. The bulls will then try to create a double bottom with one of those lows.<p>Since the chart has been in a trading range for 6 months, traders expect reversals. Most have come after 2 – 3 weeks. This selloff has lasted a couple weeks. Traders will expect a 1 – 2 week bounce to begin this week or next week. If there is a good buy signal bar and a double bottom, they will look for a 2 – 3 week leg up. There is no sign that the 6 month trading range is about to end.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above Friday’s high. That triggered the wedge bull flag buy signal on the daily chart.<p>But since the setup was weak, there were more sellers than buyers above Friday’s high. The EURUSD immediately reversed down after triggering the daily buy signal.<p>However, the reversal was weak. The overnight range has only been 25 pips. That means that traders are looking for reversals and 10 pip scalps, as they have been for 3 days. They will continue to scalp until there is a big breakout up or down on the 5 minute chart. The lack of energy overnight makes that unlikely for today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>After a trading range open, the Emini rallied in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. But it stalled at Friday’s all-time high and entered a tight trading range. There was some bull trend resumption in the final hour. This increases the chance of a gap up tomorrow.<p>Despite the buy climax on the daily chart, there is no clear top yet. Traders keep buying every 1 – 3 day pullback. But since the buy climax has gone on for a long time, traders expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin at any time. The bears usually need at least a small double top before they can get their leg down. Until then, the odds still favor at least slightly higher prices.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

After breaking to a new all-time high, there was some profit-taking and the rallied stalled. There was trend resumption up at the end of the day. This increases the chance of a gap up today.<p>Everyone knows that the daily chart is overbought. However, traders are still buying every 1 – 3 day pullback. They will continue to do that until there is a clear top or a strong reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 2 points in the Globex session. Since yesterday was a strong bull trend, the rally is unsustainable. It should attract some profit taking by the end of the 2nd hour. That typically results in at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading.<p>Yesterday’s 3 hour tight trading range is obvious support. That sideways trading means that traders thought it was a fair price. They might conclude that it still is a fair price. If so, today could get pulled back down there and go sideways again for an hour or more.<p>A tight trading range late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. It is a magnet and usually draws the market back to it. That is a reasonable downside target if there is a reversal today.<p>When there is a strong bull trend day, like yesterday, there is a 25% chance that it will continue all day today. Therefore, if today rallies on the open and there is no credible top, day traders will continue to buy.<p>More likely, any early rally will fail within a couple hours. Day traders will expect more trading range price action today and sideways to down trading for at least 2 hours at some point.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-14.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It has also been in a trading range for 6 months with most legs up and down lasting 2 – 3 weeks. There is currently no reason to expect this to change.<p>Most reversals come at support or resistance. The December 6 and December 20 lows are obvious support. Traders expect this selloff to continue down to that area over the next week. They will then watch for a sign of a reversal up or a continuation down to the next support at the November 29 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off 40 pips over the past 6 hours It is now below yesterday’s low. The bears see yesterday as a Low 1 sell signal bar on the daily chart in a 2 week bear channel.<p>But it has a bull body and it was the 2nd consecutive bull bar. This is a weak sell signal. Consequently, there might be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>The overnight selloff has been in a tight bear channel. That means the bulls have not yet been buying. However, because yesterday was a weak sell signal, the odds are against today continuing much lower. Therefore, the bears will probably soon switch to selling 20 pip rallies from selling at the market.<p>Once the bulls start to see 20 pip bounces, they will begin to buy tests of the day’s low. That should result in a trading range forming today around yesterday’s low.<p>Can today reverse up strongly from below yesterday’s low? Unlikely. The bars on the 5 minute chart are small and there are magnets below on the daily chart.<p>What about a continued bear trend day? While it is possible, the weak sell signal on the daily chart will make traders want to sell rallies. That reduces the chances of a big bear trend day. The bear trend will probably evolve into a 20 – 30 pip tall trading range for the rest of the day, and close around yesterday’s low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-14-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The rally continued up in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for a measured move. The Emini then collapsed on some China tariff news. After a new low, there was a strong reversal back up, and the Emini finished just above the open.<p>The one bar selloff from the high was a Bear Major Surprise Bar. It therefore could lead to additional sideways to down trading tomorrow. However, the bull trend on the daily chart has been very strong.

After breaking to a new all-time high, there was some profit-taking and the rallied stalled. There was trend resumption up at the end of the day. This increases the chance of a gap up today.<p>Everyone knows that the daily chart is overbought. However, traders are still buying every 1 – 3 day pullback. They will continue to do that until there is a clear top or a strong reversal down.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 2 points in the Globex session. Since yesterday was a strong bull trend, the rally is unsustainable. It should attract some profit taking by the end of the 2nd hour. That typically results in at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading.<p>Yesterday’s 3 hour tight trading range is obvious support. That sideways trading means that traders thought it was a fair price. They might conclude that it still is a fair price. If so, today could get pulled back down there and go sideways again for an hour or more.<p>A tight trading range late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. It is a magnet and usually draws the market back to it. That is a reasonable downside target if there is a reversal today.<p>When there is a strong bull trend day, like yesterday, there is a 25% chance that it will continue all day today. Therefore, if today rallies on the open and there is no credible top, day traders will continue to buy.<p>More likely, any early rally will fail within a couple hours. Day traders will expect more trading range price action today and sideways to down trading for at least 2 hours at some point.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"2020-1-14.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

On the 5 minute chart, there was a huge Bear Major Surprise Bar yesterday at 10:40 pm PST. It was big enough to possibly affect the next several days. A bar like that is always news related. Here, it was due to the China tariffs.<p>However, yesterday’s rally up from a new low of the day and the 60 minute EMA was big enough to create confusion. Confusion typically results in some trading range price action, as it did over the final half of yesterday. The day was a bull doji day on the daily chart, which is a trading range day.<p>As good as the one bar selloff was for the bears, there is no top yet on the daily chart. The bulls will continue to buy 1 – 3 day selloffs.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 6 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably open within yesterday’s range.<p>Yesterday was a doji bar on the daily chart, which represents a neutral market. It was a pause in a strong bull trend on the daily chart.<p>Most days over the past several weeks have had relatively big ranges and at least one swing up and one swing down. Since the daily chart is in a strong bull trend, there are more rallies than selloffs and the rallies have been bigger. Day traders will expect that price action to continue again today.<p>However, the daily chart is in a buy climax. There is therefore an increased chance of either a surprisingly big 1 – 3 day rally to a blow-off top or a big selloff and the start of a 2 – 3 week pullback.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bear-trend-reversal-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-15.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, last week’s buy setup was weak. Furthermore, there are still strong magnets below. Consequently, this rally will probably form a lower high. Most bulls would like to see the December higher lows tested before concluding that the selling has ended. However, if there is a Bull Surprise Bar within the next few days, the odds will shift in favor of a test above the January 1 high.<p>I said yesterday that there would probably be buyers below Monday’s low. This was because Monday was a bull bar and therefore a weak sell signal bar. The bulls hope that Friday was the end of the 2 week selloff. They therefore see the 4 day rally as an early bull trend.<p>Yesterday was a pullback in that trend. But yesterday was a bear bar and the 4 day trend up has been week. Yesterday is therefore a weak buy setup and there will probably be more sellers than buyers above its high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied 25 pips overnight. By going above yesterday’s high, the EURUSD triggered a buy signal. However, since the signal was weak, there were likely going to be more sellers than buyers above yesterday’s high.<p>So far, that has been the case. After a brief break above yesterday’s high, the EURUSD stalled and pulled back.<p>While it is still possible for the bulls to surge strongly above yesterday’s high later today, it is more likely that they will not. Last week’s weak bottom on the daily chart and the 4 day weak rally make it more likely that the EURUSD will continue down at least to the December 20 low.<p>There has been no energy for 5 days. Forex day traders expect a continuation of that trading range price action again today. They will look to sell reversals down and buy reversals up, and scalp for 10 – 20 pips until there is a strong breakout up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls again failed to break above the 3,300 Big Round Number. After selling off to a new low, the Emini bounced and closed in the top half of the range.<p>The late rally is a sign that the bulls will try again tomorrow to break above 3,300. The downside risk is small since the bulls have bought every 1 – 3 day pullback for 3 months.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is a strong bull trend and the bulls have bought every 1 – 3 day selloff. Consequently, the downside risk is small.<p>Yesterday again failed to break above the 3,300 Big Round Number. However, the late rally makes it likely that the bulls will try again today. Today might even gap above that resistance.<p>Can today be the start of a 2 – 3 week selloff? Probably not. After a strong rally, the bears typically need at least a micro double top before they can get a swing down. Therefore, the best the bears can probably get is a brief pullback over the next few days.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 11 points in the Globex session. Since it is above the 3,300 Big Round Number, it might gap above it today.<p>The bulls want a gap up and they want the gap to stay open. If there is a gap up above major resistance, there is an increased chance of a trend day up or down. Because the bull trend is so strong on the daily chart, if there is a trend, up is more likely than down.<p>It is important to remember that the rally on the daily chart is extremely strong. That means it is a buy climax. A buy climax sometimes attracts profit-takers. If many bulls take profits, the Emini could sell off strongly for 2 – 3 weeks.<p>There is no sign of this at the moment. Traders therefore are continuing to buy, knowing that markets have inertia. They tend to continue to do what they have been doing. The Emini has been going up and traders will bet on this continuing until it clearly is not.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-16.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-weak-rally-near-top-of-6-month-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-16-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been rallying over the past week after a small weak wedge bull flag. Unless the rally accelerates soon, it will probably form a double top bear flag with the January 6 lower high.<p>If it turns down there, traders will see the rally as the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top. The left shoulder would be the December 13 high. The bears would then want a break below the December 20 low. That is the neck line. A measured move down would break below the November low.<p>While the bulls have been in control for 4 months, the rally is still only a leg in a 6 month trading range. They need consecutive closes above the January high before traders will conclude that a bull trend is underway on the daily chart.<p>Since trading ranges resist breaking out, it is more likely that this week’s rally is just a small leg near the top of the 6 month range. Traders expect it to fail around the January 6 or the January 1 high. They then expect a 2 – 3 week leg down. All legs up and down for almost 2 years have lasted only a few weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high overnight. However, it reversed down over the past hour.<p>Traders have been buying below the low of the prior day and selling above the high of the prior day for 2 weeks. This is a limit order market and a sign of trading range price action. It reduces the chance of a big trend day. Day traders will continue to scalp reversals on the 5 minute chart until there is a sustained breakout up or down. With the overnight bars being small and the overnight range being small, the odds are that today will be another trading range day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-weak-bull-channel-and-the-Buy-The-Close-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull channel and the Buy The Close rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini gapped above the 3,300 Big Round Number resistance today, but spent most of the day going sideways. However, it was forming higher highs and lows and therefore it was in a bull channel. The bulls bought more aggressively in the final hour and created a strong Buy The Close rally into the close. That increases the chance of higher prices again tomorrow.<p>Because the daily chart is in a buy climax, there can be a sharp reversal down at any time. A gap down tomorrow or next week would create an island top.<p>However, island tops and bottoms are minor patterns. The bulls will probably continuing buying every 1 – 3 day pullback, just as they have been for 4 months. They will continue to do so until there is a clear top and a strong reversal down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was in a weak bull channel, but it trended up strongly into the close. The bulls want follow-through buying over the next few days. The bull trend is extremely strong on the daily charts. Traders continue to expect this melt up to continue higher, even though it is climactic.<p>Yesterday’s late rally was a Bull Surprise. Surprises typically have follow-through. However, the rally was so strong that bulls will look to take some profit by the end of the 2nd hour today. That typically will result in at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. This is especially true in the last hour. There are no important weekly targets nearby. Therefore, the bulls will simply try to get the week to close near its high. However, the bears want a conspicuous tail on the top of this week’s candlestick on the weekly chart. They will try to get a selloff in the final hour.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 11 points in the Globex session and today will probably gap up. The open will likely be far above the EMA. When that is the case, many bulls are hesitant to buy, especially if the first few bars are not big bull bars closing near their highs.<p>Traders do not want to pay a price that is far above average for price action that is not far above average. Consequently, a big gap up usually results in an early trading range. The bears hope for a double top or wedge top and then a swing down.<p>The bulls want to buy closer to the EMA. Once the Emini goes sideways to down the to the EMA, they will look to buy a double bottom or a wedge bottom for a swing up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-17.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull channel and the Buy The Close rally\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-below-Low-2-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-17-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to far below yesterday’s low. Yesterday was a Low 2 bear flag sell signal bar and the December lows are magnets below. Also, the January 10 buy setup was weak. The EURUSD will probably test those December lows next week.<p>By going below yesterday’s low, the EURUSD today triggered the bear flag sell signal. So far, the day is at its low and far below yesterday’s low. If today closes near its low, the EURUSD will probably continue down next week to those December lows, which are about 100 pips below.<p>The bears want a break below the November 29 low. That is the bottom of the 4 month trading range. If they get 2 closes below that low, they will then try for a break below the October low. That would be a new low in the 2 year bear trend and it would erase the possibility that the 4 month rally was the start of a bull trend on the weekly chart.<p>The EURUSD has been in a bear channel for almost 2 years, Traders have been buying below support and selling above resistance, expecting 2 – 3 week legs that are about 200 – 300 pips tall. Nothing has changed. There will be buyers around the December or October lows.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been selling off in a tight bear trend overnight. However, it lost momentum 2 hours ago. The bars have become smaller and the EURUSD has spent a couple hours in a tight trading range. That reduces the chance of it falling much lower today.<p>The bears will switch from selling at the market to selling rallies. Additionally, they will begin to take some profits around the low of the day. This loss of momentum reduces the chance of the trend continuing much lower today.<p>Also, the bulls will begin to look for reversals up for 10 pip scalps. But they will need bigger bounces before they have a reasonable chance of a bull trend reversal.<p>At the moment, a bull trend reversal is unlikely. Today’s bear channel will probably evolve into a 20 – 30 pip tall trading range for the remainder of the day before it falls much further.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-star-doji-candlestick-pattern-in-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini star doji candlestick pattern in buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini gapped to a new all-time high again today. It then entered a tight trading range and closed near the open. Since it is a small doji in a buy climax, it is a sell signal bar for Tuesday (Monday is a holiday).<p>The bull trend on the daily chart is becoming unusually extreme. That increases the chance of profit-taking within a couple of weeks. Because the rally is so unusually strong, once there is profit-taking, the bulls might wait a couple weeks instead of a couple days before buying again.<p>Since strong bull trends do not typically quickly reverse into bear trends, the downside risk is not great at the moment. However, the extreme rally increases the chance of a deeper and more protracted pullback than what the Emini has had in 4 months. Even if the bears get a 2 week pullback, the odds continue to favor higher prices.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was in a weak bull channel, but it trended up strongly into the close. The bulls want follow-through buying over the next few days. The bull trend is extremely strong on the daily charts. Traders continue to expect this melt up to continue higher, even though it is climactic.<p>Yesterday’s late rally was a Bull Surprise. Surprises typically have follow-through. However, the rally was so strong that bulls will look to take some profit by the end of the 2nd hour today. That typically will result in at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. This is especially true in the last hour. There are no important weekly targets nearby. Therefore, the bulls will simply try to get the week to close near its high. However, the bears want a conspicuous tail on the top of this week’s candlestick on the weekly chart. They will try to get a selloff in the final hour.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 11 points in the Globex session and today will probably gap up. The open will likely be far above the EMA. When that is the case, many bulls are hesitant to buy, especially if the first few bars are not big bull bars closing near their highs.<p>Traders do not want to pay a price that is far above average for price action that is not far above average. Consequently, a big gap up usually results in an early trading range. The bears hope for a double top or wedge top and then a swing down.<p>The bulls want to buy closer to the EMA. Once the Emini goes sideways to down the to the EMA, they will look to buy a double bottom or a wedge bottom for a swing up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"2020-1-17.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull channel and the Buy The Close rally\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-below-Low-2-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-17-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to far below yesterday’s low. Yesterday was a Low 2 bear flag sell signal bar and the December lows are magnets below. Also, the January 10 buy setup was weak. The EURUSD will probably test those December lows next week.<p>By going below yesterday’s low, the EURUSD today triggered the bear flag sell signal. So far, the day is at its low and far below yesterday’s low. If today closes near its low, the EURUSD will probably continue down next week to those December lows, which are about 100 pips below.<p>The bears want a break below the November 29 low. That is the bottom of the 4 month trading range. If they get 2 closes below that low, they will then try for a break below the October low. That would be a new low in the 2 year bear trend and it would erase the possibility that the 4 month rally was the start of a bull trend on the weekly chart.<p>The EURUSD has been in a bear channel for almost 2 years, Traders have been buying below support and selling above resistance, expecting 2 – 3 week legs that are about 200 – 300 pips tall. Nothing has changed. There will be buyers around the December or October lows.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been selling off in a tight bear trend overnight. However, it lost momentum 2 hours ago. The bars have become smaller and the EURUSD has spent a couple hours in a tight trading range. That reduces the chance of it falling much lower today.<p>The bears will switch from selling at the market to selling rallies. Additionally, they will begin to take some profits around the low of the day. This loss of momentum reduces the chance of the trend continuing much lower today.<p>Also, the bulls will begin to look for reversals up for 10 pip scalps. But they will need bigger bounces before they have a reasonable chance of a bull trend reversal.<p>At the moment, a bull trend reversal is unlikely. Today’s bear channel will probably evolve into a 20 – 30 pip tall trading range for the remainder of the day before it falls much further.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-star-doji-candlestick-pattern-in-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini star doji candlestick pattern in buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini gapped to a new all-time high again today. It then entered a tight trading range and closed near the open. Since it is a small doji in a buy climax, it is a sell signal bar for Tuesday (Monday is a holiday).<p>The bull trend on the daily chart is becoming unusually extreme. That increases the chance of profit-taking within a couple of weeks. Because the rally is so unusually strong, once there is profit-taking, the bulls might wait a couple weeks instead of a couple days before buying again.<p>Since strong bull trends do not typically quickly reverse into bear trends, the downside risk is not great at the moment. However, the extreme rally increases the chance of a deeper and more protracted pullback than what the Emini has had in 4 months. Even if the bears get a 2 week pullback, the odds continue to favor higher prices.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

There is a 60% chance that 5% correction will start within a few weeks.<p>The 30 year<strong>bond futures</strong>market is oversold and will probably bounce over the next couple weeks.<p>While the<strong>EURUSD</strong>has had its strongest rally in 2 years, it is still in a bear trend. However, it also has been in a trading range for 6 months and traders are continuing to look for reversals every 2 – 3 weeks.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Monthly chart might bounce for 2 months</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/30-year-bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-weak-high-1-bull-flag-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-18.png\" alt=\"30 year bond futures monthly candlestick chart has weak high 1 bull flag after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures has been sideways for 3 months. Because the monthly chart had 4 consecutive bear bars, a bull bar in January is less important than it otherwise would be.<p>Last year rallied in a parabolic wedge buy climax on the monthly chart. Traders therefore expect at least a couple legs sideways to down before the bulls will be willing to buy aggressively again.<p>After 4 bear bars, most bulls will want at least a small 2nd leg down before buying. Consequently, even though January will probably be a High 1 buy signal bar, traders expect only a 1 – 2 bar bounce. There will probably be sellers above. The monthly bond chart should form a lower high and have at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down after a 1 – 2 month bounce.<h3>Transitioning into 10 – 20 year bear trend</h3><p>I have mentioned many times over the past several years that the bond market has a nested wedge top on the monthly chart. This will probably lead to a 10 – 20 year bear trend.<p>However, I have also said repeatedly that a top on the monthly chart can take several years to complete. While the bonds transition from a bull to a bear trend, there still can be new highs. But the new highs will probably be brief.<p>At some point, there will be a strong enough selloff to create a consensus that the bonds have entered a bear trend. The monthly chart is still in transition. But, there is a 60% chance that the bond market is in the early stage of a 10 – 20 year bear trend. This is true even if there are a couple more minor new highs over the next year or two.<h2><strong>EURUSD monthly Forex chart:</strong><br>Weak bear flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-low-2-bear-flag-at-bear-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-18-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has low 2 bear flag at bear trend line\"></a></figure><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-bear-flag-and-Low-2-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-18-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has wedge bear flag and Low 2 bear flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD monthly Forex chart has been in a bear trend for 2 years. However, the EURUSD has rallied for 4 months. This is the longest rally in the bear trend.<p>The bear channel has been tight since it began in June or September 2018. A tight bear channel typically has to transition into a trading range before it can reverse into a bull trend.<p>The 4 month rally broke above the top of the bear channel, which means the bear trend line. But the breakout has been small and the rally has lacked consecutive bull trend bars. It looks more like a bull leg in a trading range or in a bear channel than the start of a bull trend.<p>Sometimes a break above a bear channel only lasts a few bars and then the bear trend resumes. The result is a broader, flatter, weaker bear channel. Traders then conclude that the attempt to evolve into a bull trend has failed.<h3>Early bull trend or bull leg in broader bear channel?</h3><p>The monthly chart is currently in a transition phase. Traders need more information before they conclude that these 4 months are the start of a bull trend or simply a bull leg in a broader bear channel.<p>At the moment, the rally looks more like a bull leg in a bear channel than the start of a bull trend. However, there are still 2 weeks left to January. If the bulls are able to get the month to close on its high, January would be the 2nd consecutive bull candlestick on the monthly chart. That would be the 1st instance in 2 years and it would increase the chance that the bear trend has ended.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Extremely strong rally, but possibly too far and too fast</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-buy-climax-at-top-of-bull-trend-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-18-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart in buy climax at top of bull trend channel\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has rallied strongly for 5 months. There is no sign of a top. This month so far is at the high. This is an extremely strong bull trend. But traders are wondering if it is too strong.<p>This increases the chance of some profit-taking coming soon. But when a trend is strong like this, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 2 bar pullback. Consequently, the downside risk in terms of the duration of a selloff is small over the next few months.<p>However, there have been several 1 – 2 month pullbacks over the past 2 years where the Emini fell about 10%. Therefore, while a pullback might not last long, it could be relatively sharp. In fact, there will probably be at least one or two 5 – 10% pullbacks in 2020.<p>But currently, there is no credible top and traders are continuing their buying. Also, they will buy the 1st pullback on the monthly chart.<h3>The 2020 candlestick on the yearly chart will likely be neutral</h3><p>It is important to remember what I said in early January about the yearly chart. By a yearly chart, I mean a candlestick chart where each bar is one year.<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"I discussed it in a video (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/what-to-expect-2020-video-report/\" target=\"_blank\">I discussed it in a video</a>. If you go to the video, I begin to talk about it at 1 minute and 46 seconds.<p>I said that 2019 was a huge bull trend bar closing near its high. It was the biggest bull bar in a 10 year rally. When the biggest bull bar comes late in a bull trend, it typically attracts profit-taking. The next bar is usually not another big bull bar. More often, it is a neutral bar or even a bear bar.<p>A neutral bar is one that closes somewhere in the middle third. That means that the bar has a conspicuous tail on the top and on the bottom.<p>The tail on the top comes from a rally and then a selloff. Traders should therefore expect that there will be a selloff back to around the open of the year at some point this year. Also, if the selloff falls continues far below the open, there will probably be a bounce late in the year so that the year will close somewhere in the middle third of its range.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Emini 5% correction could begin in 3 weeks</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-18-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart in parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a bull breakout for 4 months. There have been 2 brief pullbacks, but most of the candlesticks have had a big bull body and a close near the high of the bar.<p>There is no sign of a top. The bears typically will need at least a micro double top or consecutive buy climaxes before they can get more than a 2 week selloff. Since both patterns require at least a few bars, the downside risk over the couple weeks is small.<h3>Why a pullback should begin in about 3 weeks</h3><p>Everyone knows that the rally is unusually strong and it has lasted a long time. Traders are looking for a reason to take profits. The weekly chart is giving them one.<p>The past 2 weeks formed the strongest breakout in the 4 month bull trend. It is providing the bulls with a great price for profit taking. Many bulls will probably soon take advantage of this opportunity because they will be afraid that it might be brief.<p>The 2 most recent bars have surprisingly big bodies and closes near their highs. When there is a Surprise Breakout late in a bull trend, there is a 60% chance that it is the end of the current rally or that the rally will have one more final leg up. More often than not, there is a 1 – 3 bar (week) pause or pullback from the 2 bull bars and then a 1 – 2 bar final rally.<p>That 2nd leg up typically exhausts the bulls. The exhausted bulls take profits and the aggressive bears short. The result is usually at least a 10 bar pullback that has at least 2 small legs.<h3>What to expect over the next month</h3><p>The Emini will probably pause for a week or two, have one more 1 – 2 week surge, pull back for a month or two, and then resume up to at least the old high.<p>At that point, the picture gets confused. Confusion typically results in a trading range. The bulls want the bull trend to continue indefinitely and the bears might will try to create a double top and a major trend reversal. They will probably alternate control over several months before one side wins.<p>From what I wrote above about the yearly chart, traders should also assume that the Emini is creating most of the year’s gains in the 1st quarter. A buy climax usually leads to a lot of trading range trading. Traders should expect many months of sideways trading this year.<h3>Why should traders expect the pullback to fall about 5%?</h3><p>A common target for a pullback after a buy climax is the bottom of the most recent leg in the bull trend. That is last week’s low of 3213.25, which means about a 5% correction. It could be more and it could last longer, but that is a reasonable objective.<p>It is important to note that the Emini is above the top of the daily, weekly, and monthly bull channels. Traders typically take profits above bull channels. That is another reason to suspect that this rally will soon stall.<p>Obviously, if the Emini continues up without a pause, it could go a lot higher. However, this setup is similar to the pattern of January 2018. That is why in mid-January 2018 I wrote that traders should expect at least a 5% correction beginning within a couple weeks. The Emini fell 10% over the next month.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Breaking above top of bull channel so possible blow-off top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-in-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-buy-climaxes-at-top-of-bull-trend-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-18-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart in consecutive parabolic wedge buy climaxes at top of bull trend channel\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for 4 months. The bull channel is tight and every pullback has lasted only 1 – 3 bars (days).<p>The bull trend accelerated over the past week. The rally is breaking above the top of the tight bull channel.<p>Can this breakout be the start of an even stronger bull trend? That happens only 25% of the time. More likely, it will be an exhaustive move. That is also called a blow-off top.<p>Until there is a reversal, the odds continue to favor higher prices. However, there is a 75% chance that a bull breakout above a bull channel will begin to reverse back down within about 5 bars.<p>This week’s star doji could be the start of the pullback. A gap down next week would create an island top with Friday’s gap up. But remember, most island tops lead to pullbacks and not bear trends.<h3>1st selloff will probably be brief</h3><p>If next week pulls back, it will create that 1 – 2 week pause on the weekly chart that I discussed above. The weekly chart will then probably have one final 1 – 2 week push up before a 5% correction begins.<p>A reasonable target for a pullback next week is the middle or bottom of the tight bull channel. That is around the bull trend line. The bull trend line is around the 20 day EMA, which was support in early December and again in late December. There will probably be some support there again this time. Remember, there will probably be one more 1 – 2 week rally after a 1 – 2 week pullback.<p>While the odds of a pullback are growing, this is a very strong bull trend. There is no sign of a major top. Traders should assume that the market will be higher a few months from now. A 5% correction is a minor reversal and not be the end of the bull trend. But it might be the start of a trading range.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But Friday was a small day and the buy climax has been extreme. That increases the chance of a week or two of profit-taking soon. I mentioned over the weekend that there is a 60% chance of a 5% pullback beginning within a few weeks.<p>For example, a gap down this week would create an island top. Island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns, especially in strong trends. However, they sometimes come at major turning points. Because the bull trend on the weekly and monthly charts is strong, the best the bears can probably get is a 1 – 2 week pullback from this island top.<p>Can the bull trend continue through the end of January? Yes, but because it is so unusually extreme, the odds of a 1 – 2 week pullback are going up.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 11 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap down. That will create a one day island top on the daily chart. The bulls will try to close the gap to erase the island top. The daily chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for 4 months. Every pullback has lasted only 1 – 3 days. The bulls want this to continue.<p>However, at some point the bulls will take profits. That will lead to a 1 – 2 week pullback. The bears want to keep the gap open. Furthermore, they want today to be a big bear trend day. If they succeed, that will increase the number of bulls taking profits this week. That could lead to a 1 – 2 week selloff.<p>As I mentioned over the weekend, this week was likely to be a smaller bar on the weekly chart. After that, there will probably be one more brief push up on the weekly chart before a 5% correction. But there is a 40% chance that a strong bear day today could begin that correction.<p>Because today can influence the appearance of the next couple of weeks, there is an increased chance of a bear trend. Can today be an outside up bull trend? Yes, but that is unlikely after the 2 big bull bars on the weekly chart. Traders are more likely to take some profits this week.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-star-doji-candlestick-pattern-in-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-21.png\" alt=\"Emini star doji candlestick pattern in buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

This triggered a double bottom buy signal with the December 20 low.<p>When it turned down last week, it formed the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top. When there is both a top and a bottom, a chart is in a trading range. That means it is in Breakout Mode. Traders know that the probability of a bull breakout of the range is about the same as for a bear breakout.<p>The EURUSD has been in a trading range for 6 months. Traders are deciding if the 2 year bear trend has ended. The bulls need breaks above major lower highs to convince traders that the bear channel on the weekly chart has converted into either a trading range or a bull trend. The bears want the 20 month series of lower highs and lows to continue.<p>While in a trading range, buy and sell signals typically are not strong. Also, the legs up and down reverse every few weeks. The current selloff has lasted about 3 weeks to the bears are taking profits and the bulls are starting to buy.<p>Will this be the start of a bull trend? Probably not. Just look to the left. There have been many strong rallies and selloffs. Each one has failed. There is no reason to believe that this one will be different. Traders will continue to look for reversals and quick profits until there is a strong break above or below the 6 month range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied 35 pips overnight. Forex day traders have only been buying for the past 4 hours.<p>But the day’s range now is about the size of recent average days. Unless the bars on the 5 minute chart start to become bigger, day traders will assume that the overnight bull trend will soon convert into a trading range.<p>Once they see a 20 pip pullback, they will begin to sell rallies for scalps. Until then, they will continue to look to buy 10 pip pullbacks. However, they will probably scalp out of their longs since they are disappointed by the rally being so small.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-triangle-open-then-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle open then bull trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But Friday was a small day and the buy climax has been extreme. That increases the chance of a week or two of profit-taking soon. I mentioned over the weekend that there is a 60% chance of a 5% pullback beginning within a few weeks.<p>For example, a gap down this week would create an island top. Island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns, especially in strong trends. However, they sometimes come at major turning points. Because the bull trend on the weekly and monthly charts is strong, the best the bears can probably get is a 1 – 2 week pullback from this island top.<p>Can the bull trend continue through the end of January? Yes, but because it is so unusually extreme, the odds of a 1 – 2 week pullback are going up.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 11 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap down. That will create a one day island top on the daily chart. The bulls will try to close the gap to erase the island top. The daily chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for 4 months. Every pullback has lasted only 1 – 3 days. The bulls want this to continue.<p>However, at some point the bulls will take profits. That will lead to a 1 – 2 week pullback. The bears want to keep the gap open. Furthermore, they want today to be a big bear trend day. If they succeed, that will increase the number of bulls taking profits this week. That could lead to a 1 – 2 week selloff.<p>As I mentioned over the weekend, this week was likely to be a smaller bar on the weekly chart. After that, there will probably be one more brief push up on the weekly chart before a 5% correction. But there is a 40% chance that a strong bear day today could begin that correction.<p>Because today can influence the appearance of the next couple of weeks, there is an increased chance of a bear trend. Can today be an outside up bull trend? Yes, but that is unlikely after the 2 big bull bars on the weekly chart. Traders are more likely to take some profits this week.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-star-doji-candlestick-pattern-in-buy-climax.png\"><img src=\"2020-1-21.png\" alt=\"Emini star doji candlestick pattern in buy climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

This triggered a double bottom buy signal with the December 20 low.<p>When it turned down last week, it formed the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top. When there is both a top and a bottom, a chart is in a trading range. That means it is in Breakout Mode. Traders know that the probability of a bull breakout of the range is about the same as for a bear breakout.<p>The EURUSD has been in a trading range for 6 months. Traders are deciding if the 2 year bear trend has ended. The bulls need breaks above major lower highs to convince traders that the bear channel on the weekly chart has converted into either a trading range or a bull trend.

That is because the past 2 weeks were big bull bars. A 3rd one late in a bull trend would be very unusual.<p>Yesterday tried to become an outside up day on the daily chart, but failed to get above Friday’s high. It was the 3rd small sideways day.<p>There is now a micro double top on the daily chart. Yesterday is therefore a sell signal bar on the daily chart in a 4 month buy climax. But with a bull body and 2 big weeks up, this is a weak sell setup.<p>I also wrote over the weekend that this week will probably not be strongly bearish. It will probably be a pause after 2 big bull weeks on the weekly chart. A pause bar is could be a doji or a small bull bar.<p>It is important to remember that the weekly chart has consecutive big bull bars coming late in a bull trend. There is therefore a 60% chance of a 5% pullback beginning within a few weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 12 points in the Globex session. It might therefore have a small gap up to a new all-time high today. However, the past 2 days on the daily chart have been dojis. Also, this week will probably not be a big bull bar on the weekly chart. Therefore there is less of a chance of a big bull trend day today. Also, small gaps typically close early in the day.<p>Because the daily and weekly charts are unusually extremely overbought, traders expect profit taking soon. That means there will probably be one or more big bear days coming within a few weeks.<p>For example, if today gaps above yesterday’s high and then sells off to below yesterday’s low, today would be an outside down day. That would increase the chance of lower prices tomorrow. It would also increase the chance of a bear bar on the weekly chart.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-triangle-open-then-bull-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-22.png\" alt=\"Emini triangle open then bull trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is always going to be a reasonable buy setup and a reasonable sell setup in a trading range. The bears currently have a head and shoulders top while the bulls have a double bottom. They bulls now also have a 3 day micro double bottom.<p>Since trading ranges resist breaking out, these trend setups usually fail. At some point, there will be a successful breakout, but every breakout attempt up and down for the past 20 months has failed. Consequently, traders continue to look for reversals every few weeks.<p>After the current 3 week selloff, traders expect a 2 – 3 week rally soon. They are deciding if the current bottom attempt will be the start of the rally.<p>However, reversals usually come after breaking above some obvious support or resistance. The December 20 low is an example. Because this selloff has not quite reached that magnet, traders are hesitant to buy.<h3>Has the 3 week bear leg ended?</h3><p>The price action is not strongly bullish. The buy signal bar on Monday was a small bull doji. Today so far is another small bull bar. This does not represent strong rejection of the current price. Many traders want to see a stronger reversal up, and one that preferably comes from below more major support.<p>However, if there is a Bull Surprise bar this week, they will conclude that a 2 – 3 week rally has begun. In the meantime, the buying is weak.<p>But so is the selling. Traders expect reversals every few weeks. This selloff has lasted more than 3 weeks. When a market is in a trading range, traders want to buy low and sell high. The EURUSD is now low. Traders prefer to buy here and not sell. The bears want to sell rallies and not at the low. This is resulting in the lack of big bear bars down here.<p>Because the odds favor a reversal up soon, traders are looking for a strong buy signal bar or a big bull bar. Alternatively, they want a strong break below the December lows. That would then lead to at least a couple small legs down to the November 29 low or the October low. In the meantime, they are mostly day trading for small profits.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 20 pip range overnight. It sold off to below Monday’s low by 1 pip and reversed up. There is now a micro double bottom on the daily chart with that low.<p>The bulls want today to close on its high and have a big bull body on the daily chart. Today would then be a reasonable buy signal bar on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of a rally over the next week or two.<p>The bears want a break below the December lows. They therefore want today to break again below Monday’s low and for today to close far below that low.<p>With the range being only 20 pips so far, there is no strong sense that the price is wrong. Day traders are looking for 10 pip scalps from small reversals. Because of the possibility of a 2 week rally or a break below the December lows, day traders will switch to swing trading if there is a strong breakout up or down. But at the moment, that is not likely to happen today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-spike-and-channel-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

In the meantime, the buying is weak.<p>But so is the selling. Traders expect reversals every few weeks. This selloff has lasted more than 3 weeks. When a market is in a trading range, traders want to buy low and sell high. The EURUSD is now low. Traders prefer to buy here and not sell. The bears want to sell rallies and not at the low. This is resulting in the lack of big bear bars down here.<p>Because the odds favor a reversal up soon, traders are looking for a strong buy signal bar or a big bull bar. Alternatively, they want a strong break below the December lows. That would then lead to at least a couple small legs down to the November 29 low or the October low. In the meantime, they are mostly day trading for small profits.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 20 pip range overnight. It sold off to below Monday’s low by 1 pip and reversed up. There is now a micro double bottom on the daily chart with that low.<p>The bulls want today to close on its high and have a big bull body on the daily chart. Today would then be a reasonable buy signal bar on the daily chart. That would increase the chance of a rally over the next week or two.<p>The bears want a break below the December lows. They therefore want today to break again below Monday’s low and for today to close far below that low.<p>With the range being only 20 pips so far, there is no strong sense that the price is wrong. Day traders are looking for 10 pip scalps from small reversals. Because of the possibility of a 2 week rally or a break below the December lows, day traders will switch to swing trading if there is a strong breakout up or down. But at the moment, that is not likely to happen today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-spike-and-channel-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Yesterday is a sell signal bar for today. It formed a Low 2 top with Friday.<p>As I wrote over the weekend, traders should expect a 5% correction to begin within a few weeks. This is a good location for bulls who are trading the daily and weekly charts to take some profits.<p>Was yesterday the start of the correction? It is too early to tell. But there is an increased risk of one or more big bear days coming soon. Once traders see them, many will take profits and more bears will sell, expecting a 2 – 3 week pullback.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 2 points in the Globex session. Because of the buy climax on the daily and weekly charts and the sell signal bar yesterday, there is an increased risk of a bear trend day today.<p>However, I wrote over the weekend that this week would most likely form a pause bar on the weekly chart. That means a smaller bar that might close near the open.<p>Today is probably going to open near the open of the week. That could be a magnet for the remainder of the week. If so, both today and tomorrow would then probably oscillate around it. There is an increased chance of trading range price action through tomorrow’s close. Also, the week will probably close either a little bit above or below its open and form a small doji bar on the weekly chart.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-spike-and-channel-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-23.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bear trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Consequently, traders look for reversals every few weeks.<p>Yesterday was a buy signal bar for a micro double bottom with Friday’s low and a double bottom with the December 20 low. However, it was a small bar. There is not a violent rejection of the current price for being too low. Also, there are other magnets just below. While traders have been looking for reversals every few weeks, they are not convinced that this 4 week selloff has adequately tested the nearby support of the December 6 low.<p>Today so far went 1 pip above yesterday’s high. That triggered the buy signal on the daily chart. But instead of racing up, the EURUSD pulled back.<p>This is not how a strong buy signal typically behaves. There were as many sellers as buyers above the buy signal bar. Traders are still waiting for more information before concluding that the 4 week selloff has ended or if it will continue down to the December 6 low or November low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has had 4 small sideways days. Traders have been buying below the low of the prior day and selling above the prior day’s high. They need more information before swing trading again. Day traders want to see a 30 – 50 pip strong rally or selloff.

However, after an early selloff, it reversed up. It was a 1 day pullback in a bull trend and it is therefore a buy signal bar for today.<p>After 2 big bull bars on the weekly chart late in a bull trend, this week was likely to be a pause bar. On the weekend, I said that the week might have a small range or close near the open and form a doji bar on the weekly chart. Since the Emini is near the week’s open, the open might be a magnet all day today, especially in the last hour. That increases the chance of more trading range trading today, despite yesterday’s strong reversal up.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 6 points in the Globex session. It might gap above yesterday’s high, which would trigger the High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart.<p>The bulls want a weekly close at a new all-time high. But even if they get it, this week will still have a small range. That would qualify as a pause bar on the weekly chart, which was likely this week. However, a bull body would increase the chance of a bigger week up next week.<p>Yesterday was a buy signal in a strong bull trend and the signal will probably trigger today. That increases the chance of a bull trend day today. But the past 4 days had relatively small ranges. In addition, each had at least one swing up and down. Finally, they were sideways and today is now at the top of this range. These factors make a big bull trend day unlikely today.<p>Can today be a big bear day. Probably not. Yesterday was the entry bar for a sell signal on the daily chart. Because it was a strong bull day, the bears will probably not be able to regain control today. Day traders expect today to be sideways to up, but not strongly up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-sell-climax-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-24.png\" alt=\"Emini sell climax and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-breakout-below-neck-line-of-head-and-shoulders-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-24-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex breakout below neck line of head and shoulders top\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke below the neck line of the 2 month had and shoulders top yesterday. I said that many bulls would not buy until the selloff reversed up from below the support of the December 6 of November 29 lows. It broke below the December 6 low yesterday.<p>The November 29 low is just below the 1.10 Big Round Number, which has been important for 6 months. The EURUSD will probably get there within a week or two.<p>While yesterday’s bear breakout was not particularly big, it was enough to make traders expect at least slightly lower prices. January traded above December’s high and it is now near December’s low. With a week left in January, January might trade below December and become an outside down month.<p>That would be a sign of strong bears, but it is less important when if comes in a tight trading range. The month chart has been in a tight range for 6 months.<p>I have not talked about the measured move targets and the gap on the daily chart around 1.08, but they are now coming back into consideration. There is currently a 50% chance that the 2 year bear trend will get there before the bulls will get their reversal up.<h3>Weak breakout below neck line of head and shoulders top</h3><p>Today also broke below the December 6 low but bounced back up to that low over the last hour. It will probably be an important price today.<p>When the bears get a breakout, they have a higher probability of lower prices is they get a close below the breakout point. The chance of lower prices goes up if the close is far below the breakout point and if there are consecutive closes below the breakout point.<p>So far, this breakout lacks strength. That means that the month-long selloff still looks like a leg in a trading range or bear channel, just like all of the other legs up and down for the past 20 months.<p>Traders are not expecting an acceleration down from here into a strong bear trend. Instead, they are looking for a reversal.<p>There have been problems with each of the bottom attempts over the past 3 weeks. Until there is a strong buy signal bar or strong reversal up, traders will bet that the EURUSD will continue to drift lower. The next support is the 1.10 Big Round Number and the November 29 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off 35 pips overnight and broke below yesterday’s low. Since yesterday had a prominent tail below and closed above the December 6 low, it was not a strong breakout. However, its body was big enough to be a surprise. A Bear Surprise Bar typically will have at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>The EURUSD has been in a 15 pip range for the past 4 hours. Day traders are looking for scalps. The bears want a close far below the December 6 low and the bulls want a strong reversal up. The lack of energy make both unlikely today. Instead, today will probably Oscillate around that low and then close a little above or below it.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-outside-down-sell-climax-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down sell climax day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today is therefore a big outside down day. It is a sell signal bar for next week. However, there is a 40% chance of a bull buy signal bar on Monday.<p>The weekly chart closed near its low and last week is a sell signal bar for this week.

This might be the start of a 5% correction, but there could be one more brief new high first.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are reversing up but the rally will probably form a lower high.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is trying to resume its 2 year bear trend, but there will be buyers below the November and October lows.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Bounce after 4 month pullback</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/US-Treasury-bond-futures-weak-bull-flag-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-25.png\" alt=\"US Treasury bond futures weak bull flag after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures is reversing up in January after 4 consecutive bear bars on the monthly chart. Four is unusual when there has been a strong bull trend. I wrote last month that January would probably be a bull month. With only 5 trading days left in January, the month will probably be a bull bar closing near its high.<p>Since the selloff is also a pullback in a bull trend, January is a High 1 buy signal bar. However, after 4 consecutive bear bars, there will probably be sellers not too far above.<p>This is especially true since 2019 formed a parabolic wedge buy climax. That typically leads to 2 legs sideways to down. The 4 bear bars formed the 1st leg. Traders will look for a lower high over the next few months and then a 2nd leg sideways to down.<h3>What is the current trend?</h3><p>I have written many times over the past few years that the 30 year bull trend is ending. Traders should expect a decade or two of lower prices and higher interest rates.<p>I keep saying that a 30 year rally could take years of sideways trading before reversing into a bear trend. This transition has been going on for 4 years and there is no clear reversal down yet. There might be one or more new highs before the bear trend becomes clear.<p>It is important to understand that<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Americans will not accept zero interest rates (opens in a new tab)\">Americans will not accept zero interest rates</a>. That will keep a cap on bond prices while the transition into a bear trend continues.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Bear leg in 6 month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-weekly-Forex-chart-has-wedge-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-25-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD weekly Forex chart has wedge bear flag\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart formed a bear inside bar last week. It closed on its low and it followed 3 consecutive bear bars. This was a credible Low 1 sell setup. When this week traded below last week’s low, it triggered the sell signal. The bears are hoping that the 2 year bear trend is resuming after a 3 month rally to the top of the bear channel.<p>However, the EURUSD is also in the middle of a 6 month trading range. Traders have been looking for reversals every few weeks. Since this is the 4th week down, there are fewer bears willing to sell. Instead, they would rather begin to look to take profits and sell again after a 2 – 3 week bounce.<h3>EURUSD monthly Forex chart: Low 1 bear flag</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-monthly-Forex-chart-has-4-month-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-25-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD monthly Forex chart has 4 month bear flag\"></a></figure><p>The January candlestick on the monthly chart closes in 5 trading days. So far, January is a big bear bar closing near its low. It traded above the December high and is now near the December low. If it falls below the December low next week, January would be an outside down candlestick on the monthly chart in a 2 year bear trend. That would increase the chance of lower prices.<p>I have not mentioned the 2 measured move targets and the gap around 1.08 on the daily chart recently (not shown). However, both are magnets below. An outside down month would increase the chance of the trend continuing down to that area.<p>While this is true, the past 6 months have been sideways. They therefore have formed a tight trading range. That is a bad environment for stop entry traders.<p>January is therefore a weak sell setup, even thought the monthly chart has been trending down for 2 years. There may be more buyers than sellers below the January low.<p>Traders have been buying every new low for 20 months. Therefore, there probably will be buyers below the October low, which is the bottom of the bear trend, and around the 1.08 magnets. The odds favor more sideways to down trading until the bulls get a strong upside breakout.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong bull trend, but minor profit-taking soon</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-small-bull-body.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-25-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart has small bull body\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;is forming its 5th consecutive bull trend bar. While this means that the bull trend is very strong, it is also becoming extreme. The tail on top of the January candlestick is a sign of a loss of momentum soon.<p>There are 5 trading days left in January. If Friday’s selling continues next week, January could have a bear body when it closes next Friday. If so, it would be a sell signal bar for February.<p>However, after 4 strong bull bars, the 1st reversal down will probably be minor. That means it would probably only last a bar or two. But on the monthly chart, that means 2 months, and it could be well over 100 points.<p>The bears typically need at least a micro double top to get more than a 1 – 2 bar pullback when a bull trend is strong. Traders expect the downside risk over the next several months to be small.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Emini profit taking and 5% pullback after January buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-parabolic-wedge-top-at-leg-1-equals-2-measured-move-target.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-25-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart has parabolic wedge top at leg 1 equals 2 measured move target\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed a bear bar this week after 2 big bull bars closing near their highs. I mentioned last week that a pause was likely this week. Those 2 bull bars formed the strongest breakout in the 4 month bull trend. That typically attracts profit-taking, but there is often one more brief leg up before it begins. Traders are likely begin to take some profits soon. They might have begun on Friday.<p>There is a parabolic wedge rally to a Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured move. Traders see this is a logical area for some profit-taking.<p>It is important to note that many computers see the 2nd leg up as beginning with the October 3 low instead of the June low. Their Leg 1 = Leg 2 target is near 3500 (not shown). The bulls have a good chance of reaching it later this year.<p>Last week’s bear body is a sell signal bar. Because of the prominent tail below and the tight bull channel, this is not a strong sell setup. Furthermore, there is still a 40% chance of one more brief new high before the 5% correction begins. But traders should expect at least a couple weeks of profit-taking soon.<p>Those 2 big bull bars late in a bull trend are similar to the pair of bars in early January 2018. At the time, I said that there would probably be a 5% correction beginning in a few weeks, but there might be one more brief push up 1st. As you can see, the bulls got that brief final push up and then the Emini sold off 10% over the next month.<p>The chart pattern and the context (late in a buy climax) are the same this time. Traders should expect something similar.<h3>Where is support?</h3><p>The 1st target after a reversal down from a buy climax is the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the low of the 2 bull bars, which would be a test of around 3,200 and last year’s close. That is close enough to a 5% correction to make many bulls wait for the selloff to reach 5% before buying again.<h3>The size of a pullback matters</h3><p>Traders pay attention to the size of pullbacks. Certain numbers are support. For example, there were several pullbacks over the past 2 years that were almost exactly 10% or 20%. That tells you that traders were looking to buy a 10% or 20% pullback.<p>Other common pullbacks are 2% and 5%. Since this bull trend has lasted so long, the pullback will probably last at least a couple weeks and test the low from 3 weeks ago. Therefore, 5% might be the number where the bulls will look to buy again.<h3>Buy climax and now a possible top</h3><p>Bull trends and buy climaxes can last a long time, but not forever. This buy climax has lasted 4 months, which is unusually long. It increases the chance of profit-taking and a pullback soon, and it might now be underway.<p>It is important to understand that there is no reversal down yet on the weekly chart. The bears currently only have a weak sell signal bar.<p>Also, markets have inertia. That means they resist change. When there is a strong bull trend, most attempts to reverse will form a bull flag or a trading range, not bear trend.<p>Additionally, even if the bears get a 5% pullback, traders will buy it. Strong bull trends usually do not instantly reverse into bear trends. There typically will be a transition into a trading range first. Consequently, the downside risk over the next couple months is not great.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Small Pullback Bull Trend, but profit-taking soon</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-outside-down-bar-at-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-25-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart outside down bar at top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull trend for 4 months. Traders have bought every 1 – 3 day pullback for 4 months.<p>The bears now have a big outside down bar on Friday. But it has a prominent tail below and so far, the pullback has lasted only 2 days. There is still a 40% chance that the bulls will buy it next week. If so, their buying could lead to another high before there is a 5% pullback.<p>Monday and Tuesday are important. If either is a big bear day, the odds will favor a 5% pullback within a couple weeks. On the other hand, if either is a bull bar closing near its high, traders will begin to think that Friday was a bear trap. Many traders would buy above the bull bar and bet that the Small Pullback Bull Trend is still intact.<h3>3,300 is resistance</h3><p>In early January, the bulls tried for several days to break above 3,300. I discussed this at the time in the chat room. I said that it meant that traders saw 3,300 as an important price.<p>The Emini gapped above it on January 16, but there was no follow-through buying. Traders were wondering if the breakout would hold. The bulls tried to reverse up from it on Thursday, but the bears broke strongly below it on Friday. It is now short-term resistance.<p>Why 3,300? I don’t care. All that matters is that traders see it as an important price. It therefore might be important for the next several months.<p>What does that mean? Well, if the Emini sells off strongly from here, traders will expect it to get back to 3,300 within a few months. Alternatively, if the bulls rally far above it over the next few weeks, there will probably be a pullback down to it within a couple months. It looks like traders care about it.<h3>Emini reversing down from top of bull channel</h3><p>Since the Emini was at the top of the bull channel on the daily chart, traders expected a sideways to down move. Friday’s selloff already reached the minimum targets, which are the middle of the channel and the EMA.<p>Because the channel is so tight, the bottom of the channel is not far below. The Emini will probably reach it within a couple weeks by going sideways or down.<p>Normally, traders would expect buyers there. But because the chart is so climactic, there is an increased chance of a break below the bottom of the channel.<p>The next support is the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is the January 6 low, just above 3200. A test of that area would be about a 5% correction and a test of the 2019 close.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Remember, 2 weeks ago, I said that t 5% correction was likely to begin within 3 weeks. It probably began last week. Friday is a sell signal bar for today.<p>The Emini is down almost 50 points in the Globex session and almost 3% from the high. It is now close enough to make the bears take some profits.<p>If today has a big gap down and then a reversal up, the correction could end today. It would be near the 1st targets of the daily EMA and the January 6 buy climax low. Many bears would take at least some profits. If enough did, the bull trend could resume.<h3>A Surprise Bear Breakout usually has a 2nd leg down</h3><p>At the moment, the selloff is a Surprise Bear Breakout. When there is a Bear Surprise, there usually is at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. Consequently, even if the bulls get a strong reversal up today or tomorrow, there will probably be more traders looking to sell for a 2nd leg down than looking to buy for a resumption of the bull trend.<h3>Getting near minimum targets for bears</h3><p>Last week is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart. The 2 prior weeks were the biggest 2 bull bars late in a bull trend. That typically makes bulls take some profits. Today will probably gap down, which would trigger the weekly sell signal. The Emini would be about 3% down. That is getting close to my minimum target of 5% .<p>This is an important week. If the bears begin to get consecutive bear bars on the daily chart, especially big bear bars, traders will conclude that the profit-taking will probably reach about 5% and below 3200.<p>The big ranges over the past 2 days increase the chance of more big ranges this week. Furthermore, big bear days are more likely than big bull days. But because the chart is now oversold, the bears will begin to take some profits today. There will probably be at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading at some point.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 49 points in the Globex session. It will probably gap down on both the daily and weekly charts. This is a surprisingly big 2 day selloff. I and many traders will look to take some profits on their shorts today.<p>Also, Friday was a sell climax day. That is another reason for some profit taking. There is a 75% chance of at least 2 hours of sideways to up trading today beginning by the end of the 2nd hour today. It reduces the chance of today being another relentless bear trend day.<p>This is the last week of January. I mentioned a couple weeks ago that the month might end near its 3246.50 open. That might be a magnet this week. That means that the Emini might trade around it this week and then close the month on Friday close to it.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-outside-down-sell-climax-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-27.png\" alt=\"Emini outside down sell climax day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-top-and-parabolic-wedge-bottoms.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-27-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex head and shoulders top and parabolic wedge bottoms\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a trading range for 6 months. Trading ranges resist breaking out into trends. Traders believe that the 5 week selloff is a bear leg in the trading range rather than the start of a bear trend. But they want a strong buy signal bar before taking profits on shorts and looking to buy.<p>The EURUSD is now is the support zone that I have discussed for a few weeks. I said that reversals in trading ranges usually come from beyond support and resistance. That is why I said that the selloff would probably fall below the December 20 low. Even if it falls below the November 29 low or the October low, traders will look to buy a reversal up. They will bet that a reversal is more likely than a successful breakout.<p>If today is a strong bull day, it would be a buy signal bar for tomorrow. Many bears would take profits and the bulls would begin to buy. They would see a higher low above the November low and consecutive small parabolic wedge bottoms.<p>The minimum target would be the to of the most recent small wedge channel, which is the high from 5 days ago. The next target would be the January 16 lower high. That is around a 50% retracement.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market fell below last week’s low overnight, but reversed up. There is still room to the 1.10 Big Round Number and many bulls would like to see the selloff get there and then reverse up. Consequently, that magnet below reduces the chance of a big bull day today. However, because there will probably be a 100 – 200 pip rally beginning within a week, traders are ready for a bull trend day soon.<br>they might need 2 – 3 sideways days and 2 – 3 bull bodies before they buy aggressively.<p>Because the EURUSD is in the buy zone on the daily chart and the current bear leg has lasted longer than most, the bears will look to take profits soon. This reduces the chance of a big bear day early this week.<p>The overnight range has been small. Day traders have been scalping. However, there is an increased chance of one or more bull days this week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-major-surprise-then-bear-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull major surprise then bear trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That created a windfall profits for the bears. Also, the selloff was just a little more than the psychological 100 points down from the high. Finally, it was a test of the open of the month. Many bought back their shorts. The Emini entered a trading range for a couple hours. There was a brief 2nd leg up to another trading range, but the Emini drifted back down for the 2nd half of the day.<p>Today was a bull trending trading range day, but it was mostly sideways. The bulls see today as a buy signal bar for tomorrow. Since it had a small body, it is a weak buy setup.<p>It is important to understand that a short covering rally often lasts a couple days. The odds still favor a 2nd leg down to below the January 6 low of 3213.25 and the 3200 Big Round Number. That would also be a test of the 5% pullback level, which is 3171.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Because that made the Emini oversold, many bears took profits and aggressive bulls bought. After a rally on the open, the Emini went sideways for the rest of the day. Yesterday is a weak buy signal bar for today.<p>Most traders expect more of a pullback from the all-time high. The minimum target is the January 6 low of 3213.25. That is the start of the final leg up on the daily chart. Traders see that as the first target once profit-taking begins.<p>The 3200 Big Round Number is just below that. A 5% pullback is a psychological support area and it is 3171. Many bulls like to buy 5 or 10% pullbacks. That is another reason to expect lower prices.<p>Profit-taking (a short covering rally) in a bear breakout typically lasts a couple days. Consequently, there might be follow-through buying today. However, the selloff was surprisingly strong. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg down. The magnets below make a 2nd leg down likely.<p>Traders see 3300 as an important price. It was resistance until January 15 and support until January 23. Consequently, it might get tested before the 2nd leg down begins.<h3>Importance of the January open</h3><p>There is one final important point. I wrote last week that this is the last week of the month. I said that the Emini might oscillate around the open of the month all week. Then, on Friday, decide whether January will have a bull or bear body on the monthly chart.<p>Yesterday spent a lot of time around the January open. It will be a magnet all week. If the bears get a close below the open of the month, January will be a strong sell signal bar. However, after 4 strong months up, any selloff will probably only last a bar or two (a month or two).<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a trading range day and today will open around yesterday’s high.

It broke below the neckline of a head and shoulders top and it is now testing the bottom of a 4 month trading range.<p>That range is within a 6 month range. Both are within a 2 year bear channel. Ever leg up and down for 2 years has reversed within a few weeks. Traders are confident that this one will reverse up for 200 or more pips at some point.<p>But they do not know from what level. Will it be from around 1.10 and the October/November double bottom, or from below the October low at the bottom of the 2 year bear trend? Or, less likely, with the EURUSD collapse to far below the October low?<p>While a reversal up for 2 – 3 weeks is likely to begin at any time, until there is a bottom, there is no bottom. Furthermore, January traded above the December high. It traded below the December low today by 1 pip. January is therefore an outside down candlestick on the monthly chart in a bear trend.<p>That is often a significant sign of strong bears. But the monthly chart has been in a tight trading range for 6 months. An outside bar is less important in this context.

Traders continue to expect a 2 – 3 week rally to begin within a couple weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded below the December low by 1 pip overnight. When a Forex market breaks below a major support level by 1 pip and then bounces, it is telling traders that the support might hold.<p>This increases the chance of a bounce up in February. The bulls did not give up and the bears did not sell aggressively. Instead, the bears bought back shorts and the bulls bought for a bounce. This is trading range behavior.<p>Additionally, the overnight range has been small. That increases the chance that the weak selloff will transition into a trading range day today.<p>Because the EURUSD is at major support, there is an increased chance of a big trend day up or down. But, there is no sign of one yet. Traders might be waiting for tomorrow’s FOMC announcement before deciding whether to begin a sharp move up or down from here.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-gap-closure.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and gap closure\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Because that made the Emini oversold, many bears took profits and aggressive bulls bought. After a rally on the open, the Emini went sideways for the rest of the day. Yesterday is a weak buy signal bar for today.<p>Most traders expect more of a pullback from the all-time high. The minimum target is the January 6 low of 3213.25. That is the start of the final leg up on the daily chart. Traders see that as the first target once profit-taking begins.<p>The 3200 Big Round Number is just below that. A 5% pullback is a psychological support area and it is 3171. Many bulls like to buy 5 or 10% pullbacks. That is another reason to expect lower prices.<p>Profit-taking (a short covering rally) in a bear breakout typically lasts a couple days. Consequently, there might be follow-through buying today. However, the selloff was surprisingly strong. Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg down. The magnets below make a 2nd leg down likely.<p>Traders see 3300 as an important price. It was resistance until January 15 and support until January 23. Consequently, it might get tested before the 2nd leg down begins.<h3>Importance of the January open</h3><p>There is one final important point. I wrote last week that this is the last week of the month. I said that the Emini might oscillate around the open of the month all week. Then, on Friday, decide whether January will have a bull or bear body on the monthly chart.<p>Yesterday spent a lot of time around the January open. It will be a magnet all week. If the bears get a close below the open of the month, January will be a strong sell signal bar. However, after 4 strong months up, any selloff will probably only last a bar or two (a month or two).<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a trading range day and today will open around yesterday’s high. The bears want a double top with yesterday’s high, a break below yesterday’s low, and then a measured move down and a break below 3200.<p>More likely, the bulls will get a sideways to up move for at least one more day. There might be a rally back up to 3300 this week before there is a 2nd leg down to below 3200.<p>Tomorrow’s FOMC announcement could be a catalyst for a sharp move up or down. However, unless there is a strong rally to above the all-time high, traders suspect that this selloff will not end until it has reached at least 5%.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-major-surprise-then-bear-trend-reversal-day.png\"><img src=\"2020-1-28.png\" alt=\"Emini bull major surprise then bear trend reversal day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The Emini was briefly oversold and many bears bought back their shorts. Yesterday is a buy signal bar for today.<p>However, the odds still favor a 2nd leg sideways to down to below 3200 within a couple weeks. Since 3300 was an important resistance level and then support level in January, this bounce is testing it. The odds still favor a 2nd leg sideways to down unless there is a strong break to a new high.<p>The month ends on Friday. I have been saying that the open of the month might be a magnet in the final hour on Friday, and that the Emini might oscillate around it until then. This is still the case. The bulls obviously want a 5th consecutive big bull bar on the monthly chart. But the bears want January to close on its low and become a strong sell signal bar. More likely, the Emini will close the month somewhere in the middle.<h3>FOMC announcement today</h3><p>There is an FOMC announcement today at 11 am PST. The Fed has led traders to believe that there would be no change in policy today. A surprise is unlikely. However, day traders should still be flat ahead of the report.<p>Also, they should wait for at least 10 minutes after the report before resuming trading. This is because there is usually a big move up and down within the 1st few minutes after the announcement. It usually takes at least 10 minutes before a trend will begin.<p>Even if the bulls get a rally up to the January high, the Emini will probably be sideways to down for at least a couple weeks. The upside is therefore limited.<p>But because the bull trend is so strong on the weekly and monthly chart, the downside is probably limited as well. With limited up and down, traders should expect that the 4 month buy climax will evolve into a trading range for at least a couple weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 7 points in the Globex session. It might gap above yesterday’s high. That would create a 2 day island bottom with Monday’s gap down. However, island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns. A gap up today is therefore not a major buy signal today.<p>I have been saying that the Emini might have to test 3300 before the bears can get a 2nd leg down. This rally is that test.<p>The Emini will probably not break strongly above or reverse strongly down ahead of today’s FOMC report. Also, while yesterday was a big bull day, it was mostly sideways for the final 4 hours. Day traders are expecting a lot of trading range trading ahead of the report because the rally is at resistance. This reduces the chance of a big trend up or down before the 11 am PST announcement.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-gap-closure.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-29.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and gap closure\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is now testing the November low and the 1.10 Big Round Number.<p>January traded above the December high and below the December low. It is therefore an outside down candlestick on the monthly chart.<p>While bearish, it is less so since the monthly chart has been in a tight trading range for 6 months. There is often an inside month after an outside month. Also, tight trading ranges typically have buyers below. Consequently, despite the unusually strong selloff, there is still a 50% chance that it will end around the November low and not continue to below the October low.<p>While the past 8 bars are forming a parabolic wedge sell climax, there is no bottom yet. Because the channel is tight has mostly bear bars, the bulls will probably need at least a micro double bottom before they can get a 2 week, 200 pip bounce.<p>There is an FOMC announcement today at 11 am. Because it typically results in a quick move up and down within the 1st few minutes, day traders should exit positions ahead of the report. They should wait at least 10 minutes after the report before resuming trading.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above yesterday’s high overnight and it just went below yesterday’s low. Today is therefore an outside down day. However, it is at the support of the bottom of a 4 month trading range. Also, it only fell 4 pips below yesterday’s low. Finally, it has been in a 15 pip range for 6 hours. Day traders are currently looking for scalps.<p>Because the EURUSD is at major support, there is an increased chance of a strong bear breakout and of a reversal up. Today’s FOMC report is a potential catalyst for a strong move up or down. But as long as the range and bars are small, day traders will continue to look for scalps.<p>Friday is the end of the month. Since January is now an outside down month, the December low will be important for rest of the week. The EURUSD might get stuck in a tight range around that low for the rest of the week.<p>The bears want Friday to close far below the December low. That would increase the chance of lower prices in February. The bulls want January to close far above the December low. Traders would then look for a leg up from the bottom of the 4 month range over the next 2 weeks.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bear-trend-resumption-after-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption after FOMC announcement\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The breakout failed, but so did the reversal down to near the low. The Emini closed near its low. It is a sell signal bar for tomorrow on the daily chart.<p>Did today’s 3292.75 high adequately test 3300? It might have, but most bulls expect the Emini to get closer. The odds still favor a 2nd leg down to below 3200 over the next few weeks. But that 2nd leg down might not come without a test of 3300 first.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It usually takes at least 10 minutes before a trend will begin.<p>Even if the bulls get a rally up to the January high, the Emini will probably be sideways to down for at least a couple weeks. The upside is therefore limited.<p>But because the bull trend is so strong on the weekly and monthly chart, the downside is probably limited as well. With limited up and down, traders should expect that the 4 month buy climax will evolve into a trading range for at least a couple weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 7 points in the Globex session. It might gap above yesterday’s high. That would create a 2 day island bottom with Monday’s gap down. However, island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns. A gap up today is therefore not a major buy signal today.<p>I have been saying that the Emini might have to test 3300 before the bears can get a 2nd leg down. This rally is that test.<p>The Emini will probably not break strongly above or reverse strongly down ahead of today’s FOMC report. Also, while yesterday was a big bull day, it was mostly sideways for the final 4 hours. Day traders are expecting a lot of trading range trading ahead of the report because the rally is at resistance. This reduces the chance of a big trend up or down before the 11 am PST announcement.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-gap-closure.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-29.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and gap closure\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is now testing the November low and the 1.10 Big Round Number.<p>January traded above the December high and below the December low. It is therefore an outside down candlestick on the monthly chart.<p>While bearish, it is less so since the monthly chart has been in a tight trading range for 6 months. There is often an inside month after an outside month. Also, tight trading ranges typically have buyers below. Consequently, despite the unusually strong selloff, there is still a 50% chance that it will end around the November low and not continue to below the October low.<p>While the past 8 bars are forming a parabolic wedge sell climax, there is no bottom yet. Because the channel is tight has mostly bear bars, the bulls will probably need at least a micro double bottom before they can get a 2 week, 200 pip bounce.<p>There is an FOMC announcement today at 11 am. Because it typically results in a quick move up and down within the 1st few minutes, day traders should exit positions ahead of the report. They should wait at least 10 minutes after the report before resuming trading.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above yesterday’s high overnight and it just went below yesterday’s low. Today is therefore an outside down day. However, it is at the support of the bottom of a 4 month trading range. Also, it only fell 4 pips below yesterday’s low. Finally, it has been in a 15 pip range for 6 hours. Day traders are currently looking for scalps.<p>Because the EURUSD is at major support, there is an increased chance of a strong bear breakout and of a reversal up. Today’s FOMC report is a potential catalyst for a strong move up or down. But as long as the range and bars are small, day traders will continue to look for scalps.<p>Friday is the end of the month. Since January is now an outside down month, the December low will be important for rest of the week. The EURUSD might get stuck in a tight range around that low for the rest of the week.<p>The bears want Friday to close far below the December low. That would increase the chance of lower prices in February. The bulls want January to close far above the December low. Traders would then look for a leg up from the bottom of the 4 month range over the next 2 weeks.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bear-trend-resumption-after-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-29-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption after FOMC announcement\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The breakout failed, but so did the reversal down to near the low. The Emini closed near its low. It is a sell signal bar for tomorrow on the daily chart.<p>Did today’s 3292.75 high adequately test 3300? It might have, but most bulls expect the Emini to get closer. The odds still favor a 2nd leg down to below 3200 over the next few weeks. But that 2nd leg down might not come without a test of 3300 first.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The high got to within 7 points of the 3300 Big Round Number. I talked about how that was an important price in mid-January and therefore a magnet. I also said that the 1st reversal up might last only 2 days.<p>Yesterday is a Low 1 sell signal bar for the bears who are hoping that a bear trend began last week. It is a sell setup, but many traders expect a better test of 3300 before the 2nd leg down begins.<p>The 2 day reversal up was big enough to create confusion. Since the chart is not clear, the Emini might have to go sideways for a week or more before the 2nd leg down begins. The odds are that this selloff will fall to below 3200 within a few weeks. A 5% correction down to 3177 is a reasonable minimum target.<p>I mentioned several times recently that January might close around its open when the month ends on Friday. That is still a reasonable possibility. There will probably be a big gap down today to around the open of the month.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 18 points in the Globex session. There will therefore be a big gap down.<p>When there is a big gap down, the Emini is far below the EMA. Traders do not like to sell far below the average price. That reduces the likelihood of a big selloff on the open after a gap down. They prefer to sell near the average price.<p>The result is that the Emini often goes sideways for an hour or two until it gets closer to the EMA. That trading range usually has both a buy and a sell setup.<p>The chart is then in breakout mode. The bulls look for a double bottom or wedge bottom and then a swing up. However, the bears want a double top or wedge top near the EMA and then a swing down.<p>If there is a trading range open, it is a sign of a balanced market. It reduces the chance of a relentless trend up or down. If there is a swing up or down after the initial trading range, it typically leads to a 2 – 4 hour swing. Then, traders look for either a trading range or an opposite swing.<p>The Emini is back to around the open of the month. I have been saying that the open would be a magnet this week and that the Emini might end the month around the open. Today’s gap down makes that likely. Traders should expect it to be a magnet for today and tomorrow. That reduces the chance of a big move out of this area before tomorrow’s close.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bear-trend-resumption-after-FOMC-announcement.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-30.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend resumption after FOMC announcement\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is the buy zone. But even if the selloff continues down to the October low, traders will still look for a 2 – 3 week, 200 pip rally. That is because every strong leg up and down for the past 20 months reversed within a few weeks. There is no reason to assume that this 5 week selloff will be different.<p>Also, after a break below the neckline of a head and shoulders top, there is usually a rally back to the breakout point. That is a breakout test. Traders want to see if the bears will sell again at that price. Will the breakout continue down for one or more legs, or will it fail? There are often 2 – 3 possible prices for the neckline. Traders expect a bounce up to the December 6 low or even the January 10 low within a week or two.<p>On the monthly chart, January is an outside down month. The month closes tomorrow. The bears want January to close far below the December low. That is unlikely because the monthly chart has been in a tight trading range for 6 months. Tight ranges resist breaking out. Consequently, January will probably close around or above the December low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied slightly overnight. It just broke above yesterday’s high. Yesterday was an outside down day on the daily chart. Today is therefore breaking above the neckline of a 2 day micro double bottom.<p>The daily chart is oversold and the December low is a magnet above on the monthly chart. Traders should expect sideways to up trading through tomorrow’s close when January ends.<p>That does not mean a strong bull trend. All the bulls need is slightly higher prices. Traders so far are not looking for a big trend up. But they will buy any 20 – 30 pip selloff through tomorrow’s close, knowing that January will likely close near or above the 1.1040 December low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-breakout-above-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-30-2.png\" alt=\"Emini breakout above triangle\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It reversed up twice from the open of the month. Late in the day, it strongly broke above a 5 hour triangle and closed on its high. It is now a buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The reversal up was strong enough to give the bulls a 50% chance of a rally back up to a new high without a 5% correction. There is a 50% chance of a reversal down from a double top around 3300 or the all-time high and then a 5% correction.<p>As I have been saying for the past week, the open of the month would be important at the end of this week. The monthly candlestick closes tomorrow. The bears want a close below the open. January would then be a sell signal bar for February. Today’s reversal up from the open of the month was strong enough so that January will probably close in the middle or top of its range.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is a buy signal bar on the daily chart for a micro double bottom in a bull trend. I wrote this week that the Emini might have to test 3300 before a 2nd leg down begins. That is more likely after yesterday’s reversal up. The Emini is back to almost neutral. There is is now almost a 50% chance of a new high before there is a 5% correction.<p>The bulls want a double top bear flag with Wednesday’s high or a Low 2 bear flag.

Today twice reversed up strongly from below the open of the month. It now is in the middle of the month’s range.<p>A close below the midpoint would mean that January would be a reversal bar. But if it has a bull body, which is likely, it would be a weak sell signal bar. We already know that the context is bad for the bears on the monthly chart. The best they probably can get is a 1 – 2 month pullback.<p>Can it still close below the open of the month? It would then have a bear body and January would then be a sell signal bar on the monthly chart. While this is still possible, yesterday’s late strong rally make it unlikely.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 13 points in the Globex session. It has been sideways for 4 days and it is now at the top of the small trading range. The range has a double bottom.<p>While the bulls hope that yesterday’s rally from the double bottom will continue to a new all-time high, the bears want it to fail around Wednesday’s high. They want a reversal down from a small double top and for this week’s selloff to continue down for at least 5%. Traders will find out over the next few days which outcome will be more likely.<p>Because yesterday’s rally was climactic, there should be some profit-taking today. Traders typically expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading beginning by the end of the 2nd hour. If often begins on the open. There is only a 25% chance of a strong bull trend day from the open that lasts all day.<p>Monthly and weekly support and resistance can be important today since today is Friday and the last day of the month. The most important magnets are the month’s open, high and midpoint.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-breakout-above-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-31.png\" alt=\"Emini breakout above triangle\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There are consecutive parabolic wedge bottoms. That increases the chance of a reversal up soon.<p>However, the bear channel is tight. A tight bear channel typically needs at least a micro double bottom before a bull leg can begin. Consequently, this reversal will probably be minor.<p>It is a test of the neckline of the head and shoulders top. That means it is testing the lows that the selloff broke below. The most important is the January 10 low of 1.1085. Traders should expect the rally to end around 1.11 next week and for the bears to then get a test of this week’s lows. They see that every strong rally and selloff for 20 months reverse after a few weeks and are confident that this selloff will do the same.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has rallied overnight. The 1.11 area around the January 10 low is a magnet above.<p>Can the EURUSD reach it today? Probably not. This is because the bull trend over the past couple hours has only covered about 30 pips and most of the bars are small. That is not how a strong bull trend typically looks.<p>This price action increases the chance that the 5 minute chart will convert into a trading range today. But since there is a magnet above and the chart has rallied for 2 days, the odds favor sideways to higher prices.<p>At some point today, the bulls will probably stop buying at the market and switch to buying 20 pip pullbacks. If that happens, the bears will begin to look for scalps. Until then, it is better to only buy.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-small-pullback-bear-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-1-31-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and small pullback bear trend\n\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was a huge bear day. One saying on Wall Street is, “The strongest rallies come in bear trends.” While that is not true, it is a reminder that a strong rally in a bear trend, like yesterday, does not mean that the bear trend has ended. The bears got a strong reversal down today from a double top with Wednesday’s high. That shifts the probability back in favor of a 5% correction being underway.<p>January now closed near its low and the monthly chart is in a buy climax. The monthly sell signal will probably trigger next week. I have been saying that the minimum goal for the bears is at least a 5% pullback. Nothing has changed. The odds favor at least a little more down. The selloff might continue down to around 3000 and the top of the 2 year trading range.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is a buy signal bar on the daily chart for a micro double bottom in a bull trend. I wrote this week that the Emini might have to test 3300 before a 2nd leg down begins. That is more likely after yesterday’s reversal up. The Emini is back to almost neutral. There is is now almost a 50% chance of a new high before there is a 5% correction.<p>The bulls want a double top bear flag with Wednesday’s high or a Low 2 bear flag. If instead the bulls get another one or two more bull bars, the Emini will probably test the all-time high.<h3>The monthly candlestick closes today</h3><p>I have been saying for the past week that the open of the month would be a magnet at the end of the month.
