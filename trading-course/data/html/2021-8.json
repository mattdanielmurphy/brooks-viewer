If so, the Emini will probably correct 15 to 20% into October.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex monthly chart formed a small doji bar in July after a big bear bar in June. It is near the bottom of a yearlong trading range. It should bounce in August. On the weekly chart, this week was the 1st pullback in an 9-bar bear micro channel. The 1<sup>st</sup>reversal up should only last a few bars before there is a test back down.<h2>EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3>The EURUSD<em>monthly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has trading range\"></a></figure><ul><li>On the monthly EURUSD Forex chart, July was a small doji bar. It is a weak buy signal bar for a higher low in a bull channel, especially after the big bear bar in June.<li>A weak buy setup usually leads to a bounce and not a bull trend. Therefore, August should go above the July high, but the rally will probably not reach the May high.<li>After the big bear bar in June, there was no follow-through from the bears.<li>Possible end to a 2-legged pullback from January and a bounce from a higher low wedge bull flag.</ul><h3>The EURUSD<em>weekly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-head-and-shoulders-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-1-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has head and shoulders top\"></a></figure><ul><li>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart rallied this week. The rally should test the June 25 bull bar within a few weeks.<li>However, this week had a prominent tail above.<li>Also, the context is bad for the bulls. Last week was a bear bar, which is a weak buy signal bar.<li>Additionally, the EURUSD has been in a bear microchannel for 9 weeks. Traders will therefore likely sell within a couple of weeks, expecting a test of last week’s low and possibly the March 2021 low.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a strong break below the November 2020 low, which is the bottom of the yearlong trading range and the neckline of the head and shoulders top.<li>The selloff is reversing up from just above the neckline of the Head &amp; Shoulders pattern. The bears needed a follow-through bar, but EURUSD reversed higher and became a failed breakout instead.<li>A possible wedge bull flag higher low reversal if the bull can get follow-through buying over the next few bars.</ul><h2>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3>The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-SP-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-streak-of-6-consecutive-bull-bars.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P monthly candlestick chart has streak of 6 consecutive bull bars. Likely bear candlestick in August.\"></a></figure><ul><li>July was the 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar. This has not happened in 10 years. Therefore, a 7<sup>th</sup>bull bar would be even more unusual. Consequently, August should be a bear bar.&nbsp;<li>If it is, the yearlong rally will be a parabolic wedge. That should lead to 2 to 3 months of sideways to down trading.<li>But, because the bull trend is so strong, traders will buy the pullback, even if it is 20%.<li>The bears have not yet been able to create a bear bar or even a bull bar with a prominent tail on top for 6 months.&nbsp;The bulls are buying aggressively into the close of every month and that increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices.<li>Sometimes in a buy vacuum, sellers stop selling until the price reaches measured moves and targets above.<li>The next measured move is 4537 based on the height of the pandemic.<li>It would also be a trend channel line overshoot which increases the odds that we will see sellers appear.</ul><h3>The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-SP-weekly-candlestick-chart-doji-bar-in-middle-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-1-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P weekly candlestick chart doji bar in middle of bull channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>This week was a bear doji bar. That is a weak sell signal bar, but the weekly chart is extremely overbought.<li>The bulls were not able to create a follow-through bar after breaking into new highs from last week’s outside bull bar.<li>It has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for more than 60 bars, which is unusual, and therefore unsustainable and climactic.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend ends with a big pullback. The biggest pullback so far was the 10% selloff in September. A bigger pullback means 15 to 20%.<li>Traders have bought every reversal for a year. They know the odds are that reversals will fail.<li>However, they also know that one should be successful soon.<li>When there is a successful trend reversal, there is not a consensus that it will succeed until it is already half over.<li>Until there is a strong, clear reversal, traders will continue to bull every 1 – 2 bar (week) selloff.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend is a sign of very eager bulls. They are buying small pullbacks because they doubt there will be a big pullback.<li>Even once there is a big pullback (15 – 20%), they will still buy it, betting that there will be a test of the old high. Consequently, the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down will still be minor, even if it is 20%.<li>The next targets for the bulls are the trend channel line and the measured move around 4537.</ul><h3>The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-SP-daily-candlestick-chart-expanding-triangle-top-and-micro-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-1-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P daily candlestick chart expanding triangle top and micro double top\"></a></figure><ul><li>Friday triggered a micro double top sell signal, but Thursday was a bull bar. This is therefore a low-probability sell signal.<li>There is also an expanding top with the July 7 and July 14 highs, and the Emini is near the top of the bull channel, using the May 7 and July 14 highs.&nbsp;<li>Until there is a strong reversal down, traders will continue to bet on new highs.<li>Bear bars have tails below and small bodies, which means the bears are not selling into the close of bars. They lack conviction and are unwilling to sell low.<li>Also, there are no consecutive strong bear bars.<li>Until the bulls aggressively take profits and the bears generate sustained, aggressive selling, the bulls remain in control.</ul><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It could be the start of a reversal down from a double top bear flag.<li>Yesterday was a small day, but it had a bear body. Even thought the bear body was small, a bear body was the minimum needed to confirm Wednesday’s reversal down. A confirmed bear breakout is likely to have at least slightly lower prices.<li>Today so far is a big bear day just after the jobs report.<li>Since the July 21 low was a sell climax, traders expect a 2<sup>nd</sup>leg up from a higher low. Therefore, the current selloff should reverse up from above that low. There is sometimes a double bottom after a reversal up from a wedge bottom.<li>Because the EURUSD is near the bottom of a yearlong trading range and most trading range breakouts fail, traders expect a reversal up soon back to the middle of the range.<li>That middle area is also around the June 25 major lower high, which was the start of the month-long bear channel and therefore an important magnet.<li>The July low is the neckline of the July 7/July 30 double top bear flag. A 150-pip measured move down would be a test of the November bottom of the yearlong trading range at 1.16.<li>The bears need a strong break below the November low before traders will look for much lower prices.<li>Since most breakout attempts fail, there should be more buyers than sellers below that low and below the July low. Consequently, the EURUSD should begin a move back up to the June 25 high at around 1.20 before going much lower.</ul><h3>Last day of the week so weekly support and resistance can be important today</h3><ul><li>Today is the last day of the week. Weekly support and resistance can be magnets, especially in the final hour.<li>This week so far is a bear bar closing near its low.<li>Its high and low are within last week’s range so this week so far is an inside bar. It is therefore both a buy and sell signal bar for next week.<li>It is a Low 1 sell signal bar after a 9-bar bear micro channel.<li>The more the week closes on its low, the more likely next week will trade below this week’s low.<li>However, because the EURUSD is near the bottom of a yearlong trading range, it probably will have a difficult time falling much below 1.16 at the bottom of the range.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SP500-Emini-Trading-Range-Day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-6-2.png\" alt=\"SP500 Emini Trading Range Day\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Trading range open, and today remained a trading range day, despite a late bear trap.<li>Entire day became big triangle.

A bigger pullback means 15 to 20%.<li>The bears have not been able to create strong bear bars or consecutive bear bars.<li>There are also no prominent tails above bars. This means the bulls have been buying into closes, and they do that because they expect the next bar to be higher.<li>The move up is in a tight bull channel which is also a sign of strength for the bulls.<li>Until the bulls aggressively take profits, the bears will not sell.

Emini broke above bull channel top.<li>The day after an outside up day often has a lot of overlap with the outside up day. It is sometimes an inside day. It is usually not a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive big bull day, even in a strong bull trend.<li>The Emini also broke slightly above the top of the 4-month bull channel on the daily chart yesterday, and it closed above the channel.<li>The bulls want consecutive closes above the top of the channel. That would increase the chance of at least several more days of higher prices.<li>As strong as the bull trend is, there is a 75% chance of the start of a reversal back down to the middle of the channel by the 5<sup>th</sup>day above the channel. Consequently, it will probably not go much higher before there is at least a 2- to 3-day pullback.<li>The next magnet above is the 4500 Big Round Number. The rally might have to reach it before traders will look to take profits.<li>The bears want a couple bear days closing below the top of the channel. That would increase the chance of a reversal down to at least the middle of the channel, especially if the bear days are big and close near their lows.<li>The bears are hoping for a reversal down into the end of the month so that August will close below the open of the month.<li>If August has a bear body on the monthly chart, traders will expect 2 to 3 months of sideways to down trading. August would be a sell signal bar for a minor reversal down from a parabolic wedge buy climax.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 22 points in the overnight Globex session. It will probably open in the middle of yesterday’s range, which increases the chance that today will mostly overlap with yesterday’s range.<li>It also increases the chance that today will be an inside bar. There will probably be a reversal up from around yesterday’s low or down from around yesterday’s high.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day. The day after a buy climax day has a 50% chance of follow-through buying in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour or so, but only a 25% chance of being a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive big bull day.<li>Also, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour. With today likely opening in the middle of yesterday’s range, the trading range might begin on the open.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Emini-wedge-sell-climax-and-then-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-17.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge sell climax and then small pullback bull trend with break above bull channel top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/EURUSD-Forex-reversing-up-from-double-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-17-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>Yesterday was a Low 1 sell signal bar in a bear trend that began in May. Today triggered the sell signal by trading below yesterday’s low.<li>However, Friday was a Bull Surprise Bar after a reversal up from a double bottom with the March low. That makes it more likely that there will be more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low. The odds favor at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up.<li>The bulls hope that the EURUSD will trade up for several weeks to above the July 30 high.<li>The bears hope Friday was just a Bull Trap in a bear channel. They are hoping that today’s selloff will continue tomorrow, which would make a test of the August low likely.<li>At the moment, the chart has both a bear flag and a reversal up from a double bottom. Today and tomorrow will tell us which of the 2 outcomes will succeed.<li>The more bearish the bars are, the more likely the bear trend is resuming. The more bullish they are, the more likely the bulls will make another attempt to break above the EMA and continue up to the July 30 high.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Emini-wedge-top-and-double-top-then-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-17-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and double top then bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Big gap down, then wedge rally to higher high double top at EMA.<li>Strong selloff to below low of last week so this week is now outside down. If week closes below last week’s low, probably will go lower next week.<li>Midday reversal back to midpoint of day’s range.<li>Open of month is just below today’s low. Remember, August or September should be bear bar on monthly chart and begin 2- to 3-month correction of 15 to 20%. But the bears need a bear bar on the monthly chart, else Emini will continue up at least a little more.<li>Bulls hope today is a bear trap, but need strong bull day tomorrow. More likely will test open of month before end of month.<li>Today is a High 1 buy signal bar on the daily chart. Its bear body makes it a weak buy setup. There might be more sellers than buyers above its high.<li>Since today had a big reversal but closed just above the middle of the range, there is confusion. That increases the chance of a sideways day tomorrow.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This time, it closed below.<li>It also closed below the open of the month and below the 4400 Big Round Number.<li>At the end of July, I wrote that August might rally in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the month because July was strong, but then sell off to below the open of the month in the 2<sup>nd</sup>half because of the streak of 6 bull bars on the monthly chart is unusual. Yesterday traded below the open of the month.<li>But will August close below the open of the month? Traders will find out over the next week.<li>I have been saying that either August or September should have a bear body on the monthly chart since there has never been a streak of 8 consecutive bull bars on the monthly chart in the 25-year history of the Emini.<li>I have also been saying that if August or September is a bear bar, the Emini will probably be sideways to down for 2 to 3 months, and fall 15 to 20 percent.<li>The next target down is the bottom of the bull channel on the daily chart. It is currently around 4360.<li>That is also near the August 3 low. The rally from the July 19 low has been a Spike and Channel Bull Trend. When it ends, it usually evolves into a trading range. The bottom of the trading range is often near the start of the channel, which was the August 3 low.<li>That low is additionally important because it is the low of the month. If the Emini finishes the month on the low, not only will the month have a bear body, it will be a strong sell signal bar. That would increase the chance of a 15 to 20% correction.<li>While the context is good for a reversal down, it is important to note that there have been many big 2- and 3-day selloffs since the pandemic low. Each one led to a new high.<li>By the time traders believe that a reversal down will lead to a correction, the correction is typically about half over.<li>If there is strong follow-through selling over the next few days, traders will conclude that the correction has begun.<li>If not, they will buy again, expecting another new high.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is 32 points down in the overnight Globex session. There will be a big gap down.<li>A big gap increases the chance of a trend day in either direction. However, after 2 extremely big bear days, a third big bear day would be unusual.<li>Yesterday was a sell climax day. There is therefore only a 25% chance of another big bear day today. If there is a bear trend, it will probably not be strong. It would more likely be a Trending Trading Range Day or a Broad Bear Channel, both of which have a lot of sideways trading.<li>But, there is a 50% chance of some follow-through selling in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour. If there is, traders should watch for a reversal up.<li>Also, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that begins by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>With the Emini extremely oversold and still in a bull trend, there is an increased chance of a bull trend today.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Emini-late-sell-the-close-bear-trend-after-FOMC-minutes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-19.jpg\" alt=\"Emini late sell the close bear trend after FOMC minutes\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If it closes around where it is, today will be a reversal bar with a small body. That would be a 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive doji bar, which means more neutrality, despite the bear trend.<li>Traders are still deciding if the selloff has to test the November low, which is the bottom of the yearlong trading range, or reverse up.<li>A weak bear breakout and a weak buy signal creates confusion, which usually results in sideways trading for a day or two.<li>Less likely, today could be a big trend day in either direction.<li>The bears want strong follow-through selling, which would make a test of the November low likely. That is unlikely with today reversing up after an initial selloff.<li>The bulls want a strong reversal up, which would make a test of the August 13 lower high likely within a week or so.<li>With yesterday being a doji bar and today so far being a 2nd doji bar, a big bull will probably not form.<li>The fight today could be over the close of the day. If there is a bull body, the bigger the body, the more likely the EURUSD will trade higher tomorrow.<li>The bears want a bear body and the close to be below the midpoint. That would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices tomorrow.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/EMINI-bull-trend-from-the-open-at-bottom-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-19-2.png\" alt=\"EMINI bull trend from the open at bottom of bull channel\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Big gap down, but then big Bull Surprise Bar.

Closed just below open of month.<li>Remember, the bulls want August to close above the open of the month. I have been saying since late July that the open of August could be the most important magnet all month.<li>On daily chart, test of April 3 low, which was start of bull channel after spike up from July 19. Should lead to a trading range for a week or two.<li>High 1 on daily chart just above bottom of bull channel, but after 2 big days down so probably minor reversal.

There were many small, tight trading ranges with small Breakout Mode Patterns (OO, ii, ioi, ledges), but none led to a big trend.<li>After the 3-day rally, the bulls want Trend Resumption Up. They expect a breakout above the bull channel on the daily chart, which is around the 4500 Big Round Number and just above today’s high.<li>The bears want a higher high double top with the August 16 high, but will probably need a micro double top before there is more than a 1- to 3-day pullback.<li>There are 5 trading days remaining in August. So far, August is the 7<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar on the monthly chart, which is unusual. The open of the month is about 100 points below and therefore within reach by the end of the month.<li>If the bears get a bear bar on the monthly chart this month or next, especially one with a close near the low, it will probably be the start of a 2- to 3-month pullback.<li>If August is a bull bar, September should be a bear bar because there have never been 8 consecutive bull bars on the monthly chart. If it is, it will then probably be the start of the pullback.<li>Until there is a strong reversal down, the bulls will continue to buy every 1- to 3-day selloff, even if the bear bars are big.

That is a blow-off top, and it would probably lead to at least a couple months of sideways to down trading.<li>Until there is a clear top, traders continue to buy, correctly betting on higher prices.<li>The bears want the month to close below the open of the month at 4408.00. There are 5 trading days remaining in August, and that is within reach.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 4 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday was a buy climax day. There is only a 25% chance today will be another Small Pullback Bull Trend Day.<li>In addition, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading starting by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour. This is true even though the 2<sup>nd</sup>half of yesterday already formed a trading range.<li>The bears see a lower high major trend reversal in that trading range and hope for a break below the trading range today.<li>The bears want a reversal down after 3 strong days up, but bulls will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>1- to 3-day pullback.<li>A trading range is Breakout Mode. That means there is about a 50% chance of a successful breakout up or down, and a 50% chance that the 1<sup>st</sup>breakout will fail and reverse.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-from-the-open-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-24.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend from the open at all-time high.

When a market gets near important resistance, it usually tests it at least twice before the bulls will give up and the market reverses.<li>Bulls want big breakout above, and then an even stronger bull trend. That happens 25% of the time, and it happens because traders who have been selling for the past 20 – 30 bars (days) finally give up.<li>75% of the time, a breakout above the top of a bull channel fails by about the 5<sup>th</sup>bar. However, those 5 bars can still be still very big, and therefore there is a reasonable chance of a sharp rally over the next week.<li>If the bears get a reversal down within a week, it will be from a higher high major trend reversal and from an expanding triangle that began with the July 26 high.<li>Even though strong rally for 5 days, each day has had at least a couple hours in a trading range. Traders will expect at least some trading range trading today, whether or not there is a bull or bear trend.</ul><h3>Monthly chart</h3><ul><li>The bears want a reversal down into the end of the month because they would like a bear bar on the monthly chart.

That has only happened twice before in the 25-year history of the Emini.<li>If it does, then September should be a bear bar because there has never been a streak of 8 consecutive bull bars in the 25-year history of the Emini.

A pullback is a day with a high below the high of the prior day.<li>Most recent days were bull bars on the daily chart, but had a lot of trading range trading on the 5-minute chart. Traders should expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading at some point today.<li>With only 4 trading days left in August and with the Emini overbought and at the top of its bull channel, traders should be ready for a surprisingly big move up or down before the end of the month.

When a market gets near important resistance, it usually tests it at least twice before the bulls will give up and the market reverses.<li>Bulls want big breakout above, and then an even stronger bull trend. That happens 25% of the time, and it happens because traders who have been selling for the past 20 – 30 bars (days) finally give up.<li>75% of the time, a breakout above the top of a bull channel fails by about the 5<sup>th</sup>bar. However, those 5 bars can still be still very big, and therefore there is a reasonable chance of a sharp rally over the next week.<li>If the bears get a reversal down within a week, it will be from a higher high major trend reversal and from an expanding triangle that began with the July 26 high.<li>Even though strong rally for 5 days, each day has had at least a couple hours in a trading range. Traders will expect at least some trading range trading today, whether or not there is a bull or bear trend.</ul><h3>Monthly chart</h3><ul><li>The bears want a reversal down into the end of the month because they would like a bear bar on the monthly chart. The open of the month is about 100 points down and there are only 4 trading days left in August. At the moment, a bear close is not likely, but surprisingly big moves are more common at the end of a month.<li>Not only do the bears want a bear bar on the monthly chart, they want it to have a big bear body. That means they want the month to close 50 or more points below the open, which is even less likely.<li>August will probably be the 7<sup>th</sup>consecutive month with a bull body on the monthly chart. That has only happened twice before in the 25-year history of the Emini.<li>If it does, then September should be a bear bar because there has never been a streak of 8 consecutive bull bars in the 25-year history of the Emini. Every streak eventually gets broken, but since that happens rarely, it is more likely that September will be a bear bar.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 5 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>After 5 days without a pullback, there will probably be a pullback within the next few days. A pullback is a day with a high below the high of the prior day.<li>Most recent days were bull bars on the daily chart, but had a lot of trading range trading on the 5-minute chart. Traders should expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading at some point today.<li>With only 4 trading days left in August and with the Emini overbought and at the top of its bull channel, traders should be ready for a surprisingly big move up or down before the end of the month. Will it happen? I said “surprisingly.” If it was likely, it would not be a surprise, but be ready just in case. A big day can go much further than what seems reasonable in the middle of the day.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-trading-range-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-26.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then trading range.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit.

The day after a buy climax day has a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that begins by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.<li>Two trading days left in August, and the Emini is far above the open of the month. August will probably have a bull body and be the 7<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar on the monthly chart.<li>There has never been a streak of 8 consecutive bull bars on the monthly chart in the 25-year history of the Emini. Therefore, September will probably have a bear body.<li>If it does, that should lead to a 2- to 3-month correction of 15 to 20%.<li>Bars often change their appearance just before they close. August is a bull bar that is currently trading at the high with 2 days left in the month. That means there is an increased risk of a 50-point selloff over the next two days. It would take about 50 points of selling to add a noticeable tail on the top of the monthly candlestick.<li>Alternatively, the bulls would be happy having the month close near the high. That would increase the chance of a gap up on the monthly chart on Wednesday.<li>There is no great need for a rally over the next couple days. The bulls will have accomplished a lot if they can simply keep the Emini near its high through the end of the month tomorrow.<li>There have been many reversal attempts on the daily chart over the past year and a half. Traders bought every one, correctly betting against a successful reversal.<li>They will continue to bet on higher prices until there is a very strong reversal down. Once they see a reversal down that is strong enough to make them think a correction is underway, the correction will be half over.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 6 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>It will likely gap up, which would create a gap on the weekly chart as well as the daily chart.<li>If it does and the gap is small, it will probably close in the 1<sup>st</sup>hour.<li>Friday was a buy climax day. There is therefore a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour today.<li>Friday formed a trading range for the 2<sup>nd</sup>half of the day. That also increases the chance of an early trading range today.<li>With the Emini overbought and at the high of the month at the end of the month, there is a reduced chance of a big bull day.<li>The bears want a 50-point selloff before tomorrow’s close.<li>Most likely, the Emini will be mostly sideways around the high of the month today and tomorrow.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Emini-spike-and-channel-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-8-30.png\" alt=\"Emini spike and channel bull trend from the open.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.
