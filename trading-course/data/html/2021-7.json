The magnets above are the top of the bull channel and measured move targets. Since there have been 11 days without a pullback, there should be a brief pullback next week.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has been in a trading range for a year with no sign that it is about to end. If July reverses up, there will be a triangle. If July continues down, it will probably not fall far below the bottom of the range.<h2>EURUSD Forex market</h2><h3>The EURUSD<em>monthly</em>chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart in trading range\"></a></figure><ul><li>June was big bear bar. It closed on its low and far below the May low.<li>Reversing down from a lower high after last year’s wedge rally to a double top with the February 2018 high.<li>Bears want a trend reversal. They hope for a break below the November low at the bottom of the yearlong trading range and then a measured move down to the 2017 low.<li>But markets resist change, and the market is in a trading range. This selloff therefore will probably not break strongly below the November low.<li>More likely, the trading range will continue, even if there is a small break below that low.<li>Last month was a Bear Surprise Bar. But it is in a trading range, and therefore reversals are more likely than trends.<li>There have been many big bull and bear bars over the past year. Every one reversed immediately or after one more bar. That is what is likely this time.<li>That means there might be some follow-through selling in July, but July will probably not break strongly below the range.<li>So far, July is reversing up from below the June low. If the reversal up continues, but forms a lower high, then there will be a triangle that began in November.</ul><h2>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3>The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-strong-bull-trend-buy-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-3-1.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart in strong bull trend buy parabolic wedge extreme buy climax.\"></a></figure><ul><li>July gapped above the June high by 1 tick. Small gaps typically quickly close, and this one closed within the 1<sup>st</sup>few minutes of the month on Thursday.<li>Next monthly target is measured move up at 4,537, based on height of pandemic crash (from February 2020 high to March 2020 low).<li>June was the 5<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar. There have not been 6 consecutive bull bars since the pandemic low. That increases the chance that July will close below its open.<li>If July has a bear body, July would be the end of a parabolic wedge rally (3 legs up in a tight bull channel) from the March 2020 low. That would probably lead to profit taking and a 2- to 3-month sideways to down pullback.<li>Traders will buy that 1<sup>st</sup>pullback, and therefore it should be only a minor reversal in a strong bull trend.</ul><h3>The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-small-pullback-bull-trend-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart in small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><ul><li>Tight bull channel so strong bull trend. Next targets are the top of the bull channel and the measured move based on the height of the pandemic crash.<li>Small Pullback Bull Trend for more than 60 bars, which is getting unusual. That increases the chance of the strong bull trend converting into a weaker bull trend.<li>A Small Pullback Bull Trend ends with a big pullback. “Big” means bigger than any pullback in the Small Pullback Bull Trend. The biggest pullback was 10% and it lasted 2 months (September and October).<li>Therefore, the strong trend will end once there is a 15 – 20% pullback. That pullback will probably last more than 2 months, and it will probably come this year.<li>There is no sign that the pullback is about to begin, other than this trend lasting longer than most Small Pullback Bull Trends.<li>Traders will buy the selloff, even if it is 20%. A 20% selloff is a bear “market.”<li>But it will likely only be a pullback on the weekly and monthly charts, not a bear trend.<li>A bear trend is a series of lower highs and lows, and it typically lasts at least 20 bars.<li>While that could happen this year on the daily chart, it should not happen on the weekly or monthly charts.<li>The best the bears can hope to get this year is a trading range for a few months.<li>The low could be as much as 20% down from the high, but traders will buy it, expecting at least a test of the old high, which would be the top of the trading range.<li>The bulls hope that the rally from the pullback low will be a resumption of the yearlong bull trend and not simply a test of the old high.</ul><h3>The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-in-strong-bull-trend-with-meausred-move-and-top-on-bull-channel-as-next-resistance-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-3-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart in strong bull trend with meausred move and top on bull channel as next resistance\"></a></figure><ul><li>Strong rally from the June 18 low.<li>11-bar bull micro channel.

Emini likely in developing trading range.<li>There are 5 bull bars on the monthly chart and July will probably not be the sixth. Therefore, even if the Emini continues to rally, it will probably end the month below the open of the month.<li>Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar for today, and the bull trend has been strong. But, the big tail on top makes it a weak buy signal bar.<li>I have been saying for the past week that the Emini will probably be mostly sideways for a week or more after extreme buy climaxes on the daily and 60-minute chart. Therefore, traders should expect reversals every few days.<li>Today will probably open back above the 60-minute EMA. The Emini might have to oscillate around it for several day after being above it for 70 bars, which is an extreme buy climax.<li>Since a trading range is likely on the 60-minute and daily charts, traders should also expect disappointment. That reduces the chance that tomorrow will be a strong entry bar for the bulls.<li>When the daily chart is in a trading range, the 5-minute chart tends to spend more time in trading ranges. There should be at least one swing up and one swing down today and either can come first.<li>Everybody knows that the market has rallied for a long time without more than a 10% pullback. That is unusual. There should be a 15 – 20% pullback before the end of the year.<li>Mid-July through mid-October is a common time for corrections. Did it begin yesterday? In a bull trend, the odds are that every bear day will be followed by a new high. The bears need several strong bear days before traders will conclude that the 15% correction has begun.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 21 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>It will probably open back above the 60-minute EMA.<li>The streak of 70 consecutive bars above the EMA on the 60-minute charts was one of the most extreme buy climaxes on that chart in years. That increases the chance that the Emini will have to oscillate around it for several days.<li>While yesterday is a buy signal bar on the daily chart, it had a big tail on top. That reduces the chance of a big bull trend day.<li>Yesterday’s rally was strong enough to make a big bear day unlikely.<li>Today will probably have at least one reversal and not be a big trend day.<li>Since today is Friday, weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>The bulls want the week to close above the open of the week. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<li>It is more likely that the week will close in middle third and have a bear body. That would increase the chance of more sideways trading next week.<li>While unlikely, the week will close near the low. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-Bull-Trending-Trading-Range-Day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-9.png\" alt=\"Emini Bull Trending Trading Range Day and developing trading range.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Emini likely in developing trading range.<li>There are 5 bull bars on the monthly chart and July will probably not be the sixth. Therefore, even if the Emini continues to rally, it will probably end the month below the open of the month.<li>Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar for today, and the bull trend has been strong. But, the big tail on top makes it a weak buy signal bar.<li>I have been saying for the past week that the Emini will probably be mostly sideways for a week or more after extreme buy climaxes on the daily and 60-minute chart. Therefore, traders should expect reversals every few days.<li>Today will probably open back above the 60-minute EMA. The Emini might have to oscillate around it for several day after being above it for 70 bars, which is an extreme buy climax.<li>Since a trading range is likely on the 60-minute and daily charts, traders should also expect disappointment. That reduces the chance that tomorrow will be a strong entry bar for the bulls.<li>When the daily chart is in a trading range, the 5-minute chart tends to spend more time in trading ranges. There should be at least one swing up and one swing down today and either can come first.<li>Everybody knows that the market has rallied for a long time without more than a 10% pullback. That is unusual. There should be a 15 – 20% pullback before the end of the year.<li>Mid-July through mid-October is a common time for corrections. Did it begin yesterday? In a bull trend, the odds are that every bear day will be followed by a new high. The bears need several strong bear days before traders will conclude that the 15% correction has begun.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 21 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>It will probably open back above the 60-minute EMA.<li>The streak of 70 consecutive bars above the EMA on the 60-minute charts was one of the most extreme buy climaxes on that chart in years. That increases the chance that the Emini will have to oscillate around it for several days.<li>While yesterday is a buy signal bar on the daily chart, it had a big tail on top. That reduces the chance of a big bull trend day.<li>Yesterday’s rally was strong enough to make a big bear day unlikely.<li>Today will probably have at least one reversal and not be a big trend day.<li>Since today is Friday, weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>The bulls want the week to close above the open of the week. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week.<li>It is more likely that the week will close in middle third and have a bear body. That would increase the chance of more sideways trading next week.<li>While unlikely, the week will close near the low. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-Bull-Trending-Trading-Range-Day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-9.png\" alt=\"Emini Bull Trending Trading Range Day and developing trading range.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bigger the breakout bar, the more it closes on its low, and the more bear follow-through bars, the more likely the breakout will lead to a measured move down.<li>Until there is a strong and credible breakout from this yearlong trading range, traders will bet on reversals.</ul><h2 id=\"4-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"5-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-streak-of-6-bull-bars-in-parabolic-wedge.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-11-1.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart has streak of 6 bull bars in parabolic wedge \"></a></figure><ul><li>July currently is a small bull bar trading at all-time highs.<li>The is a 3<sup>rd</sup>push up in a tight bull channel since the pandemic lows.

The last time we had 6 consecutive bull bars was in 2011. This increases the chance that July will close below the open of the month.<li>If there is a big bear bar closing near its low, it would increase the chance of 2-3 months of a sideways to down move.<li>However, because rally has been in a tight bull channel, bulls will buy the pullback, even if it is 20%.</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-reversing-up-from-bottom-of-bull-channel-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart reversing up from bottom of bull channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>The weekly bar was a small bull bar at a new high with a big tail below.<li>The tail below indicates bulls bought the test of last week’s low, but the small body indicates a loss of momentum.<li>Because the bar closed near its high, next week might gap up. If there is a small gap, it will probably close early in the week because small gaps usually close before the bar closes.<li>The top of the trend channel around 4500 is a magnet above.<li>The Emini has been in a small pullback trend since the pandemic low. This is a very strong bull trend.<li>A small pullback trend ends when there is a bigger pullback. The largest pullback since the trend started was in September, which was 10% and lasted 2 months.<li>A small pullback bull trend ends with a big pullback. It would then probably be 10 – 20% and last at least 2 – 3 months.<li>Traders should buy the pullback for a test of the highs. The Emini might then either resume the bull trend or reverse down and form a trading range.<li>A strong bull trend does not usually turn into a bear trend without first forming a trading range.<li>There is a larger measured move up target around 4967 using the pandemic low with the Sept 20 highs. There should be a 15 – 20% pullback before the Emini gets there.<li>There is another measured move target around 4654 using the height of the Nov 20 to Feb 21 move.<li>If the Emini reaches the top of the trend channel at around 4500, there is a 75% chance of a reversal down to at least the middle of the channel. The reversal down typically begins by the 5<sup>th</sup>bar with a high above the channel.<li>Traders continue to expect higher prices because every potential bear setup has failed.<li>Sometimes the bears give up and stop selling. This can lead to an acceleration up. That usually attracts profit taking.

This is therefore a weak bull setup.<li>If EURUSD trades higher next week, a minor reversal is more likely than a bull trend unless the bull breakout bar is strong, reversing many prior bars and closes near the highs.<li>The yearlong trading range will likely continue. EURUSD is near the bottom of the yearlong trading range and most breakout attempts fail.<li>Should the EURUSD break below the Mar 2021 and Nov 2020 lows, odds are it will reverse back into the trading range again.&nbsp;<li>The bears want a break below the neckline of the Head &amp; Shoulders top. The bigger the breakout bar, the more it closes on its low, and the more bear follow-through bars, the more likely the breakout will lead to a measured move down to the March 2020 low.<li>Until there is a strong and credible breakout from this yearlong trading range, traders will bet on reversals.</ul><h2 id=\"4-sampp500-emini-futures\">S&amp;P500 Emini futures</h2><h3 id=\"5-the-monthly-emini-chart\">The<em>Monthly</em>Emini chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-18-1.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart in parabolic wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>July currently is a doji with a small bull body and long tail above.<li>The past 6 months are a 3<sup>rd</sup>push up in a tight bull channel since the pandemic lows.

The last time we had 6 consecutive bull bars was in 2011. This increases the chance that July will close below the open of the month.<li>If July has a bear body on the monthly chart, then a 15 – 20% correction will likely be underway for the next 2 – 3 months.<li>Without that, traders will bet on higher prices in August.<li>Because the rally has been in a tight bull channel, bulls will buy the pullback, even if it is 20%.<li>There are 2 more trading weeks to go and the monthly bar can look very different at the end of the month.</ul><h3 id=\"6-the-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Weekly</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SP500-Emini-Weekly-Chart-Sell-Signal-Bar-in-Buy-Climax.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-18-2.jpg\" alt=\"SP500 Emini sell signal bar on weekly chart and in buy climax\"></a></figure><ul><li>The weekly bar broke to a new high but closed near the low.<li>The Small Pullback Bull Trend has lasted more than 60 bars, which is unusual and therefore unsustainable and climactic. It should end soon, and it would end with a pullback bigger than prior pullbacks.<li>Since this week closed as a bear bar, the bears need to close next week on another bear follow-through bar to make traders believe that a deeper pullback is beginning.<li>The bears need to break strongly below the trend line around 4260, which is also a test of the May 7 breakout point.<li>If the bears fail to break the trendline with 2 or more bear bars closing near their lows, the selloff will probably be a breakout test of the May 7 high. Traders will expect a new high.<li>Traders know that in a strong bull trend, reversals are more likely to fail and turn into bull flags.<li>The Emini has been in a small pullback trend since the pandemic low. This is a very strong bull trend.<li>A Small Pullback Trend ends when there is a bigger pullback. The largest pullback since the trend started was in September, which was 10% and lasted 2 months.<li>So, the strong trend eventually will end with a pullback that is 10 – 20% and lasts at least 2 – 3 months. A Small Pullback Bull Trend usually evolves into a trading range and not a bear trend so bulls will buy the pullback.<li>After a trading range, a resumption of the bull trend is more likely than a reversal into a bear trend.</ul><h3 id=\"7-the-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">The<em>Daily</em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SP500-Emini-Daily-Chart-Reversing-Down-but-Bears-Need-Follow-Through.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-18-3.jpg\" alt=\"SP500 Emini daily chart reversing down but bears need follow-through\"></a></figure><ul><li>The Emini tested the top of the expanding triangle and Friday closed as a big outside down bar after a small wedge top.<li>Friday broke below a minor trendline drawn from the June 18<sup>th</sup>with the July 8<sup>th</sup>lows.<li>The next target for the bears is around the 4240-4260 area where the lower expanding triangle trendline, the major trend line and 50EMA are located.&nbsp;<li>There is often a 5- to 10-bar trading range after a buy climax like the recent 11-bar bull microchannel.

This is after a big bear bar on Friday. However, yesterday closed above the middle of its range, increasing the chance of a further bounce today.<li>It is a weak buy signal bar for today. That means there might be more sellers than buyers not far above its high.<li>The bulls want the selloff to be like all of the others over the past year. There have been many sharp selloffs, but each one led to resumption of the bull trend.<li>The selloff came after a streak of 11 consecutive days in a rally without a pullback, which was an extreme buy climax. The streak ended on July 6.<li>I said many times over the past 3 weeks that a streak like that increased the chance of sideways to down trading for several weeks, and it could lead to a correction.<li>We have had the sideways to down trading for a few weeks, but need more information before deciding if the selloff will grow into a correction. More information means more bars.<li>Gap down on weekly chart, triggering weekly sell signal.<li>I have written several times over the past month that July should be a bear bar on the monthly chart. This is because a bull bar in July would be the 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar, and there have not been 6 consecutive bull bars in 10 years. Therefore, it would probably not happen now.<li>Furthermore, I have been saying that if July is a bear bar, there would probably be a 2- to 3-month selloff of 15 – 20%.<li>10% correction = 3946, 15% = 3727, 20% = 3507.50, close of 2020 = 3729.25. Market usually will test close of last year at some point after 1<sup>st</sup>quarter.<li>A couple consecutive bull days will shift the odds back in favor of the the bull trend resuming.<li>Traders would then see yesterday as simply a Breakout Test of the May 7/June 1 double top, the 50-day MA, and the bull trend line.<li>If today is a bull day, traders will need to see if the bear trend resumes on Wednesday.<li>If the Emini is early in a bear trend on the daily chart, traders will sell 1- to 3-day rallies, even if they are strong. This is the opposite of the past year when the Emini was in a bull trend. I kept saying that traders would buy 1- to 3-day selloffs, even when they were strong. They might buy this one as well.<li>What is likely today? The selloff has been extreme and therefore exhaustive. The Emini should stop going down for a few days.<li>Also, even if the selloff continues down for 20%, it will probably lead to a trading range for a couple months.<li>Trading ranges disappoint bulls and bears. Follow-through is typically bad. Therefore, today will probably disappoint the bears who want a bear trend. That means today will probably not be a strong bear day.<li>Traders will need to see what happens over the next few days before deciding if the selloff is the start of a 15% correction or just a sharp pullback in the bull trend. That uncertainty increases the chance of a 1- or 2-day bounce and then sideways trading for a few days.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 8 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday reversed up from the 50-day MA, the breakout point on the daily chart, and the bottom of the bull channel. The bulls hope it is the end of the 3-day pullback.<li>Might gap up today, which would create 1-day island bottom. Island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns.<li>Should test magnets above. These are the open of the month, the 4300 Big Round Number, Friday’s low (top of gap), and a 50% pullback from the all-time high.<li>Bull want breakout above that resistance, but the Emini will more likely enter a trading range around the open of the month. It could last until the month ends next week, which is after next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement.<li>If the selloff is the start of a bear trend, the rally should end by midday tomorrow and the selloff should then resume. Confusion is more likely, which means a small trading range on the daily chart.<li>Today will probably not be an outside down day since yesterday’s range was fairly big and yesterday reversed up from major support on the daily chart.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-weak-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-20.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and weak bull trend reversal - possible Emini July reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is after a big bear bar on Friday. However, yesterday closed above the middle of its range, increasing the chance of a further bounce today.<li>It is a weak buy signal bar for today. That means there might be more sellers than buyers not far above its high.<li>The bulls want the selloff to be like all of the others over the past year. There have been many sharp selloffs, but each one led to resumption of the bull trend.<li>The selloff came after a streak of 11 consecutive days in a rally without a pullback, which was an extreme buy climax. The streak ended on July 6.<li>I said many times over the past 3 weeks that a streak like that increased the chance of sideways to down trading for several weeks, and it could lead to a correction.<li>We have had the sideways to down trading for a few weeks, but need more information before deciding if the selloff will grow into a correction. More information means more bars.<li>Gap down on weekly chart, triggering weekly sell signal.<li>I have written several times over the past month that July should be a bear bar on the monthly chart. This is because a bull bar in July would be the 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar, and there have not been 6 consecutive bull bars in 10 years. Therefore, it would probably not happen now.<li>Furthermore, I have been saying that if July is a bear bar, there would probably be a 2- to 3-month selloff of 15 – 20%.<li>10% correction = 3946, 15% = 3727, 20% = 3507.50, close of 2020 = 3729.25. Market usually will test close of last year at some point after 1<sup>st</sup>quarter.<li>A couple consecutive bull days will shift the odds back in favor of the the bull trend resuming.<li>Traders would then see yesterday as simply a Breakout Test of the May 7/June 1 double top, the 50-day MA, and the bull trend line.<li>If today is a bull day, traders will need to see if the bear trend resumes on Wednesday.<li>If the Emini is early in a bear trend on the daily chart, traders will sell 1- to 3-day rallies, even if they are strong. This is the opposite of the past year when the Emini was in a bull trend. I kept saying that traders would buy 1- to 3-day selloffs, even when they were strong. They might buy this one as well.<li>What is likely today? The selloff has been extreme and therefore exhaustive. The Emini should stop going down for a few days.<li>Also, even if the selloff continues down for 20%, it will probably lead to a trading range for a couple months.<li>Trading ranges disappoint bulls and bears. Follow-through is typically bad. Therefore, today will probably disappoint the bears who want a bear trend. That means today will probably not be a strong bear day.<li>Traders will need to see what happens over the next few days before deciding if the selloff is the start of a 15% correction or just a sharp pullback in the bull trend. That uncertainty increases the chance of a 1- or 2-day bounce and then sideways trading for a few days.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 8 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Yesterday reversed up from the 50-day MA, the breakout point on the daily chart, and the bottom of the bull channel. The bulls hope it is the end of the 3-day pullback.<li>Might gap up today, which would create 1-day island bottom. Island tops and bottoms are minor reversal patterns.<li>Should test magnets above. These are the open of the month, the 4300 Big Round Number, Friday’s low (top of gap), and a 50% pullback from the all-time high.<li>Bull want breakout above that resistance, but the Emini will more likely enter a trading range around the open of the month. It could last until the month ends next week, which is after next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement.<li>If the selloff is the start of a bear trend, the rally should end by midday tomorrow and the selloff should then resume. Confusion is more likely, which means a small trading range on the daily chart.<li>Today will probably not be an outside down day since yesterday’s range was fairly big and yesterday reversed up from major support on the daily chart.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-weak-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-20.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and weak bull trend reversal - possible Emini July reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.

Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-bear-channel-but-no-reversal-up.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-20-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex wedge bear channel but no reversal up\"></a></figure><ul><li>Forming 2<sup>nd</sup>consecutive wedge bottom, but no reversal up and there are magnets below.<li>Sideways and slightly down in July and now at apex of wedge so Breakout Mode.<li>Bears want break below July’s range and measured move down to below March low.<li>Bulls want test of top of range at June 25 high.<li>Bear trend since Late May and still forming minor lower highs and lows so lower prices are slightly more likely.<li>But, if bulls get a couple big bull days, odds will shift in favor of a rally up to the June high.<li>Reversing every few days and not moving far increases chance of more sideways to slightly down.<li>Since in Breakout Mode and at Apex of wedge, increased chance of breakout this week or next.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-small-pullback-bull-trend-from-the-open-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini small pullback bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Very strong Small Pullback Bull Trend for the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the day, and then entered a trading range.<li>Closed the gap below Friday’s low.<li>Broke back above open of month so July again has bull body.<li>Since July would be 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar on monthly chart and that has not happened in 10 years, probably will not happen this time.<li>Emini might get stuck around open of month for remainder of month, but today’s momentum up was strong enough for traders to expect higher prices this week.<li>Buy climax day on 5-minute chart so 75% chance tomorrow will have at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by end of 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.</ul><p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That increases the chance of at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up after the 1<sup>st</sup>pullback.<li>There is now a 50% chance of a new high. That means that there is still a 50% chance of a lower high.<li>A lower high would lead either to a bear trend or a trading range. A trading range is always at least slightly more likely.<li>What happens if there is a new high next week? The bulls want the bull trend to continue forever. That is not going to happen.<li>The next reasonable targets are the measured move up from the 3-month trading range at 4,404, the top of the bull channel at around 4,500, and the measured move up based on the height of the pandemic crash at 4,537.<li>The Emini has been sideways in July. Trading ranges resist breaking out. Therefore, there might be more sellers than buyers at the new high, which would be a break above the trading range.<li>I have been saying that July will probably have a bear body on the monthly chart when July closes next Friday. It could make a new high and then sell off to below the open of the month before the month ends next Friday.<li>The more the reversal up continues, the more likely the bulls will get a 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar on the monthly chart. That has not happened in 10 years. Therefore, a 7<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar will be even more unlikely, which means August would then probably have a bear body.<li>While it is less likely after the 2-day rally, the bears still have better than a 50% chance of creating a bear body in July.

Trends tend to weaken as they progress. Yesterday was also a bull trend, but it was in a bull channel, which is a weaker trend.<li>A bull channel usually behaves like a bear flag in that a breakout is more likely to be below the channel than above.<li>That increases the chance of a swing down today, which would break below yesterday’s bull trend line.<li>A bull channel typically evolves into a trading range. The market usually has to go sideways at least 10 – 20 bars before the bears can get a trend reversal.<li>Even if there is a trading range today, the odds are still greater that the 2-day bull trend will resume for at least one more leg sideways to up than it is that it will reverse.<li>So what should traders expect for today? While a trend up or down can always happen, the loss of momentum yesterday increases the chance of at least a couple hours of trading range trading today. Also, today will probably be sideways or down after 2 big bull days in a month-long trading range.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-bull-channel-4.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-22.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel.

That increases the chance of at least a small 2<sup>nd</sup>leg sideways to up after the 1<sup>st</sup>pullback.<li>There is now a 50% chance of a new high. That means that there is still a 50% chance of a lower high.<li>A lower high would lead either to a bear trend or a trading range. A trading range is always at least slightly more likely.<li>What happens if there is a new high next week? The bulls want the bull trend to continue forever. That is not going to happen.<li>The next reasonable targets are the measured move up from the 3-month trading range at 4,404, the top of the bull channel at around 4,500, and the measured move up based on the height of the pandemic crash at 4,537.<li>The Emini has been sideways in July. Trading ranges resist breaking out. Therefore, there might be more sellers than buyers at the new high, which would be a break above the trading range.<li>I have been saying that July will probably have a bear body on the monthly chart when July closes next Friday. It could make a new high and then sell off to below the open of the month before the month ends next Friday.<li>The more the reversal up continues, the more likely the bulls will get a 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar on the monthly chart. That has not happened in 10 years. Therefore, a 7<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar will be even more unlikely, which means August would then probably have a bear body.<li>While it is less likely after the 2-day rally, the bears still have better than a 50% chance of creating a bear body in July. The Emini is not too far above the open at the moment. Also, next Wednesday’s FOMC announcement is a catalyst. It could lead to a big move up or down, and that means there is the potential for a move down below the open.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is unchanged in the overnight Globex session.<li>Monday was a strong bull trend. Trends tend to weaken as they progress. Yesterday was also a bull trend, but it was in a bull channel, which is a weaker trend.<li>A bull channel usually behaves like a bear flag in that a breakout is more likely to be below the channel than above.<li>That increases the chance of a swing down today, which would break below yesterday’s bull trend line.<li>A bull channel typically evolves into a trading range. The market usually has to go sideways at least 10 – 20 bars before the bears can get a trend reversal.<li>Even if there is a trading range today, the odds are still greater that the 2-day bull trend will resume for at least one more leg sideways to up than it is that it will reverse.<li>So what should traders expect for today? While a trend up or down can always happen, the loss of momentum yesterday increases the chance of at least a couple hours of trading range trading today. Also, today will probably be sideways or down after 2 big bull days in a month-long trading range.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-bull-channel-4.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-22.png\" alt=\"Emini bull channel.

I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/EURUSD-Forex-weak-wedge-bottom-in-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-22-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weak wedge bottom in bear channel\"></a></figure><ul><li>Consecutive wedge bottoms since June 18. That increases the odds of a break above the month-long bear trend line and then a rally up to the July 9 lower high. The rally could reach the June 25 high over the next few weeks.<li>Today triggered buy signal, but so far is a small bear day. It has been a trading range day on the 5-minute chart.<li>A buy signal in a tight bear channel is low probability. Many bulls will wait to buy until they see a couple big bull bars or a breakout above the EMA.<li>Until then, odds favor at least slightly lower prices.<li>Sideways for 4 days, which increases the chance of more sideways, possibly until Wednesday’s FOMC.<li>If today closes near its low, it will be a Low 1 sell signal bar for tomorrow. But after 4 sideways days and consecutive wedges, it would be a weak signal, just like yesterday was a weak buy signal. That means sideways is more likely than up or down.<li>The bears want the month-long tight bear channel to continue to below the March low, which is also a measured move target. Because of the wedge bottom, they would like a collapse below the bottom of the bear channel to below that March low.</ul><h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-higher-low-double-bottom-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini higher low double bottom major trend reversal\"></a></figure><h3>End of day summary</h3><ul><li>Trading range day for the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the day.<li>Strong rally at midday from a higher low double bottom with yesterday’s strong rally.<li>Closed on the high so possible gap up tomorrow.<li>Only 20 points below all-time high so might make new high tomorrow.<li>If so, then this week will be outside up week.

It also broke above the 4,400 Big Round Number.<li>The next target for the bulls is the top of the channel, which is above the 4,500 Big Round Number.<li>There is no sign of a top and traders will continue to buy 1- to 3-day selloffs, even if they are strong, like the one last week.<li>A reversal down from here would be from an expanding triangle top on the daily chart. That is a major trend reversal pattern. If there was a strong sell signal bar and a couple big bear bars, the reversal would have a 40% chance of leading to a selloff for a couple weeks.<li>On the weekly chart, last week was an outside up week in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That slightly increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices.<li>However, a big bull bar late in a bull trend has an increased risk of leading to a bear bar on the following week.<li>On the monthly chart, July so far is the 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar. That has not happened in 10 years.<li>This is the final week of July. While it is possible that there could be a reversal down to below the open of the month, especially since Wednesday’s FOMC announcement is a potential catalyst, it is more likely that July will be another bull bar.<li>A 7<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar would be even more rare. Consequently, August should close below the open of the month.<li>Once there is a bear bar on the monthly chart, there would be a parabolic wedge top. Traders would then look for a 15-20% correction over the following 2 months.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 11 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>While the 4-day rally was extremely strong on the 5-minute and 60-minute charts, it was probably unsustainably strong. That increases the chance of sideways to down trading, which could last up to Wednesday’s FOMC announcement or the end of the month on Friday.<li>It also reduces the chance of a big bull day today.<li>Friday was a buy climax day. Consequently, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading beginning by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup>hour.</ul><h3>Friday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-high-2-bull-flag-then-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-26.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bull flag then bull trend from the open after outside up week.\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. Buyers of both the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter. These therefore are swing entries.<p class=\"caption\">It is important to understand that most swing setups do not lead to swing trades. As soon as traders are disappointed, many exit. Those who exit prefer to get out with a small profit (scalp), but often have to exit with a small loss.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><h3>EURUSD Forex daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/EURUSD-Forex-wedge-bottom-but-no-clear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-26-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><ul><li>Today went above Friday’s high, which triggered a buy signal for consecutive wedges, and for a higher low micro double bottom with the July 21 low.<li>It is important that today’s low stayed above the July 21 low, which is the current bottom of the wedge.

That is a major trend reversal pattern.<li>When the context and sell signal bar are good, there is a 40% chance of a swing down and a 30% chance of a bear trend.<li>Here, Monday was the sell signal bar and it was a bull bar. That is a bad sell signal bar.<li>Also, this is the 1<sup>st</sup>reversal down after 5 bull days. That is bad context.<li>Finally, yesterday closed above its middle, and it was therefore a weak entry bar.<li>So far, this a weak reversal attempt. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they will have a 40% chance of more than a 3-day pullback.<li>Yesterday is a High 1 buy signal bar, but it had a bear body. That is a low probability buy signal.<li>Not a good buy signal and not a good reversal down increases the chance of more sideways.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is up 6 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>There is an FOMC announcement today at 11 am PT. Day traders should exit their positions ahead of the report.<li>There is usually a big, fast move in both directions in the 1<sup>st</sup>few minutes after the report. Therefore, day traders should wait at least 10 minutes before resuming trading.<li>Day traders should be open to anything after the report. There can be a trend in either direction, and it can be strong or weak. There also can be a trend reversal. Least likely is that there will be no significant reaction and the Emini will enter a trading range.<li>Traders should trade today as if there are 2 separate sessions.

Yesterday was a reversal day because it closed near the low. However, it had a bull body and it is therefore a lower probability sell signal bar. Now 6th consecutive bull bar on monthly chart.<li>If the bears get a reversal down from here, the context would be good. This is because it would be from a micro double top with Monday’s high and an expanding triangle top (July 7 and July 14 were the 1<sup>st</sup>2 highs). Also, it would be from just below the trend channel line created with the May 7 and July 14 highs.<li>Because the daily chart is in a strong bull trend, it continues to break above resistance. Traders will keep betting that every 1- to 3-day selloff will lead to a new high until there is a strong reversal down.<li>Today is the final trading day in July. July has a big bull body and it should still have a bull body when the month closes today because the open of the month is 100 points down. That is probably too far to reach in one day.<li>The bull body would make at least slightly higher prices likely in August.<li>This is the 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive month with a bull body on the monthly chart. That has not happened in 10 years.<li>Since a 7<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar would be even more rare, August should have a bear body. That means August should close below the open of the month. This is true even it it rallies strongly for several weeks.<li>If August has a bear body, there would be a parabolic wedge on the monthly chart. That should lead to a 15 to 20% correction over the following month or two.<li>Most bars on all charts have conspicuous tails on the top and bottom. July is currently at the high of the month. That increases the chance that it will finish the month at least 30 – 50 points below the high of the month.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 30 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Today will have a big gap down open. That reduces the chance of a Bear Trend From The Open.<li>The bulls want a Bull Trend From The Open, but what usually happens after a big gap up or down is the market enters a trading range for an hour or two. Once it gets near the EMA, the bulls will try to rally from a double bottom or wedge bottom within the range. The bears will try to resume the bear trend from a double top or wedge top near the EMA.<li>Weak sell signal bar yesterday on daily chart, but context is good for the bears (micro double top, expanding triangle, top of bull channel).<li>Because today is the last day of the week and of the month, weekly and monthly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>The most important weekly magnets are the open of the week and last week’s high.

Yesterday was a reversal day because it closed near the low. However, it had a bull body and it is therefore a lower probability sell signal bar. Now 6th consecutive bull bar on monthly chart.<li>If the bears get a reversal down from here, the context would be good. This is because it would be from a micro double top with Monday’s high and an expanding triangle top (July 7 and July 14 were the 1<sup>st</sup>2 highs). Also, it would be from just below the trend channel line created with the May 7 and July 14 highs.<li>Because the daily chart is in a strong bull trend, it continues to break above resistance. Traders will keep betting that every 1- to 3-day selloff will lead to a new high until there is a strong reversal down.<li>Today is the final trading day in July. July has a big bull body and it should still have a bull body when the month closes today because the open of the month is 100 points down. That is probably too far to reach in one day.<li>The bull body would make at least slightly higher prices likely in August.<li>This is the 6<sup>th</sup>consecutive month with a bull body on the monthly chart. That has not happened in 10 years.<li>Since a 7<sup>th</sup>consecutive bull bar would be even more rare, August should have a bear body. That means August should close below the open of the month. This is true even it it rallies strongly for several weeks.<li>If August has a bear body, there would be a parabolic wedge on the monthly chart. That should lead to a 15 to 20% correction over the following month or two.<li>Most bars on all charts have conspicuous tails on the top and bottom. July is currently at the high of the month. That increases the chance that it will finish the month at least 30 – 50 points below the high of the month.</ul><h3>Emini 5-minute chart and what to expect today</h3><ul><li>Emini is down 30 points in the overnight Globex session.<li>Today will have a big gap down open. That reduces the chance of a Bear Trend From The Open.<li>The bulls want a Bull Trend From The Open, but what usually happens after a big gap up or down is the market enters a trading range for an hour or two. Once it gets near the EMA, the bulls will try to rally from a double bottom or wedge bottom within the range. The bears will try to resume the bear trend from a double top or wedge top near the EMA.<li>Weak sell signal bar yesterday on daily chart, but context is good for the bears (micro double top, expanding triangle, top of bull channel).<li>Because today is the last day of the week and of the month, weekly and monthly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour.<li>The most important weekly magnets are the open of the week and last week’s high. The bulls want a bull bar and a close above last week’s high. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<li>Today will probably gap below the open of the week. If this week has a bear body, it will increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices next week.<li>The bigger the bear body and the more the week closes on its low, the more likely next week will trade below this week’s low.<li>There is no nearby monthly support or resistance. The open of the month is more than 100 points below and therefore very unlikely to be a factor.</ul><h3>Yesterday’s Emini setups</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-then-bear-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2021-7-30.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open then bear trend reversal.
