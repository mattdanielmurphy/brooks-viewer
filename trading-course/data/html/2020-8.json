It has paused for a couple weeks in the February gap. Traders are deciding whether the rally will close the gap and continue to a new high, or reverse down and retrace half of the rally. The probability is slightly better for the bulls.<p>The<strong>bond futures</strong>market has rallied relentlessly on the weekly chart after a climactic reversal down in March. This increases the chance of a sudden acceleration up.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex chart has had its strongest 3 week rally in 8 years. It is overbought on the daily chart and at the resistance of the September 2018 high. There is a nested wedge buy climax on the daily chart. Traders expect a pullback lasting at least 2 weeks and falling at least 200 pips.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures weekly chart:</strong><br>Weak but persistent rally for 2 months</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-with-weak-breakout-of-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart with weak breakout of trading range\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures market is relentlessly marching up in a 9 week bull micro channel. While the price increase has not been dramatic, the bulls are winning every week on the weekly chart. They keep getting a high above the prior week’s high and a low above the prior week’s low. This makes higher prices likely.<p>I mentioned last week that a unimpressive bull trend that is relentless often suddenly breaks to the upside. Traders should not be surprised if this were to happen.<p>I have pointed out several times that the rally from the 2019 low has had 2 legs up and it has been climactic. Climactic rallies tend to have a 3rd leg up before they exhaust themselves. Consequently, even with the dramatic climactic reversal down in March, the bulls still have a 40% chance that the current 2 month rally will make a new high. If it does, traders should expect a reversal down from a 2 year wedge top.<p>Can the weekly chart reverse down next week? The 1st reversal down from a tight bull channel is typically minor. Therefore, the best the bears can probably get is a minor reversal down. That means a 1 – 2 week pullback. They will likely need at least a micro double top before they can reverse this 9 week rally.<h2><strong>EURUSD Forex weekly chart:</strong><br>Strongest 3 week rally in 8 years, but nested wedge buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-with-weak-breakout-to-52-week-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-1-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart with weak breakout to 52 week high\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex weekly chart this week formed its 3rd consecutive big bull bar. This is the strongest 3 week rally on the weekly chart since 2012.<p>For over a year, I have been saying that the September 2018 high was a magnet and therefore resistance. That was the start of the 2 year bear channel that began after the spike down in early 2018.<p>When there is a break above a bear channel, the rally usually tests the start of the channel. That is what is happening now with the test of the September 2018 high. The chart then often converts into a trading range.<p>But with this 3 week rally as strong as it has been, the downside risk is small over the next couple of weeks. The bears will need at least a micro double top before there is more than a 1 – 2 week pullback. A micro double top typically takes at least 2 – 3 bars (weeks) to form. Therefore, the EURUSD will probably be sideways next week on the weekly chart.<h3>Wedge rally to a double top could lead to a deeper selloff</h3><p>I said that the 1st reversal down might only last a couple weeks. But if there is then a brief rally back up to test the September 2018 high again, there would be a potential micro double top with this week’s high.<p>It is important to look at the entire chart. Remember, the 3 legs up from the March low is a wedge rally. That is a type of buy climax. It is testing the important September 2018 high. There is therefore the potential for a big double top.<p>The 2nd leg up in a double top often is a wedge. That increases the chance of a reversal down. A reversal down from a wedge often has about half as many bars as there were in the wedge. Although the 1st leg down might only be a couple weeks, there is a 40% chance that the EURUSD will soon begin a 2 month swing down.<p>If it does, it will probably fall below breakout points. Those are the March 9 and the June 10 highs. It could also drop down to the bottom of the most recent buy climax within a couple months. That is the June 19 low of 1.1168.<p>Traders will know within a few weeks if the EURUSD will simply pause and the continue up or begin a test down to the breakout points. As strong as the 3 week rally has been, traders should expect the EURUSD to be lower a month or two from now.<h3>Next target for the bulls is the 2018 high around 1.25</h3><p>Can the rally continue up the the 2018 high? It might next year, but the current rally is so extreme that it will attract profit takers within a few weeks. That should result in at least a 1 – 2 week initial pullback of about 200 pips. The pullback will probably start next week. However, after such a strong rally, traders will buy the pullback. But, as I said above, if there is then a 2nd reversal down, the selloff could be deeper and last longer.<h3>The bulls need follow-through buying in August on the EURUSD monthly chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-with-breakout-to-52-week-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-1-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart with breakout to 52 week high\"></a></figure><p>July was a big bull trend bar on the monthly chart. It broke above a 2 year bear channel. When there is a breakout, traders want confirmation. The bulls want August to have a bull body on the monthly chart. If it does, that would increase the chance of higher prices in September.<p>But if August closes near its low, then September will probably trade below the August low. The monthly chart might then evolve into a trading range for many months. That is what typically happens when there is a breakout above a bear channel.<p>If August closes somewhere in the middle of its range with either a small bull or bear body, traders will still expect at least slightly higher prices later in the year, but not necessarily in September.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-with-nested-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-1-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart with nested wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD daily chart has had a climactic rally for several weeks. It has had at least 3 small thrusts up and it is in a tight bull channel. This is a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>It is nested within a 4 month wedge bull channel. A nested wedge is more likely to attract profit taking.<p>Friday was a big bear reversal bar and it closed near its low. It is a sell signal bar for a blow-off top. Also, the bear bar from 3 days ago was a prior attempt to reverse. This current 2nd attempt therefore has a higher probability.<p>After an exhaustive buy climax, traders expect about 10 bars and 2 legs sideways to down before the bulls will buy aggressively again. A minimum pullback should be at least 2%, which is about 200 pips. It usually gets near the EMA. However, as I said above, the selloff could continue down over a couple months to the March 9 and June 10 highs.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong July means at least slightly higher prices in August</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-testing-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-1-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart testing all time high\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;had a huge reversal up from the 10 year bull trend line in March. It has rallied strongly for 4 months, almost completely erasing the pandemic crash.<p>I mentioned in June that the bodies had been shrinking for 3 months. That was a sign that the rally was losing momentum as it approached the top of the 3 year trading range. Also, June had a big tail on top. That is a sign of the bulls taking profits.<p>This combination made it likely that July would not get much above the June high. While that turned out to be true, July closed on its high and above the June high. This is a resumption of the momentum up.<p>That is a low probability outcome. When there is a bull surprise, there is usually at least some follow-through buying. This increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices in August.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>4 month island bottom if gap up next week</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-high-1-bull-flag-and-possible-island-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-1-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart high 1 bull flag and possible island bottom\"></a></figure><p>This week closed on its high, which is good for the bulls. It is a bull inside bar in a bull trend. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for next week. This increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>The bulls want the Emini to trigger the buy signal next week by going above this week’s high. They then want the rally to close the February gap. Since the top of the gap is just below the all-time high, if they close the gap, the will probably get a new all-time high soon afterwards.<h3>Possible 4 month island bottom</h3><p>Two of the past 4 weeks gapped up, but both gaps closed later in the day. With this week closing on its high, there is an increased chance of a gap up next week.<p>Since the Emini gapped down 4 months ago, a gap up would create a 4 month island bottom. If the gap is big, the odds of it staying open for at least a few weeks will go up. It would also increase the chance of a new all-time high within a few weeks.<p>Because the March crash was so severe, there are many traders shorting around the old high. A rally to a new high could create intense short covering. This could result in a surprisingly big breakout.<h3>Persistent rally but some weakness</h3><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since the March low. However, the 5th week up was a doji bar. Also, there have been several other dojis and bear bars since.<p>This is trading range price action. That increases the chance that the rally since that doji bar in April is only a bull leg in what will become a trading range.<p>There is no top yet and the momentum up at this point is strong enough so that traders think that a new high will come before there is pullback lasting more than a few days.<p>It is important to note that even though the week closed on its high, it did not go above last week’s high. Also, the 3 prior weeks had small bodies and big tails. Every tail is a reversal. These doji bars are a sign of balance and uncertainty. This gives the bears hope of a reversal down before there is a new high.<p>The Emini in the weekly chart has paused for 2 weeks in the February gap. Traders do not yet know if there will be enough sellers here to get a 1 – 2 month reversal down to the middle of the 3 year trading range. That is also the middle of the 4 month rally. They should find out within a couple weeks. At this point, the odds slightly favor a new high before a pullback.<h3>When will the bull trend end?</h3><p>As I said, there is no top yet and the Emini might rally to a new all-time high before there is a bear leg. However, a rally with lots of trading range price action typically eventually evolves into a trading range.<p>A conversion into a trading range would require a selloff lasting at least a few weeks. If it were to begin around the old high, the 1st downside target would be the 5 week trading range that ended in early July. That is a potential Final Bull Flag.<p>It is important to understand that the bear leg often falls all of the way down to that 1st doji where the trading range price action began. That is the April 21 low just above 2700.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Sideways for 2 weeks in February gap</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-small-pullback-bull-trend-tesing-Feruary-crash-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-1-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart small pullback bull trend tesing Feruary crash gap\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has had many big days up and down in July. It continues to oscillate in a tight range around the February 24 high. That is the bottom of the gap down on the daily and weekly charts at the start of the pandemic crash.<p>I have talked about that gap as an important magnet since it formed. Once the rally started to get near it in June, I said that traders would expect the Emini to enter the gap. I said most bears would not want to sell unless the Emini entered the gap and reversed down. It has entered the gap, but there has not yet been a credible top.<p>The Emini is testing the February gap and the all-time high. This is a very important price level. The past 3 days each had bull bodies and closed on its high. It is in a bull trend on the daily and weekly charts. On the monthly chart, July closed on its high and well above the June high. These factors make it more likely that the bulls will get their new all-time high in August before there is more than a 3 day pullback.<h3>Potential for surprisingly big breakout up or down</h3><p>The Emini is now back at the start of the Pandemic Crash. This is an emotional level.<p>Energy is building within the February gap. This increases the chance that one side or the other will get trapped. That can result in a very big breakout with sustained follow-through, and the move can be in either direction. We just don’t know at this point if the breakout will be up or down, and if the losing side will exit in a panic, creating a huge breakout.<p>The bulls got trapped by the crash in February and March. Many are afraid that there might be another selloff at this level. This could result in panic selling.<p>Yes, the bulls have momentum, but have you heard anyone say that people should sell here? This means that the longs are in a crowded trade. There might not be a lot of shorts to cover. We don’t know. But if the shorts won’t buy and the bulls are fully invested, who will buy at this price? This creates the potential for a big move down.<p>Also, there might be many bears selling here, betting on a double top. If so, they will get squeezed on a breakout to a new high. A short squeeze can lead to a big rally.<h3>Downside targets</h3><p>If there is a reversal down, it will probably retrace a third to a half of the 4 month rally. Big round numbers are important. The most significant ones here are 3000, 2800, and 2700. The reason why 3000 is important is that it is a multiple of 1,000 and not just 100. There is a potential Final Bull Flag around 2800. Finally, 2700 is approximately a 50% pullback of the 4 month rally.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Both gaps quickly closed, but there briefly was a 4 month island bottom both times. I said that the Emini might try again this week.<p>If today gaps up and the gap remains open, there will be a gap up on the weekly chart as well as on the daily chart. There would then be a 4 month island bottom. If the bulls can keep the gap open for a few days, they will probably get a new all-time high this month.<p>Once there is an island bottom, there is an increased chance of a gap down and an island top at some point afterwards. Therefore, even if the bulls get their new high this month, traders will not be surprised if it fails within a few weeks with a gap down and an island top. Island tops and bottoms are usually not major patterns.<p>July had a big bull body on the monthly chart and it closed above the June high. After the Emini lost momentum on the monthly chart in June, it regained the momentum in July. This increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices in August.<p>With the persistence of the bulls in their attempts to create a weekly island bottom, a 3rd attempt will probably be successful this week. That increases the chance of a bull trend day today. A breakout often goes sideways for 2 or 3 days before going a lot higher. Therefore, if today is a bull trend day, it might not be a big bull day.<p>Can today’s gap fail, like the 2 attempts in August? Sure, but with this persistence, it will more likely succeed. It will probably stay open for at least a couple weeks and maybe much longer. The odds favor higher prices.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up on the weekly chart and gap above the July high. Since this is the 3rd attempt in 4 weeks at a weekly island bottom, there is an increased chance of a bull trend today.<p>When there is a bull trend day after a gap up, the bull trend often is not very strong. This is because the Emini has already rallied overnight by creating the gap. Therefore, if there is a bull trend today, it will probably be either a Trending Trading Range Day or a Broad Bull Channel day and not a Small Pullback Bull Trend Day.<p>The chance of a 3rd weekly gap up in 4 weeks failing is less than if this was the 1st or 2nd attempt. The odds are against it, and therefore today will probably not be a bear trend day. Traders should expect either a trading range day or a bull trend day. With Friday being so climactic, there will probably be at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There was a parabolic wedge rally over the past several weeks and it was nested within a 4 month wedge rally.<p>I wrote last week that traders expect profit taking and at least a couple weeks of sideways to down trading. The obvious targets are the support at the EMA and the breakout point, which is the March 9 high. The profit taking could continue for a month and test the June 19 low. That is the start of the final leg up in the wedge, which is often a target after a wedge top.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight. There has been a couple legs down with most of the trading being sideways.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways of a couple hours. This is probably the start of a pullback on the daily chart that will last at least a couple of weeks. Consequently, the bulls who have not yet taken profits will sell on rallies. Also, the bears know that the bulls will be more interested in selling rallies than buying. They too will sell rallies.<p>This should result in at least a couple weeks of sideways to down trading. There will be some strong bull trend day along the way, but the EURUSD should work lower.<p>Can today’s selloff reverse back up to the high? Yes, as I said, there will be bull days, which will form High 1 buy signal bars on the daily chart. But, the bulls will probably not be able to form more than a 2 – 3 day weak rally for at least a couple weeks. Day traders expect that there will be more opportunities to sell than buy.<p>Since the EURUSD has spent so much time in trading ranges overnight, traders are both buying and selling. They have been mostly looking for scalps.<p>Because the daily chart has been up so strongly, the bulls might be able to get today to close back above the midpoint of the day’s range. But, today will probably not reverse back up to the open.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-double-bottom-and-wedge-bottom-at-EMA-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and wedge bottom at EMA then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, the gap up on the weekly chart created a 4 month island bottom with the February gap down. Also, there is now a gap up on the monthly chart, which is rare.<p>When there is any big breakout above important resistance, the market often will go sideways for a few bars. Few bars on what time frame? All! There is an increased chance of a few sideways bars on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<p>However, all 3 are in bull trends and traders expect higher prices. The odds of a new high are going up, but there is still a 40% chance of a reversal down from a double top with the February high.<p>Because more often than not, a gap up leads to at least a couple sideways bars, tomorrow has an increased chance of having a lot of overlap with today. This is especially true with so much trading range price action today.<p>But the Emini is at a critical price.

Both gaps quickly closed, but there briefly was a 4 month island bottom both times. I said that the Emini might try again this week.<p>If today gaps up and the gap remains open, there will be a gap up on the weekly chart as well as on the daily chart. There would then be a 4 month island bottom. If the bulls can keep the gap open for a few days, they will probably get a new all-time high this month.<p>Once there is an island bottom, there is an increased chance of a gap down and an island top at some point afterwards. Therefore, even if the bulls get their new high this month, traders will not be surprised if it fails within a few weeks with a gap down and an island top. Island tops and bottoms are usually not major patterns.<p>July had a big bull body on the monthly chart and it closed above the June high. After the Emini lost momentum on the monthly chart in June, it regained the momentum in July. This increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices in August.<p>With the persistence of the bulls in their attempts to create a weekly island bottom, a 3rd attempt will probably be successful this week. That increases the chance of a bull trend day today. A breakout often goes sideways for 2 or 3 days before going a lot higher. Therefore, if today is a bull trend day, it might not be a big bull day.<p>Can today’s gap fail, like the 2 attempts in August? Sure, but with this persistence, it will more likely succeed. It will probably stay open for at least a couple weeks and maybe much longer. The odds favor higher prices.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 20 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up on the weekly chart and gap above the July high. Since this is the 3rd attempt in 4 weeks at a weekly island bottom, there is an increased chance of a bull trend today.<p>When there is a bull trend day after a gap up, the bull trend often is not very strong. This is because the Emini has already rallied overnight by creating the gap. Therefore, if there is a bull trend today, it will probably be either a Trending Trading Range Day or a Broad Bull Channel day and not a Small Pullback Bull Trend Day.<p>The chance of a 3rd weekly gap up in 4 weeks failing is less than if this was the 1st or 2nd attempt. The odds are against it, and therefore today will probably not be a bear trend day. Traders should expect either a trading range day or a bull trend day. With Friday being so climactic, there will probably be at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-3.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There was a parabolic wedge rally over the past several weeks and it was nested within a 4 month wedge rally.<p>I wrote last week that traders expect profit taking and at least a couple weeks of sideways to down trading. The obvious targets are the support at the EMA and the breakout point, which is the March 9 high. The profit taking could continue for a month and test the June 19 low. That is the start of the final leg up in the wedge, which is often a target after a wedge top.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight. There has been a couple legs down with most of the trading being sideways.<p>The EURUSD has been sideways of a couple hours. This is probably the start of a pullback on the daily chart that will last at least a couple of weeks. Consequently, the bulls who have not yet taken profits will sell on rallies. Also, the bears know that the bulls will be more interested in selling rallies than buying. They too will sell rallies.<p>This should result in at least a couple weeks of sideways to down trading. There will be some strong bull trend day along the way, but the EURUSD should work lower.<p>Can today’s selloff reverse back up to the high? Yes, as I said, there will be bull days, which will form High 1 buy signal bars on the daily chart. But, the bulls will probably not be able to form more than a 2 – 3 day weak rally for at least a couple weeks. Day traders expect that there will be more opportunities to sell than buy.<p>Since the EURUSD has spent so much time in trading ranges overnight, traders are both buying and selling. They have been mostly looking for scalps.<p>Because the daily chart has been up so strongly, the bulls might be able to get today to close back above the midpoint of the day’s range. But, today will probably not reverse back up to the open.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-double-bottom-and-wedge-bottom-at-EMA-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-3-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and wedge bottom at EMA then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

However, the gap up on the weekly chart created a 4 month island bottom with the February gap down. Also, there is now a gap up on the monthly chart, which is rare.<p>When there is any big breakout above important resistance, the market often will go sideways for a few bars. Few bars on what time frame? All! There is an increased chance of a few sideways bars on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts.<p>However, all 3 are in bull trends and traders expect higher prices. The odds of a new high are going up, but there is still a 40% chance of a reversal down from a double top with the February high.<p>Because more often than not, a gap up leads to at least a couple sideways bars, tomorrow has an increased chance of having a lot of overlap with today. This is especially true with so much trading range price action today.<p>But the Emini is at a critical price.

There was also a gap up on the weekly and monthly charts as well. Gaps on the monthly chart are rare. Since there was a gap down in February on the weekly chart, there is now a 4 month island bottom.<p>When there is a breakout and gap up on the daily chart, the Emini usually goes sideways for 2 – 3 days. Yesterday was a trading range day. That also increases the chance of more trading range trading today.<p>If the Emini goes sideways for a couple days, traders then decide if the breakout will lead to a trend up or if there will be a reversal down. This means there is an increased chance of another sideways day today.<p>However, the all-time high is a magnet above and the daily chart is in a bull trend. That increases the chance of follow-through buying at some point this week.<h3>The importance of the gap on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts</h3><p>The key for the bulls will be keeping the gap open on the weekly and monthly charts. They therefore will buy a breakout below yesterday’s low and they will try to get a reversal up from above last week’s high.<p>Since 2 and 3 day island tops are more common than 1 day island tops, the bulls will likely get a reversal up from below yesterday’s low and from above last week’s high. Can today be a big bull trend day? Yes, but the Emini more often has at least a couple sideways days after an important gap up. A gap up on the weekly and monthly charts is important.<p>What happens if the Emini closes the gap? That would increase the chance of a double top with the February high. If there is follow-through selling for a day or two, the odds of a pullback to below 3000 would go back up to 50%.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 14 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap below yesterday’s low. If so, yesterday will be a 1 day island top. Island tops and bottoms are minor patterns and small gaps usually fill early in the day.<p>As I wrote above, the Emini will probably have another mostly sideways day today. But if it closes the gap, the bulls will be disappointed. There would then be a better chance of a big bear day.<p>Yesterday’s range was small and there will probably be buyers in the gap. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a move below yesterday’s low and then a reversal up to above yesterday’s high.<p>Today would then be an outside up bull trend day. But since a 2nd sideways day is likely, today will probably not be a strong bull trend day, even if it is outside up.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-double-bottom-and-wedge-bottom-at-EMA-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-4.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and wedge bottom at EMA then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. But it was a bear doji and it followed a strong bear reversal bar. This is a weak buy setup.<p>Furthermore, the rally is a nested wedge buy climax at major resistance. It is more likely that the EURUSD is beginning a 2 week profit taking pullback to around the EMA and the March 9 high breakout point. Traders expect more sellers above yesterday’s high and last week’s high than buyers.<p>Traders know that the selloff on the daily chart will probably not be a strong reversal down. They therefore are not expecting a series of big bear days. In fact, after the strongest rally in three years, the EURUSD might enter a tight trading range for a week or two. At that point, traders would decide whether to resume the bull trend or continue down to test the breakout points at the September 9 and March 10 highs.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market triggered a buy signal overnight on the daily chart by going above yesterday’s high. But instead of buying the breakout above yesterday’s high, traders sold it. This makes sense since the bulls are probably looking to take profits. The EURUSD barely went above yesterday’s high and then reversed down over the past 3 hours.<p>Because traders expect the EURUSD to work sideways to down for a couple weeks, traders will look to sell rallies. After the 50 pip selloff over the past 3 hours, they will sell 20 – 30 pip rallies today.<p>However, since they know that a tight trading range is likely for a week or so, they will also look to buy reversals up. In addition, they expect a lot of trading range trading.<p>Therefore, despite a 50 pip selloff in a tight bear channel over the past 3 hours, they are looking for mostly sideways trading for the rest of the day. Their default will be to scalp for 10 – 20 pips unless there is a strong swing setup or a strong breakout up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-trading-range-with-bear-trap-and-bull-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with bear trap and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

There was a late bear breakout of a 4 hour trading range. However, it was a bear trap and a test of the bottom of the 2 day range. The Emini reversed up to a new high and to the 3300 Big Round Number.<p>The top of the February gap is only 7 points above today’s close and the bulls will try to get there tomorrow. With today closing on its high and the magnet nearby, tomorrow might gap above the top of the February gap. Traders are expecting a new all-time high within a couple weeks.<p>There is still a 40% chance of a reversal down to below 3000 before there is a new high. However, the bears need to begin the reversal this week because the Emini is so close to the old high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The Emini reversed up to a new high and to the 3300 Big Round Number.<p>The top of the February gap is only 7 points above today’s close and the bulls will try to get there tomorrow. With today closing on its high and the magnet nearby, tomorrow might gap above the top of the February gap. Traders are expecting a new all-time high within a couple weeks.<p>There is still a 40% chance of a reversal down to below 3000 before there is a new high. However, the bears need to begin the reversal this week because the Emini is so close to the old high.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders expect at least slightly higher prices. With yesterday closing on its high and with the top of the February gap just 6 points above yesterday’s high, the Emini might gap above that target today.<p>Even if it does not, traders expect the gap to close this week. Furthermore, the Emini will probably make a new high within a couple weeks. There is only a 40% chance of more than a 3 day pullback before there is a new high.<p>Can today sell off and close the gap above Friday’s high? The bears have a 20% chance at the moment. More likely, there will be buyers below yesterday’s low and the bulls will try to close the gap above the February 24 high. Therefore the risk of a big bear day is small. Day traders expect either another sideways day or a bull trend day today.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 18 points in the Globex session. If it opens here, there will be a gap up. More importantly, it will have closed the big February gap down on the daily and weekly charts. That would make a new high likely within a week or two.<p>Yesterday ended with a very strong rally. A protracted rally in a tight bull channel is a buy climax. It tends to attract profit takers. When a day ends with a buy climax, there is a 50% chance of some follow-through buying on the open of the next day. However, there is a 75% chance of at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<p>Because the bulls will probably achieve their goal of closing the gap on the weekly chart, some will take profits. This is especially true because the Emini is just below the resistance of the all-time high from February. If enough do, today could then trade down from above yesterday’s high to below its low. The bears have a 20% chance of an outside down day today.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-trading-range-with-bear-trap-and-bull-trend-reversal-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-5.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with bear trap and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

However, there was a strong sell signal bar last week and there is an extreme buy climax. Also, this is taking place at the resistance of the September 2018 high. Therefore, despite the strong bull trend, many bulls will take some profits soon.<p>If enough do, the EURUSD will pull back for a couple weeks to around the EMA and the March 9 high. While yesterday and today so far are good for the bulls, traders should expect that either the pullback began last week or it will begin after a brief new high, like on June 10.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied overnight and it is testing last week’s high. However, the rally has had 3 legs up in an bull channel. It is therefore a wedge, which is a type of buy climax.<p>Buy climaxes usually attract profit takers. While the bulls want the rally to continue to above last week’s high today, the wedge bull channel will probably evolve into a trading range within a couple hours.<p>So far, day traders have mostly only been buying for 20 pip scalps and a swing up. However, they will begin to sell reversals down from the intraday high for 10 – 20 pip scalps.<p>Can today continue up all day? Probably not because the range is already about average and last week’s high is resistance. Therefore either sideways trading or even a reversal down is more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-trading-range-day-after-closing-February-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day after closing February gap\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The lack of energy after the gap up above resistance increases the chance of a 1 – 2 day pullback into the February gap this week. Additionally, it increases the chance of another quiet day tomorrow.<p>But a small day also increases the chance of either a gap down, creating a 1 day island top, or an outside up or down day. However, unless there is a very strong reversal down, the bulls will keep buying pullbacks, like they have been doing for 5 months.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls are looking for a reason to take some profits. Closing the gap might do it.<p>But the 5 month rally tested many resistance levels and broke above every one. Therefore, if yesterday is the start of a selloff, it probably will only last 1 – 3 days. Traders believe there will be buyers in the gap above last week’s high. Furthermore, they think that this rally will make a new high before there is more than a 3 day pullback.<p>Yesterday was a small day in an overbought market on the daily chart. That lack of buying increases the chances of a profit taking pullback.<p>With yesterday closing around the open, it is a star doji and a credible sell signal bar for today. The Emini might have to test back into Monday’s gap to see if the bulls can keep the gap open.<p>Since yesterday had a small range, today could be an outside down or up day. Or, if today gaps down, there would be a one day island top. However, island tops and bottoms are typically minor reversal patterns.<h3>6 consecutive bull days is extreme</h3><p>While yesterday was a doji, it closed slightly above the open. It was therefore the 6th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart. Because that is getting unusual, it increases the chance of a bear bar today or tomorrow. That will make traders more willing to sell reversals down from above the open, expecting today to close below the open and finally form a bear body on the daily chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 1 point in the Globex market. It will therefore probably open within yesterday’s range. Since yesterday was a trading range and today will open in that range, there is an increased chance of a trading range again today.<p>However, with yesterday’s range being so small, there is an increased chance that today will trade both above and below yesterday’s range, becoming an outside day. Consequently, there might be seller’s above yesterday’s high and buyers below yesterday’s low.<p>Because this week’s gap up is important, it is a magnet below. That increases the chance of a bear trend down into that gap.<p>Also, whenever a market appears to be less likely to do something, it actually is more likely to do it. Everyone sees that the daily chart is overbought and therefore a pullback is likely.<p>But that increases the chance that the pullback traders are already positioned for a pullback. There might not be enough other traders will to sell. If this is true and the Emini does not go down, the bears will begin to buy and bulls who took profits will also buy. That increases the chance of a big bull trend day, despite an overbought market.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-trading-range-day-after-closing-February-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-6.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day after closing February gap\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is coming in a nested wedge buy climax.<p>This should attract profit taking and some shorting. Traders should expect a couple week pullback to around the EMA. It should also test the breakout point of the March 9 high. There is a 30% chance that it could last longer and fall down to the June 9 low.<p>The bulls hope that the pullback lasts only a few days. The rally from the June 19 low has been a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Every pullback ended after only 1 or 2 days. While that is possible again here, the pattern and the context make a deeper pullback more likely this time.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above last week’s high overnight and then reversed down. The bulls do not want a bear day closing on its low today because that would attract selling and increase the chance of a pullback. They want the trend to continue up indefinitely. Consequently, they will buy selloffs today. They would like today to close above the open so that today would have a bull body on the daily chart. That would increases the chance of another leg up to 1.20 before there is profit taking.<p>The bears want the EURUSD to go down to support on the daily chart. They will sell rallies and try to get today to close on its low. If they are successful, traders would expect lower prices for at least a couple days and possibly a couple weeks.<p>What is most likely? While the EURUSD has reversed down from above last week’s high, the selloff has not been particularly strong. It has traded sideways for a few hours around yesterday’s close. This increases the chance that today will continue sideways and either close around the open or near the low, but not far below the current low.<p>Can today reverse back up to above yesterday’s high? That is unlikely after already reversing down?<p>Can it break strongly to the downside and become a huge bear day? With it sideways for 5 hours, that also is unlikely. Day traders have been scalping for 5 hours and will continue to scalp unless there is a surprise breakout up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-outside-up-day-after-being-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day after being outside down day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The bulls are looking for a reason to take some profits. Closing the gap might do it.<p>But the 5 month rally tested many resistance levels and broke above every one. Therefore, if yesterday is the start of a selloff, it probably will only last 1 – 3 days. Traders believe there will be buyers in the gap above last week’s high. Furthermore, they think that this rally will make a new high before there is more than a 3 day pullback.<p>Yesterday was a small day in an overbought market on the daily chart. That lack of buying increases the chances of a profit taking pullback.<p>With yesterday closing around the open, it is a star doji and a credible sell signal bar for today. The Emini might have to test back into Monday’s gap to see if the bulls can keep the gap open.<p>Since yesterday had a small range, today could be an outside down or up day. Or, if today gaps down, there would be a one day island top. However, island tops and bottoms are typically minor reversal patterns.<h3>6 consecutive bull days is extreme</h3><p>While yesterday was a doji, it closed slightly above the open. It was therefore the 6th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart. Because that is getting unusual, it increases the chance of a bear bar today or tomorrow. That will make traders more willing to sell reversals down from above the open, expecting today to close below the open and finally form a bear body on the daily chart.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 1 point in the Globex market. It will therefore probably open within yesterday’s range. Since yesterday was a trading range and today will open in that range, there is an increased chance of a trading range again today.<p>However, with yesterday’s range being so small, there is an increased chance that today will trade both above and below yesterday’s range, becoming an outside day. Consequently, there might be seller’s above yesterday’s high and buyers below yesterday’s low.<p>Because this week’s gap up is important, it is a magnet below. That increases the chance of a bear trend down into that gap.<p>Also, whenever a market appears to be less likely to do something, it actually is more likely to do it. Everyone sees that the daily chart is overbought and therefore a pullback is likely.<p>But that increases the chance that the pullback traders are already positioned for a pullback. There might not be enough other traders will to sell. If this is true and the Emini does not go down, the bears will begin to buy and bulls who took profits will also buy. That increases the chance of a big bull trend day, despite an overbought market.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-trading-range-day-after-closing-February-gap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-6.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day after closing February gap\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

It is coming in a nested wedge buy climax.<p>This should attract profit taking and some shorting. Traders should expect a couple week pullback to around the EMA. It should also test the breakout point of the March 9 high. There is a 30% chance that it could last longer and fall down to the June 9 low.<p>The bulls hope that the pullback lasts only a few days. The rally from the June 19 low has been a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Every pullback ended after only 1 or 2 days. While that is possible again here, the pattern and the context make a deeper pullback more likely this time.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above last week’s high overnight and then reversed down. The bulls do not want a bear day closing on its low today because that would attract selling and increase the chance of a pullback. They want the trend to continue up indefinitely. Consequently, they will buy selloffs today. They would like today to close above the open so that today would have a bull body on the daily chart. That would increases the chance of another leg up to 1.20 before there is profit taking.<p>The bears want the EURUSD to go down to support on the daily chart. They will sell rallies and try to get today to close on its low. If they are successful, traders would expect lower prices for at least a couple days and possibly a couple weeks.<p>What is most likely? While the EURUSD has reversed down from above last week’s high, the selloff has not been particularly strong. It has traded sideways for a few hours around yesterday’s close. This increases the chance that today will continue sideways and either close around the open or near the low, but not far below the current low.<p>Can today reverse back up to above yesterday’s high? That is unlikely after already reversing down?<p>Can it break strongly to the downside and become a huge bear day? With it sideways for 5 hours, that also is unlikely. Day traders have been scalping for 5 hours and will continue to scalp unless there is a surprise breakout up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-outside-up-day-after-being-outside-down-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini outside up day after being outside down day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But after 7 consecutive bull days on the daily chart, the bears want today to close below the open. If the Emini is near the open in the final hour, it might get drawn to it.

That was the start of the 2 year bear channel. Since the rally is a nested wedge, traders expect a couple legs down to the 20 day EMA over the next two weeks.<p>The selloff could reach the June 19 low and last several weeks. There is a 30% chance of a major trend reversal into a bear trend.<p>At the moment, after the bulls finish their profit taking, they are planning to buy again support. That is at the EMA and the June 10 high breakout point, or maybe the June 19 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off again overnight from just below 1.19. It has tested that price and reversed down several times over the past week.<p>The bulls are hoping that the 2 day selloff is just a bull flag.

They have been buying 1 – 2 day selloffs, but have been unable to break above 1.19.<p>The bears are hoping that yesterday will be the high for at least the next couple of weeks. They have been selling rallies for the past week and they will continue to do that unless the bulls break strongly above 1.19. They will try to get today to close nears its low. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>With the bulls buying selloffs and the bears selling rallies, the EURUSD has been in a trading range for 2 weeks. Day traders will continue to look for small profits until there is a strong breakout up or down. The odds favor a selloff over the next couple weeks.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance are important. So far, the week has a small bull body and big tails up and down.

Despite the trading range price action, the Emini closed on the high of the day and of the week. Since 3 of the past weeks gapped up, there is an increase chance of another gap up on Monday. There is a small chance that it could gap above the February high.<p>Today was the 8th consecutive bull day on the daily chart. That is unusual and it makes a bear day likely on Monday or Tuesday.<p>The bears are hoping for a double top with the February all-time high. They want an abrupt reversal down like after the 8 bull day rally that ended on June 5. There was a 9% selloff over the next 5 days.<p>While this is possible, it is more likely that the bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback and that the Emini will make a new high next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The odds favor a selloff over the next couple weeks.<p>Today is Friday so weekly support and resistance are important. So far, the week has a small bull body and big tails up and down. The bears will try to close the week near the open. It would then be a doji bar on the weekly chart. That would increase the chance of lower prices next week.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-trading-range-day-with-close-on-the-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day with close on the high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>As I said was likely, there were sellers above yesterday’s high and the open of the day was a magnet all day. Despite the trading range price action, the Emini closed on the high of the day and of the week. Since 3 of the past weeks gapped up, there is an increase chance of another gap up on Monday. There is a small chance that it could gap above the February high.<p>Today was the 8th consecutive bull day on the daily chart. That is unusual and it makes a bear day likely on Monday or Tuesday.<p>The bears are hoping for a double top with the February all-time high. They want an abrupt reversal down like after the 8 bull day rally that ended on June 5. There was a 9% selloff over the next 5 days.<p>While this is possible, it is more likely that the bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback and that the Emini will make a new high next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

August is the follow-through bar. Traders know that if August has a bull body, September will probably also go at least a little higher. But if August has even a small bear body, September will probably be sideways to down.<p>September is usually not a strong month in the stock and bond markets. Therefore, if September is to stall or pull back, August will probably have to close below the open of the month. That would require a 1 – 2 week pullback on the weekly chart.<p>Traders know that there is an increased chance of a bear bar on the monthly chart in August. They therefore expect the 9 week bull channel on the weekly chart to begin to turn sideways soon.<h3 id=\"3-weekly-bond-futures-chart-stalling-at-april-high\">Weekly bond futures chart stalling at April high</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-sell-signal-bar-but-in-tight-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-8-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has sell signal bar but in tight bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures weekly chart had another low above the prior week’s low. But the range was small. The bond futures are pausing around the April 22 lower high.<p>Traders are still not sure if the rally will break above the March high or form a lower high. But the weekly chart has been in a tight bull channel for 9 weeks. While the price is not racing up, that persistent buying reduces the chance of a sudden selloff.<p>With traders buying above the prior week’s low for such a long time, they will be eager to buy below the prior week’s low once they finally have the opportunity. Consequently, the 1st reversal down will probably only last a bar or two (a week or two). There should then be at least a brief second leg up. Therefore, most traders will not aggressively short until there is at least a micro double top, which will take at least a couple more weeks to form.<h3 id=\"4-bond-futures-have-small-pullback-bull-trend-on-the-daily-chart\">Bond futures have Small Pullback Bull Trend on the daily chart</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bond-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-turning-down-in-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-8-2.png\" alt=\"Bond futures daily candlestick chart turning down in bull channel\"></a></figure><p>A micro channel on the weekly chart is always a Small Pullback Bull Trend on the daily chart. In this case, it is also the bull channel in a Spike and Channel bull trend. The 4 bull bars on the reversal up from the June 5 low formed the spike up. That was the bull reversal from the June sell climax.<p>Since the rally entered the channel phase with the June 16 pullback, traders have been buying every one to three day pullback. The result has been a tight bull channel (Small Pullback Bull Trend).<p>Some Small Pullback Bull Trends last 50 or more bars and accelerate up. Those that do typically have 2 or more sets of consecutive big bull bars closing near their highs. This rally lacks those strong breakouts. It is therefore more likely a bull leg in what will become a trading range.<p>Traders should expect a break below the bull trend line within a couple weeks. They then should look for a possible 2 – 3 week test down to around the June 16 start of the bull channel. This is consistent with the likely 2 – 3 weeks of sideways to down trading on the weekly chart. Also, it is consistent with the possible sideways move through September on the monthly chart.<h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-charts\">EURUSD Forex charts</h2><h3 id=\"6-stalling-at-the-september-20-high-which-was-the-start-of-the-bear-channel\">Stalling at the September 20 high, which was the start of the bear channel</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-bad-follow-through-buying-after-July-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-8-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has bad follow-through buying after July breakout\"></a></figure><h3 id=\"7-the-eurusd-bulls-need-bull-bar-in-august-\">The EURUSD Bulls need bull bar in August</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex monthly chart had a big bull bar in July that broke above the top of the 2 year bear channel. It also broke above the September 2018 high. That was the start of the bear channel, which followed the strong reversal down in April and May 2018 (the spike down in the 2 year Spike and Channel Bear Trend).<p>However, July closed below both resistance levels. Also, once there is a reversal up from a Spike and Channel Bear Trend, traders look for a test of the start of the channel (here, the September 2018 high) and then a transition into a trading range.<p>The bulls quickly retraced 2 years of selling. Traders are wondering if this strong reversal up will continue up to the February high. That was the start of the 30 month bear trend. While it is possible, that is not what typically happens. Usually the market stalls once it reaches the start of the bear channel. Since the EURUSD is there now, there is an increased chance of at least 2 – 3 weeks of sideways to down trading starting soon.<h3 id=\"8-the-eurusd-daily-chart-has-a-nested-wedge-buy-climax\">The EURUSD daily chart has a nested wedge buy climax</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-has-nested-wedge-buy-climax-and-micro-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-8-4.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart has nested wedge buy climax and micro double top\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart rallied in a parabolic wedge buy climax over the past 3 weeks. That rally was the 3rd leg up of a bigger wedge bull channel that began in March.<p>There is now a micro double top. But Thursday was the sell signal bar and it was only a bull doji. That reduces the chance that a move down began on Friday. The daily chart might have to go sideways for a few days before it can go down.<p>A nested wedge is more likely to reverse. When a wedge reverses, there are several minimum goals. First, traders expect about ten bars and 2 legs sideways to down. Next, they expect a test of support, like the EMA and the breakout points. The rally broke above the March 9 and June 10 highs. Those breakout points are therefore magnets below.<p>Also, a wedge often reverses down to the bottom of the most recent leg up. That is either they July 16 or the June 19 low.<p>Finally, traders look for a retracement of a third to a half of the rally.<p>This all presupposes that the bulls are exhausted and will take profits starting within a week or two. That probably will happen, but with the rally as strong as it has been, there is a 40% chance that it will continue up to the February 2018 without more than a 2 – 3 week pullback.<h2 id=\"9-monthly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h2><h3 id=\"10-5th-consecutive-bull-month-and-rare-gap-up-\">5th consecutive bull month and rare gap up</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-monthly-SP500-futures-candlestick-chart-gapped-up-in-August.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-8-5.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly S&amp;P500 futures candlestick chart gapped up in August\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart gapped up in August. Gaps on the monthly chart are rare. The gap was small and small gaps are typically not especially important.<p>August is forming its 5th consecutive bull bar since reversing up from a 10 year bull trend line in March. This is only the 1st week of August and the month could be very different once it closes. However, the momentum up has been good. Traders will probably buy the 1st 1 – 2 month pullback.<h3 id=\"11-will-the-emini-break-strongly-above-the-february-high\">Will the Emini break strongly above the February high?</h3><p>Can the bulls break far above the February high in August? Of course, but strong rallies usually have some profit taking around major resistance. The February high is an obvious possibility. But if August closes on the high of the month and far above the July high, traders will expect higher prices in September.<p>What happens if August reverses down and closes on its low? It would be a sell signal bar for September for a double top with the February high. However, after 4 strong months up, the 1st reversal down will probably be minor. Many bulls did not buy the rally and have been waiting for a pullback. That will probably limit the selling to a month or two.<p>After a pullback, will the Emini break far above the February high? It is more likely that a 1 month pullback will lead to a micro double top with the August high and at least another sideways month. At that point, traders will decide between a micro double top with the August high or a small bull flag and a resumption up of the bull trend. &nbsp;<h2 id=\"12-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h2><h3 id=\"13-accelerating-up-after-gapping-up-this-week\">Accelerating up after gapping up this week</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-weekly-SP500-futures-candlestick-chart-gapped-up-to-just-below-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-8-6.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly S&amp;P500 futures candlestick chart gapped up to just below all-time high\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart gapped up this week. Since there was a gap down in February, there is now a 4 month island bottom. The bulls are hoping that traders will see this as a sign of strength and encourage them to buy at the high.<p>Three of the past 5 weeks gapped up. The 1st 2 closed, but this week’s gap up stayed open. With this week closing on its high, there is an increased chance of a gap up again next week. There is a small chance of a gap above the February all-time high.<p>There is now a 6 week bull micro channel. That means the low of every bar was above the low of the prior bar for 5 weeks. That is an additional sign of strength and it further increases the chance of higher prices next week.<p>Also, even if next week pulls back, with this much momentum up, traders expect that buyers will soon come in. Consequently, even if there is a reversal down at the February high, the 1st attempt down will probably only last a week or two. The bears will likely need at least a micro double top before they can get a pullback lasting more than 2 weeks.<h2 id=\"14-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\">Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h2><h3 id=\"15-8-consecutive-bull-days-unsustainable-and-therefore-a-buy-climax-\">8 consecutive bull days unsustainable and therefore a buy climax</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-daily-SP500-futures-candlestick-chart-has-8-consecutive-bull-bars-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-8-7.png\" alt=\"Emini daily S&amp;P500 futures candlestick chart has 8 consecutive bull bars\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has had 8 consecutive bull days.

Three of the past 5 weeks gapped up on Monday. The bulls want another gap on the weekly chart again today. There is a small chance of a big gap up to a new all-time high today.<p>Friday was the 8th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart. That is unusual. The last time that happened was on June 5. The Emini sold off 9% over the next 5 days. While that is possible again, it is more likely that the bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback. Traders expect a new all-time high this week.<p>The bears want a double top with the February high and then a reversal down. But with the bull trend as strong as it has been, the Emini will probably have to enter a trading range for a couple weeks before the bears can correct down to below 3,000.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 3 points in the Globex session. It might gap above last week’s high. But small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>Furthermore, after 8 consecutive bull days on the daily chart, day traders expect a bear day today or tomorrow. Buy climaxes sometimes have one final surge before the profit taking begins. While the bulls might get a huge rally to above the all-time high today, it is more likely that they are getting exhausted. This reduces the chance of a big bull day. Traders are probably looking to sell rallies as they take profits or begin to look to short for a 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>Additionally, while the all-time high is an important magnet and within reach today, all magnets are resistance.

It rallied in a nested wedge buy climax to test the September 2018 high and the 1.20 Big Round Number.<p>Traders are now deciding if the final 3 week buy climax was simply a buy vacuum test of resistance or the start of a bull trend. It is probably both.<p>Because of the extreme buy climax, I have been saying that the bulls would take profits. The minimum profit taking should be a couple legs of sideways to down trading to around the EMA.<h3>More profit taking likely</h3><p>What has happened over the past 2 weeks has met the minimum. Will the bulls buy again and break above 1.20, or will the profit taking continue for a couple more weeks and reach support at the March 9 high breakout point? Since the profit taking has only met the minimum expectation, it will probably continue for another week or more.<p>If a bull trend resumes after only minimum profit taking, the rally usually does not get too far before there is more profit taking. Therefore a rally to a new high from here would make the past 2 weeks a likely Final Bull Flag.<br><p>There has not been sustained strong trading up or down for a couple weeks. This trading range price action will probably continue for at least a few more days.<p>Despite 2 weeks of sideways trading, there has been only a single 3 day pullback from the high. There should be at least one more small leg sideways to down. Traders will sell above today’s high.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied early overnight and then sold off to below yesterday’s low. The selloff was in a wedge bear channel. That typically evolves into a trading range The bounce over the past hour is the start of that process.<p>Today will probably remain a trading range day. The bulls want today to close above the open. It would then be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>But since a 2nd leg down is likely, there will likely be sellers above today’s high. Consequently, today will probably not close far above the open and be a strong buy signal bar.<p>Day traders expect the EURUSD to go sideways around yesterday’s low and the open of the day for the remainder of the day. They plan to scalp up and down for 10 – 20 pips. There is always a possible trend, but with the EURUSD in a trading range for now 3 weeks and 2 big reversals so far today, a trading range day is more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-just-below-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal just below all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Three of the past 5 weeks gapped up on Monday. The bulls want another gap on the weekly chart again today. There is a small chance of a big gap up to a new all-time high today.<p>Friday was the 8th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart. That is unusual. The last time that happened was on June 5. The Emini sold off 9% over the next 5 days. While that is possible again, it is more likely that the bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback. Traders expect a new all-time high this week.<p>The bears want a double top with the February high and then a reversal down. But with the bull trend as strong as it has been, the Emini will probably have to enter a trading range for a couple weeks before the bears can correct down to below 3,000.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 3 points in the Globex session. It might gap above last week’s high. But small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>Furthermore, after 8 consecutive bull days on the daily chart, day traders expect a bear day today or tomorrow. Buy climaxes sometimes have one final surge before the profit taking begins. While the bulls might get a huge rally to above the all-time high today, it is more likely that they are getting exhausted. This reduces the chance of a big bull day. Traders are probably looking to sell rallies as they take profits or begin to look to short for a 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>Additionally, while the all-time high is an important magnet and within reach today, all magnets are resistance. That further reduces the chance of a big bull day today.<p>Can today be a big bear day? After 8 bull days, traders are expecting profit taking for at least a day or two.

Because the gap was small, it closed early in the day.<p>The Emini broke above the Globex February high overnight. It will probably break above the day session all-time high today.<p>Yesterday was also the 9th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart. This is rare and therefore climactic. Traders should expect a 70% chance that today or tomorrow will close below the open. This is especially true since a pullback is common when a market breaks above important resistance.<p>If today is bear day, the Emini might pull back for a couple days. But 9 bull bars mean persistent bulls. They will probably buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>This kind of extremely bullish behavior is similar to the late 2018 rally. That abruptly ended with a 10% selloff. It is also similar to the 8 consecutive bull days that ended on June 5. The Emini sold off 9% in 5 days. Extreme buy climaxes have an increased chance of a sharp reversal. But, the reversal is usually minor.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 17 points in the Globex session. It will probably open within a few points of the February all-time high. The bulls want a new high in the day session today. If they do not get it today, they will probably get it within a week or two.<p>After 9 consecutive bull days, today will probably close below the open. Therefore, if there is a strong rally to a new high today, there is an increased chance of a reversal down in the middle of the day. If today closes above the open, tomorrow will probably be a bear day.<p>Can today be a huge bull day? That is unlikely because of the 9 consecutive bull days. Sometimes an extreme climax ends with an especially big bull day. However, it is more likely that there will be a 1 – 3 day pullback and then another test of the February high. At that point, the bears might get a micro double top and then a deeper pullback.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-just-below-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-11.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal just below all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

With 2 sideways legs, it has met the minimum expectation of traders after the buy climax. If today closes near its high, today will be a buy signal bar for a small double bottom.<p>The bulls see the 2 week trading range as a bull flag. But it did not do much to relieve the buy climax. Consequently, if there is a new high within a week, it will probably only last a week or two. This trading range will likely be a Final Bull Flag. The new high should fail to get very far. Traders will look for a deeper and longer pullback after this extreme a buy climax.<p>While it is possible that the Small Pullback Bull Trend continues up to the 1.25 area at the February 2018 high with only 2 – 3 day pullbacks, that is unlikely.<p>The bears are still hoping that the double top will lead to a break below the trading range. They then want a measured move down to the March 9 high breakout point. However, last week’s high was a bull doji bar. That is a weak sell signal.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. Traders expect a 50% chance of a measured move up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market tested the August 3 low overnight and reversed up. The bulls want today to close near its high. Today would then be a buy signal bar on the daily chart in a bull trend. Traders would expect higher prices tomorrow.<p>While the EURUSD has been sideways for 4 hours, day traders have been buying pullbacks. After reversing up from a double bottom on the 5 minute chart at support, today will probably not reverse back down to the low. Traders expect either a trading range or slightly higher prices today.<p>The bears do not want today to close on its high. They therefore are selling rallies. But since they know a trend reversal down is unlikely, they have been scalping for 10 pips.<p>Today traded below yesterday’s low and then above its high. It is therefore an outside up day. Yesterday’s high will probably be a magnet all day. If the bulls can get today to close above yesterday’s high, tomorrow will probably be higher. If the bears can get today to close well below yesterday’s high, they would improve their odds for another leg down a break below the 2 week range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-5min-chart-trading-range-then-bear-breakout.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-11-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After 9 consecutive bull days, traders expected today to close below the open and it finally did.<p>The Emini has rallied strongly for 5 months. The 9 day rally was a buy climax. Strong bull trends often end with buy climaxes. Traders are wondering if this is a double top reversal with the February high. If there is follow-through selling tomorrow, more traders will take profits. The profit taking could grow into a 10% reversal down.<p>I mentioned early in the day in the trading room that I went short today for a trade down on the daily chart. If I get a quick, big profit, I might take it. If tomorrow reverses up strongly, I plan to short more higher.<p>But the buy climax also is a sign of strong bulls. Traders might buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback. If so, the bears will have to wait from a 2nd reversal down from a micro double top with today’s high.<p>There will probably be a 10% selloff beginning this month, like after the 9 consecutive bull bars in January 2018 and the 8 bull bars in June 2020. However, the 9 bull bars in 2018 had 2 more brief legs up before the selloff began. There might be a little more up here as well before the pullback to 3000 begins.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Because the gap was small, it closed early in the day.<p>The Emini broke above the Globex February high overnight. It will probably break above the day session all-time high today.<p>Yesterday was also the 9th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart. This is rare and therefore climactic. Traders should expect a 70% chance that today or tomorrow will close below the open. This is especially true since a pullback is common when a market breaks above important resistance.<p>If today is bear day, the Emini might pull back for a couple days. But 9 bull bars mean persistent bulls. They will probably buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>This kind of extremely bullish behavior is similar to the late 2018 rally. That abruptly ended with a 10% selloff. It is also similar to the 8 consecutive bull days that ended on June 5. The Emini sold off 9% in 5 days. Extreme buy climaxes have an increased chance of a sharp reversal. But, the reversal is usually minor.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 17 points in the Globex session. It will probably open within a few points of the February all-time high. The bulls want a new high in the day session today. If they do not get it today, they will probably get it within a week or two.<p>After 9 consecutive bull days, today will probably close below the open. Therefore, if there is a strong rally to a new high today, there is an increased chance of a reversal down in the middle of the day. If today closes above the open, tomorrow will probably be a bear day.<p>Can today be a huge bull day? That is unlikely because of the 9 consecutive bull days. Sometimes an extreme climax ends with an especially big bull day. However, it is more likely that there will be a 1 – 3 day pullback and then another test of the February high. At that point, the bears might get a micro double top and then a deeper pullback.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-just-below-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-11.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal just below all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-doublle-top-and-double-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-11-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top and double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart has been sideways for a couple weeks. With 2 sideways legs, it has met the minimum expectation of traders after the buy climax. If today closes near its high, today will be a buy signal bar for a small double bottom.<p>The bulls see the 2 week trading range as a bull flag. But it did not do much to relieve the buy climax. Consequently, if there is a new high within a week, it will probably only last a week or two. This trading range will likely be a Final Bull Flag. The new high should fail to get very far. Traders will look for a deeper and longer pullback after this extreme a buy climax.<p>While it is possible that the Small Pullback Bull Trend continues up to the 1.25 area at the February 2018 high with only 2 – 3 day pullbacks, that is unlikely.<p>The bears are still hoping that the double top will lead to a break below the trading range. They then want a measured move down to the March 9 high breakout point. However, last week’s high was a bull doji bar. That is a weak sell signal.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. Traders expect a 50% chance of a measured move up or down.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market tested the August 3 low overnight and reversed up. The bulls want today to close near its high. Today would then be a buy signal bar on the daily chart in a bull trend. Traders would expect higher prices tomorrow.<p>While the EURUSD has been sideways for 4 hours, day traders have been buying pullbacks. After reversing up from a double bottom on the 5 minute chart at support, today will probably not reverse back down to the low. Traders expect either a trading range or slightly higher prices today.<p>The bears do not want today to close on its high. They therefore are selling rallies. But since they know a trend reversal down is unlikely, they have been scalping for 10 pips.<p>Today traded below yesterday’s low and then above its high. It is therefore an outside up day. Yesterday’s high will probably be a magnet all day. If the bulls can get today to close above yesterday’s high, tomorrow will probably be higher. If the bears can get today to close well below yesterday’s high, they would improve their odds for another leg down a break below the 2 week range.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-5min-chart-trading-range-then-bear-breakout.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-11-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After 9 consecutive bull days, traders expected today to close below the open and it finally did.<p>The Emini has rallied strongly for 5 months. The 9 day rally was a buy climax. Strong bull trends often end with buy climaxes. Traders are wondering if this is a double top reversal with the February high. If there is follow-through selling tomorrow, more traders will take profits. The profit taking could grow into a 10% reversal down.<p>I mentioned early in the day in the trading room that I went short today for a trade down on the daily chart. If I get a quick, big profit, I might take it. If tomorrow reverses up strongly, I plan to short more higher.<p>But the buy climax also is a sign of strong bulls. Traders might buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback. If so, the bears will have to wait from a 2nd reversal down from a micro double top with today’s high.<p>There will probably be a 10% selloff beginning this month, like after the 9 consecutive bull bars in January 2018 and the 8 bull bars in June 2020. However, the 9 bull bars in 2018 had 2 more brief legs up before the selloff began. There might be a little more up here as well before the pullback to 3000 begins.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That made it likely that yesterday would close below the open and finally form a bear bar on the daily chart, which it did.<p>Yesterday closed near its low. It is an outside down bar and sell signal bar for today for a double top with the February high. But because it closed above Monday’s low, the bears were not as strong as they could have been. That reduces the chance of a big bear breakout today.<p>Since 9 bull bars is a sign of persistent bulls, they will probably buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback. However, it is a buy climax. After 8 bull days in June, the Emini sold off 9%. After 9 bull days in January 2018, there were a couple brief legs up and then a 10% pullback.<p>Traders should expect a 10% pullback to begin sometime in August. They will then see this 5 month rally as forming a double top with the February high.<p>If yesterday is the start of the pullback, the bears will need follow-through selling today. It is more likely they will not get it. There have been many 1-day selloffs in the past 2 months. None has had follow-through.<p>That is why I have been referring to the 2 month rally as a Small Pullback Bull Trend. The bears will likely need at least a micro double top before a test down to 3,000 begins.<p>Since the 5 month rally has been strong, even a 10% selloff will probably be minor. There will probably then be at least one more test of the February high after the 1st selloff.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 26 points in the Globex session. It will therefore open in the middle of yesterday’s range. The day after a big outside down day often is an inside day. A strong rally frequently reverses down from just below yesterday’s high and traders look for a reversal up from just above yesterday’s low.<p>An outside day is a sideways day. There now are 4 sideways day. Therefore, even if today breaks out of yesterday’s range, the breakout will probably be small. Traders expect a trading range day today. However, the selloff was big enough so that there will probably be a 2nd leg down this week before the bulls will be able to get much above yesterday’s high.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-bear-trend-after-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-12.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend after trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Every trading range has both a reasonable buy and sell signal. This one has a double top and a double bottom bull flag.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. That means there is a 50% chance of a breakout and measured move in either direction. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout in either direction will fail.<p>If there is a successful bear breakout, traders will look to buy a pullback to support. That is around the June 10 breakout point or the June 19 higher low.<p>If there is a successful bull breakout, the rally will probably reverse after a week or two and begin a pullback to test the June 10 high. This is because a trading range in a buy climax is typically the Final Bull Flag. Traders expect the breakout to be brief and reverse down at least to the bottom of the flag.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to below yesterday’s low and then reversed up. The day’s range so far is small and the rally has not been especially strong. But it is coming from the bottom of a 3 week trading range. When a market is in a trading range, traders like to buy.<p>So far, day traders are mostly buying. Once the rally evolves into a trading range, some will look to sell reversals down for scalps.<p>The bulls want a reliable buy signal bar on the daily chart. They will therefore try to get today to close near its high.<p>The bears want the opposite. But after a reversal up from the bottom of a 3 week trading range in a bull trend, the best they will probably be able to get today is a close in the middle of the range.

The bears tried to get a reversal down from an Expanding Triangle top at yesterday’s all-time high. Instead, the Emini went sideways. There was some profit-taking into the close.<p>The bulls want this week’s breakout to go far above the February high. But this rally is extreme.

The Emini on Tuesday broke to a new high, but the high of the cash index did not reach the highest close from February.<p>Yesterday’s high in the cash index finally went above below the all-time highest close from February, but only by about a point. The bulls might try again today to get a new all-time closing high in the cash index.<p>But this is now 2 days where the cash index reversed down around the February close. That is a micro double top, and there is also a possible double top with the February high.<p>How much higher can this rally go? Probably not much. The extreme streak of 9 consecutive bull bars ended on Tuesday. That is an unusually overdone buy climax. There were similar streaks in January 2018 and this June. Both led to about 10% corrections.<p>Traders expect the Emini to soon go sideways to down for a week or two. There is a 40% chance of a 10% pullback beginning this month. That would be similar to the selloffs after the streaks of consecutive bull bars in January 2018 and June 2020.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 1 point in the Globex session. The bulls will try to get the cash index today to close above February’s all-time highest close.<p>Since the Emini is derived from the cash index, traders expect the Emini to try to rally as well. But the 9 consecutive bull bars is an important sign of an extremely overdone rally. Most traders are unaware of the 9 day factor, but they sense that the rally has been extreme. Even if the bulls break strongly to a new high, the rally will probably not go much higher before there is a test down to the 3,000 Big Round Number, which is about 10% down.<p>Yesterday spent most of its time going sideways. That increases the chance of more trading range price action today.<p>Tomorrow is Friday and traders are starting to think about the weekly chart. Will the week become another big bull bar, like the past 2 weeks? Unlikely, but the bulls still want it to close on the high. The bears want it to close below the open so that this week will be a bear bar.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-Bull-Trend-From-The-Open-then-Expanding-Triangle-Top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-13.png\" alt=\"Emini Bull Trend From The Open then Expanding Triangle Top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders are deciding whether the bull trend should resume from the double bottom bull flag, or if the pullback will continue down from the small double top.<p>A trading range always has both a reasonable buy and sell setup. This is a Breakout Mode situation. Traders know that there is a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout. Furthermore, they know that there is a 50% chance that the 1st attempt will fail.<p>Finally, they believe that a measured move up or down will be followed by a reversal back to the trading range. Since the bull trend has been strong, a selloff down to the breakout point of the June 10 high will still be a pullback. Traders would expect a test back up.<p>Also, a trading range late in a bull trend is usually the Final Bull Flag. Therefore, a measured move up will probably come back down to the trading range.<p>Yesterday was a buy signal bar for a double bottom bull flag. But the prominent tail on top of the candlestick and the bar not closing above Tuesday’s high make it a low probability buy signal bar.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high, which triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar on the daily chart. It has tried several to break far above but is has been failing. The rally is a wedge and it is evolving into a trading range. Day traders have been scalping up and down for 10 – 20 pips all night. There is no sign that this is about to end.<p>Since the buy setup on the daily chart was weak, today will probably not rally far above yesterday’s high. Also, the EURUSD is in the middle of a 3 week range on the daily chart. Trader prefer to sell higher in a trading range. Also, yesterday was a bull bar at the bottom of the range. Finally, the EURUSD rallied, albeit weakly, overnight. These factors make a big bear day unlikely.<p>The bulls want today to close above yesterday’s high. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices tomorrow. The bears want today to close on its low. That is unlikely. At a minimum, they want it to close below yesterday’s high and preferably below the midpoint.<p>Day traders expect today to continue in a trading range around yesterday’s high.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-13-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini fell to a new low. But the bars became big and there were many reversals. Today was a trending trading range day. It closed around the open and formed a doji inside bar on the daily chart.<p>The cash index is controlling the market right now. The bulls want a new all-time high close. As long as the Emini does not selloff strongly in the next few days, the cash index should make a new all-time high close. Remember, the institutions are only interested in the closes on the cash index.<p>Tomorrow is Friday so weekly support and resistance can be important. The bulls want the week to close near its high. They also want the cash index to close at a new all-time high. A strong close this week increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>It is important to remember that the Emini will probably begin a move down to 3,000 this month after the 9 consecutive bull bars.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It again reversed down. The Emini yesterday was an inside day and it closed around the open. It was therefore a doji bar on the daily chart, which is a sign of neutrality.<p>The bulls want a strong breakout above that highest close on the cash index. They also want the week to close on its high and for the cash index to close at a new all-time high on the weekly chart.<p>The Emini is a derivative of the cash index and it moves almost identically with it. This would result in a bull day and a strong weekly close in the Emini as well<p>Today is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important. This is especially true in the final hour. The bulls want the cash index to close at a new all-time high.<p>It is important to note that 5 of the past 6 weeks gapped up on the weekly chart. Therefore, the bulls will try to get the week to close near the high again. That would increase the chance of another gap up on Monday.<p>The bears know that the Emini will probably not close at the low of the week on the weekly chart because it is far below. However, they would like the week to close below the February high and preferably below the open of the week.<p>Since the cash index is at a critical price, there is an increased chance of a big breakout or a big reversal down. With so much sideways trading around the February highest close on the cash index, today will probably be mostly sideways. Traders should expect a 10% correction to begin by the end of the month.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up one point in the Globex session. Yesterday was sideways within 2 trading ranges.<p>There was a higher low major trend reversal in the final hour. The bulls want a reversal up from there and then another test of the all-time high on the cash index.<p>If the week closes on its high, there will be an increased chance of higher prices next week. Remember, 4 of the past weeks gapped on on the weekly chart. A strong close this week would increase the chance of a gap up to a new all-time high next week<p>The bears want a series of lower highs and therefore a bear trend. Also, they want the week to close below the open. That would create a bear body on the weekly chart.<p>With 2 days of sideways trading at the resistance of the February high, the Emini will most likely have a lot of trading range trading again today. Day traders expect at least one swing up and one swing down. Because of the location at major resistance, there is a slightly increased chance of a big trend up or down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This trading range is currently also a triangle. There is a double top and a double bottom, but no sign of an imminent breakout.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is a 50% chance of a successful breakout in either direction. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance of the 1st breakout failing.<p>Finally, in this particular case, it is in a buy climax in a strong bull trend. If there is a bear breakout down to support, there will probably be buyers below and then a test back up.<p>If there is a bull breakout, the bulls will probably be exhausted. Traders will expect a reversal back down to the triangle within a few weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market dipped below yesterday’s low and reversed back up. The range is only 35 pips and the EURUSD is in the middle of the 3 week triangle. Traders expect the trading range trading to continue. Day traders have been scalping for 10 – 20 pips.<p>Today is Friday so there is an increased chance of a move toward weekly support and resistance.

It again reversed down. The Emini yesterday was an inside day and it closed around the open. It was therefore a doji bar on the daily chart, which is a sign of neutrality.<p>The bulls want a strong breakout above that highest close on the cash index. They also want the week to close on its high and for the cash index to close at a new all-time high on the weekly chart.<p>The Emini is a derivative of the cash index and it moves almost identically with it. This would result in a bull day and a strong weekly close in the Emini as well<p>Today is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important. This is especially true in the final hour. The bulls want the cash index to close at a new all-time high.<p>It is important to note that 5 of the past 6 weeks gapped up on the weekly chart. Therefore, the bulls will try to get the week to close near the high again. That would increase the chance of another gap up on Monday.<p>The bears know that the Emini will probably not close at the low of the week on the weekly chart because it is far below. However, they would like the week to close below the February high and preferably below the open of the week.<p>Since the cash index is at a critical price, there is an increased chance of a big breakout or a big reversal down. With so much sideways trading around the February highest close on the cash index, today will probably be mostly sideways. Traders should expect a 10% correction to begin by the end of the month.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up one point in the Globex session. Yesterday was sideways within 2 trading ranges.<p>There was a higher low major trend reversal in the final hour. The bulls want a reversal up from there and then another test of the all-time high on the cash index.<p>If the week closes on its high, there will be an increased chance of higher prices next week. Remember, 4 of the past weeks gapped on on the weekly chart. A strong close this week would increase the chance of a gap up to a new all-time high next week<p>The bears want a series of lower highs and therefore a bear trend. Also, they want the week to close below the open. That would create a bear body on the weekly chart.<p>With 2 days of sideways trading at the resistance of the February high, the Emini will most likely have a lot of trading range trading again today. Day traders expect at least one swing up and one swing down. Because of the location at major resistance, there is a slightly increased chance of a big trend up or down.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-bear-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This trading range is currently also a triangle. There is a double top and a double bottom, but no sign of an imminent breakout.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is a 50% chance of a successful breakout in either direction. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance of the 1st breakout failing.<p>Finally, in this particular case, it is in a buy climax in a strong bull trend. If there is a bear breakout down to support, there will probably be buyers below and then a test back up.<p>If there is a bull breakout, the bulls will probably be exhausted. Traders will expect a reversal back down to the triangle within a few weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market dipped below yesterday’s low and reversed back up. The range is only 35 pips and the EURUSD is in the middle of the 3 week triangle. Traders expect the trading range trading to continue. Day traders have been scalping for 10 – 20 pips.<p>Today is Friday so there is an increased chance of a move toward weekly support and resistance. The bulls want today to close on the high and the high of the week is therefore a magnet. That would increase the chance of higher prices next week. However, that is 50 pips above the current price and probably out of reach today.<p>The week is a doji bar so far on the weekly chart. The bears want the week to have a bear body.

that ended this week. Traders should expect a 10% correction to begin by the end of the month.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are correcting down from a Spike and Channel Bull Trend on the daily chart. The selloff should test the June 16 low and then the bond futures will probably go sideways for a couple weeks.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex weekly chart has 8 consecutive bull bars. This has not happened since 2004. Traders should expect a pullback at least to the June 10 high to begin within a couple weeks.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-pulling-back-\"><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures pulling back</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-monthly-bond-futures-in-august-reversed-july-rally\"><strong>Monthly</strong>bond futures in August reversed July rally</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Treasury-bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-with-failed-breakout-bull-trap.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-15.png\" alt=\"Treasury bond futures monthly candlestick chart with failed breakout bull trap\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures monthly chart in August totally reversed the July rally. June was a buy signal bar. At the time, I said that it was a weak buy setup. This is because it was a doji bar and it was only 3 months after a reversal down from the biggest buy climax in history. I wrote many times that the most likely outcome was for the bond market to go sideways for the remainder of the year. This is still true.<p>The bulls were hoping that July was going to be the start of a rally to a new high. I said that most traders would only believe that if August was a strong follow-through month. The wanted to see a 2nd big bull bar closing on its high. Instead, August so far is a big bear bar trading at its low and totally reversed July. There are still 2 weeks left and the month could be back to neutral or even bullish by the end of the month, but that is unlikely.<p>Is the monthly chart now bearish? No. When a chart is sideways, it often has one or two strong bars up or down. Unless there are consecutive strong trend bars in either direction, the chart is more likely to go sideways.<h3 id=\"3-how-big-will-the-pullback-from-the-march-buy-climax-be\">How big will the pullback from the March buy climax be?</h3><p>My default estimate for a pullback after a buy climax is that it has at least 2 legs sideways to down and lasts about 10 bars. If the trend tries to resume before then, most bulls are usually still in profit taking mode. They like to see the bears make 2 or 3 failed attempts at reversing the trend down before they will be eager to buy again.<p>So far, June has been the only leg down. The bulls are not certain that the bears have made their best effort yet. They want to see the bears try 2 or 3 times and fail. There would then be either a double bottom bull flag or a wedge bull flag. By the time the pattern becomes clear, the exhausted bulls will be rested and more willing to buy again. The monthly chart has probably not corrected long enough for traders to expect the bull trend to resume.<h3 id=\"4-will-the-bull-trend-resume\">Will the bull trend resume?</h3><p>Does the bull trend have to resume? Not at all. This bull trend has lasted several decades. Most trends in the bond market last 20 to 30 years. Consequently, traders should be open to the prospect of a reversal down for a decade or more.<p>The bears have not done enough to make traders believe a bear trend has begun. on the monthly chart. But the bulls have a problem. They can maybe get one more new high but probably not much more. A new high means interest rates will fall further. People will wonder if Trump will get his way and get negative rates.<p>But, I have said many times that<a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-consecutive-parabolic-wedge-tops-november-pullback-likely/#Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Americans will not accept negative interest rates</a>. Too many retirees depend on interest bearing accounts. And there are too many retirees for politicians to take that income away.<h2 id=\"5-bond-futures-daily-chart-reversed-down-from-spike-and-channel-rally\">Bond futures<strong>daily</strong>chart reversed down from Spike and Channel rally</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Treasury-bond-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-breaking-below-bull-trend-line.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-15-1.png\" alt=\"Treasury bond futures daily candlestick chart breaking below bull trend line\"></a></figure><p>The daily bond futures rallied sharply to the June 11 high from a sell climax that ended with the June 5 low. That bull reversal was a spike up. After pulling back for 3 days, the rally converted to a bull channel.<p>The Spike and Channel Bull Trend ended with a wedge buy climax on August 6. The bond futures sold off sharply this week.<p>A wedge bull channel typically leads to a swing down that has 2 or more legs. A wedge is a buy climax ,and the reversal down from a buy climax usually has 2 or more legs. This week was the 1st leg down. The bears will sell the 1st bounce to a lower high in the next week or two, expecting at least one more leg sideways to down.<h3 id=\"6-support-is-at-the-start-of-the-bull-channel\">Support is at the start of the bull channel</h3><p>The target is the start of the bull channel. That is the June 16 low of 174 29/32. Once the selloff reaches around that support, traders expect a bounce and then a trading range. They then watch for the next pattern to develop from within that trading range.<p>Will this selloff follow the textbook path that I just outlined? Nothing ever happens as expected. However, the overall concept will probably unfold. Traders expect a couple legs down to support and then confusion, which means a trading range for a couple weeks.<p>Can the selloff continue down to the June 5 sell climax low or even break strongly below it? Anything is possible, but a trading range will probably begin within a week. This is consistent with the monthly chart where the 5 month trading range could last all year.<h2 id=\"7-eurusd-forex-market-stalling-at-the-september-2018-high-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market stalling at the September 2018 high</strong></h2><h2 id=\"8-august-is-follow-through-bar-on-eurusd-forex-monthly-chart\">August is follow-through bar on EURUSD Forex<strong>monthly</strong>chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-follow-through-bar-after-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-15-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart follow-through bar after bull breakout\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex monthly chart had a huge bull bar in July.

Traders expect at least a small 2nd leg sideways to up.<p>But I have been saying for several weeks that August will be important. If August is a 2nd big bull bar closing near its high, the breakout will probably reach the February 2018 high before the end of the year.<p>However, August will probably not be a big bull bar. Why? Because the 1st rally after a Spike and Channel Bear Trend typically stalls around the start of the bear channel. As I said, that is the September 2018 high.<p>If August is a bull bar, it will probably be small. While that will increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices within the next few bars (months), it would be a sign that the rally has lost momentum. Traders would expect the EURUSD to be sideways for a month or two.<p>What if August closes on its low? Then September will probably pull back. If August is a big bear bar closing on its low, not only will the bulls exit, many bears will sell. They will conclude that the July bull breakout will likely fail. They will see it as a bull trap and a double top with the September 2018 high.<h2 id=\"9-eurusd-weekly-chart-has-had-8-consecutive-bull-bars\">EURUSD<strong>weekly</strong>chart has had 8 consecutive bull bars</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-extreme-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-15-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has extreme buy climax\"></a></figure><p>This was the 8th consecutive week on the weekly chart with a bull body. That is unusual and therefore unsustainable. It is therefore a type of buy climax.<p>Traders expect a bear bar next week. This is especially true since the weekly chart has been sideways for 3 weeks. The bull trend is losing momentum. Also, the past 2 weeks were doji bars. They closed near the open. That means the bears were about as strong as the bulls.<p>Traders sense that the rally is climactic, but most are unaware of the 8 consecutive bull bars and how unusual that is. The last time this happened was in 2004. The streak at that time was 11 consecutive bull bars. There was a small 2nd leg up and then a yearlong selloff that continued down to below all 11 bull bars. That is an example of why I refer to this as a buy climax.<p>Will the EURUSD reverse down to below the low of the 8 bull bars this time? It might because that is the bottom of the 3rd leg up in the wedge. That is a common target for a reversal after a wedge.<h2 id=\"10-eurusd-daily-chart-in-breakout-mode\">EURUSD<strong>daily</strong>chart in Breakout Mode</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-daily-candlestick-chart-has-nested-wedge-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-15-4.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex daily candlestick chart has nested wedge buy climax\"></a></figure><p>Because the EURUSD has reached its most important target, albeit quickly, traders will probably be uncertain about what will follow. Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range, and the daily chart has been sideways for 3 weeks.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern. There is a 50% chance of a successful bull breakout and a 50% chance of a successful bear breakout. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout up or down will fail.<h3 id=\"11-bears-want-a-reversal-down-from-a-small-double-top\">Bears want a reversal down from a small double top</h3><p>Every trading range has both a buy and sell setup. The bears want a measured move down from the small double top. That would be a test of the June 10 high breakout point. It might also fall to the June 19 start of the last leg up.<p>However, the bull trend has been strong. A reversal down, even to that low, would probably lead to a trading range and not a bear trend. There would probably be a test a few weeks later back up to the August high. Therefore, if there is a measured move down, there probably then will be a reversal back up into the trading range.<h3 id=\"12-the-bulls-want-the-bull-trend-to-resume-up-from-a-double-bottom-bull-flag\">The bulls want the bull trend to resume up from a double bottom bull flag</h3><p>The bulls see the 3 week trading range as a bull flag. But a bull flag late in a bull trend is usually the Final Bull Flag. This is especially true when there is a buy climax. The 6 month nested wedge rally is a buy climax.<p>When there is a break above any bull flag, traders look for around a measured move up. But if the flag is a good candidate for a Final Flag, traders then look for a reversal back down to the bottom of the flag. Therefore, if there is a measured move up, there will probably then be a reversal back into the trading range.<p>Since a bull or bear breakout will probably return to the trading range within a month or two, the EURUSD daily chart will probably evolve into a big trading range for a couple months.<h2 id=\"13-sampp500-emini-futures-buy-climax-at-february-high-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures buy climax at February high</strong></h2><h2 id=\"14-monthly-emini-chart-in-strong-5-month-rally-to-new-all-time-high\"><strong>Monthly</strong>Emini chart in strong 5 month rally to new all-time high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-5-consecutive-bull-bars-at-a-new-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-15-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart has 5 consecutive bull bars at a new high\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has rallied strongly for 5 months from the March sell climax down to the 10 year bull trend line. While the Emini broke above the February high, the breakout so far has been small.<p>Also, there are 2 weeks left to the month and August could look very different once the bar closes. For example, the range is not big. Therefore, a 2 week selloff could reverse down to below the open of the month. August would then be a bear reversal bar and a sell signal bar for a double top with the February high.<p>But even if that were to happen, the 5 month rally was surprisingly strong. A Bull Surprise rally typically has at least a small 2nd leg up. Consequently, traders will buy the 1st reversal down.<p>This is true even if it is big and fast. A strong bull trend like this usually cannot immediately reverse into a bear trend without at least forming a micro double top first.<p>To create a micro double top, there needs to be a 1 – 2 bar selloff and then a rally back up to around the old high. In this case, if the selloff begins in August, the August high would be a magnet 2 – 4 months from now.<h3 id=\"15-how-much-higher-can-the-bull-trend-go\">How much higher can the bull trend go?</h3><p>Can the 5 bar (month) rally grow into a 10 bar rally? While possible, that is unlikely. Traders already see this rally as overdone.<p>The stops for the bulls are below the March low. Traders are therefore risking about 35%. Risk managers at trading firms will soon start to tell traders to take some profits to reduce that risk. Therefore, even if the rally goes a lot higher, there will probably be at least a 1 month pullback starting within a couple months.<h2 id=\"16-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\"><strong>Weekly</strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h2><h3 id=\"17-wedge-rally-to-possible-double-top\">Wedge rally to possible double top</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-rally-to-a-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-15-6.png\" alt=\"Emini SP500 futures weekly chart has wedge rally to double top\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart gapped up on 4 of the past 6 weeks so the bulls have been aggressive. However, only one of the gaps remained open, which is not what traders expect in a bull trend that will go much higher. Something is wrong. Also, this week barely broke to a new all-time high, but it closed below the February high.<p>As strong as the 5 month rally has been, this is the 3rd leg up from the March low. This is therefore a wedge rally to a possible double top. That combination is a common reversal pattern. Also, the 3rd leg up is a 7 bar bull micro channel, which is a buy climax. While there is no reversal yet and the Emini could continue much high, the odds now favor a pullback beginning soon from this area.<p>In June, there was a tight trading range. It came late in a bull trend and it is therefore a candidate for a Final Bull Flag. If there is a reversal down from around the February high, traders will expect it to reach the bottom of that flag. That is around 3,000 and it would be about a 10% correction.<h2 id=\"18-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\"><strong>Daily</strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h2><h3 id=\"19-after-9-consecutive-bull-bars-pullback-likely-soon\">After 9 consecutive bull bars, pullback likely soon</h3><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-had-9-consecutive-bull-bars-so-extreme-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-15-7.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart had 9 consecutive bull bars so extreme buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart broke to a new all-time high this week. But it was too strong. The rally had 9 consecutive bull bars. Since that is rare, it is unsustainable and a buy climax.<p>There were 8 consecutive bull bars in June. Five days later, the Emini was down 8%.<p>The next earlier time with 8 consecutive bull bars was in January of 2018. That streak was 9 bars, like the current one. That rally was the 1st leg up in a parabolic wedge buy climax. The top came 9 days later and the Emini sold off 10% over the next 2 weeks.<p>Traders should expect a similar pullback after this buy climax. Will there be a couple more brief legs up to a parabolic wedge top like in 2018? This rally does not look climactic enough for that. More likely, it will begin to turn down before the end of the month without going much higher. The bulls might want the cash index to make a new all-time high first.<p>On the cash chart, institutions look at the close. This week poke above the February highest close a couple times but could not close above it. The bulls will likely try again next week. The will probably succeed, but traders should still expect a minor reversal to start before the end of the month.<p>A common target is the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the low of the 1st of the 9 bull bars and it is around 3200. Below that is the June trading range at around 3000. Since that is about 10% down and that is comparable in size to the other streaks that I mentioned, the Emini will probably get there before the end of September.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2 id=\"20-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Friday is a High 1 buy signal bar for today. However, it is a doji bar in a 3 bar tight trading range, which is a weak buy setup. Despite that, traders expect the cash index to make a new all-time closing high this week.<p>Four of the past 6 weeks gapped up on the weekly chart. The Emini is within a couple points of last week’s high in the Globex session. It might again gap up on the weekly chart. But, small gaps usually close before the bar closes. That means by the end of the week. If there is a gap up and it is only a couple points, it will probably close today.<p>It is important to note that there were 9 consecutive bull days on the daily chart. That is climactic. Traders should expect a pullback to around 3,000 to begin by the end of the month. This is true even though the cash index will probably close at a new all-time high early this week.<p>The driving force is the cash market. It tested its all-time highest close several times last week but failed to make a new all-time highest close. The bulls will probably try again today. They should succeed this week.<p>But will today be a bull trend day? It might be. The Emini could rally for another week or two before the effect of the 9 consecutive bull bars takes hold.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 15 points in the Globex session. This is within a few points of last week’s high. Today might gap up again on the weekly chart. Since small gaps usually close before the bar is complete, the gap should close by the end of the week.<p>A breakout above major support sometimes comes with a big bull trend day. Can today be a big bear day? Unlikely. The bulls will probably get a close in the cash market above the February all-time highest close. That means today will probably not be a big bear day. But, as I said, a selloff on the daily chart is likely to begin this month. It therefore could begin today. However, a new closing high in the cash index is more likely.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-trending-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-17.png\" alt=\"Emini trending trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It has at least 2 legs sideways to down and it has lasted at least 10 days. This meets the minimum expectation of traders for a pullback after a buy climax. The bulls are now willing to buy again.<p>We will probably find out this week if the trading range is a bull flag or a top. Since it is in a bull trend, it is slightly more likely to be a bull flag. However, a horizontal trading range late in a bull trend usually is the Final Bull Flag. Consequently, if the bulls get their breakout, there will probably be a reversal down within a couple weeks. If so, traders will expect a bigger pullback. It could last a few weeks and test the June 10 high or the June 19 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above Friday’s high today. This therefore triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal. However, it is near the top of a 3 week trading range, which is a bad context for a trend.<p>The EURUSD overnight has been in a trading range around yesterday’s high. Day traders have been scalping for 10 pips.<p>This is the 5th day without a bear body on the daily chart. That makes a big bear day unlikely today. It also increases the chance of a big bull day. The bulls want a strong breakout above the 3 week range. There is a sightly increased chance of a bull breakout above the overnight range and then a trend day to above the August high.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-17-2.png\" alt=\"\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Because it was hanging just below that resistance instead of reversing down, I have been saying that the bulls would not consider taking profits until after a new closing high. They got their new closing high yesterday.<p>The reason why they will likely begin to take some profits before the end of the month is that the Emini had a streak of 9 consecutive bull days that ended last week. That is extreme and the Emini should retrace down to the start of that streak at a minimum. That means a test of 3200.<p>But the 2 prior similar streaks led to about 10% corrections. Consequently, the profit taking might continue down to around the 3000 Big Round Number.<h3>Might get outside down and an oo pattern</h3><p>Yesterday was an outside up day at a price where traders are looking for either a breakout or a reversal. Since yesterday’s range was not big, there is an increased chance of today trading above yesterday’s high and then trending down to below yesterday’s low.<p>That would create an oo pattern (consecutive outside bars), which is a Breakout Mode setup. Today would be both a buy and a sell signal bar for tomorrow.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 2 points in the Globex session. The bulls want a gap up and at test of the 3400 Big Round Number. They know that the cash index is at a price where it might reverse. They therefore want a big bull day closing on its high. That would increase the chance of follow-through buying over the next few days.<p>The bears want today to be a sell signal bar. For example, it could trade above yesterday’s high and close near its low, it could be an inside bar closing near its low, or it could be an outside down bar, especially if it closed near its low and below yesterday’s low.<p>What is most likely? The Emini has had a lot of trading range days around the February high. It is therefore likely that today will again have at least one swing up and one swing down. Also, it could be another small day like Monday. This could create an ioi (inside-outside-inside) Breakout Mode pattern for tomorrow.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-19.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bar was a bigger bar so it might soon attract profit takers. However, after 6 consecutive bull bars, the bulls will buy the 1st pullback. They are hoping it is a measuring gap for a 200 pip measured move up.<p>A trading range is a Breakout Mode pattern so there is a 50% chance of the breakout reversing down. Furthermore, a trading range late in a bull trend is a candidate for a Final Bull Flag. Therefore, even if the rally reaches the target, traders will look for a reversal down.<p>The past 6 days were bull days. While this is extreme and therefore climactic, it is a sign of strong bulls. Many bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback. Traders will want to see at least a micro double top before concluding that this breakout is failing.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a tight trading range overnight. It is within yesterday’s range and oscillating around yesterday’s close and today’s open. It is the follow-through day after yesterday’s breakout. As long as today does not have a bear body, traders will expect at least a small 2nd leg up.<p>However, if there is even a 1 pip bear body, traders will begin to wonder if the breakout will fail. If it is a bear bar with at least a 20 pip body and a close on its low, the odds will shift in favor of a failed breakout.<p>Today will probably remain small and sideways, but its close will be important. So far, day traders have been scalping for 10 pips. But because follow-though bars can affect the direction of the next few days, there is an increased chance of a big trend day up or down.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-wedge-top-and-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It is still a sell signal bar for tomorrow, but the setup is not as good. It is at the bottom of a 3 day tight trading range so the probability is less. The stop is far above so the risk is big.<p>Is this the start of the move down to 3200 that I said will begin by the end of the month? It might be, but the bears need a strong bear day tomorrow.

It then sold off sharply to just above Tuesday’s low. The bears were not strong enough to break below Tuesday’s low and create an oo sell signal.<p>But since it closed near its low, it is a sell signal bar for today. However, because the Emini has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since June, any reversal down will be minor. This is true even if it tests the June 29 Final Bull Flag low. Traders will expect a rally back up to this week’s all-time high later in the year.<p>The cash index has not yet broken far above the February high, and traders are wondering about a double top. Also, that streak of 9 consecutive bull days in the Emini that ended last week is still important. That is an extreme enough buy climax for traders to expect a 200 point pullback down to the start of the 9 day streak, which is the July 30 low just below 3200.<p>The Emini should begin to reverse down by the end of the month. The reversal might have begun yesterday. If there is strong follow-through selling over the next few days, then the reversal is probably underway.<p>If the Emini reaches that July 30 low, traders will then wonder about a 10% pullback, like after the 2018 streak and the June 2020 streak. That would be a test of the 3000 Big Round Number.<p>Tomorrow is Friday and the week so far is a small bear doji. Weekly support and resistance will become increasingly important. The bulls want the week to close on its high. The bears want the week to close on its low. At a minimum, they want the cash index to close back below the February highest close. That corresponds to around 3381 in the Emini.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 13 points in the Globex session. It might gap down. But it is near the bottom of a 6 day tight trading range and the bears yesterday were not strong enough to push below Tuesday’s low. This increases the chance of disappointing follow-through selling today. However, yesterday is a good candidate for the start of a 200 point selloff over the next few weeks.<p>So far, this week is a small bear bar on the weekly chart. After 9 consecutive bull bars, this week will probably close below the open of the week and finally create a bear bar. It will then be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<p>But, because the Emini is just above the bottom of a 6 day tight trading range and there have been 9 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart, the Emini will probably not form a big bear bar on the weekly chart this week. Traders should expect a close below the open of the week but not far below. Therefore, the Emini will probably be mostly sideways today and tomorrow and finish the week below the 3378.75 open of the week.<p>Yesterday’s selling was climactic. While there might be some follow-through selling in the 1st hour or two, there will probably be at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-wedge-top-and-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-20.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But this rally has had 6 consecutive bull bars. While climactic, it is relentless buying. Traders expect some buying today around yesterday’s close and below Tuesday’s low. Six consecutive bull bars do not typically reverse into a bear trend. The bears typically need at least a small double top.<p>The week is back near the open of the week. So far, this is the 4th consecutive week with prominent tails and a close near the open of the week. And it is coming at the resistance of the September 2018 high. I have been talking about that as a magnet for over a years. Finally, the weekly chart has rallied in a parabolic wedge since the March low. That usually will attract profit takers. Therefore, despite the huge 4 month rally, the EURUSD will probably be sideways to down for at least another month. At a minimum, it should test the breakout point above the June high within a couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to just below yesterday’s low and reversed up. Traders expected that there would be no follow-through selling immediately after 6 consecutive bull bars.<p>The Emini will probably be sideways around the open of the week through the week’s close tomorrow. The fight will be over the close of the week. After 8 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart, this week or next week should have a bear body. Therefore, traders will sell rallies, expecting the week to close at least 1 pip below the open.

It then sold off sharply to just above Tuesday’s low. The bears were not strong enough to break below Tuesday’s low and create an oo sell signal.<p>But since it closed near its low, it is a sell signal bar for today. However, because the Emini has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since June, any reversal down will be minor. This is true even if it tests the June 29 Final Bull Flag low. Traders will expect a rally back up to this week’s all-time high later in the year.<p>The cash index has not yet broken far above the February high, and traders are wondering about a double top. Also, that streak of 9 consecutive bull days in the Emini that ended last week is still important. That is an extreme enough buy climax for traders to expect a 200 point pullback down to the start of the 9 day streak, which is the July 30 low just below 3200.<p>The Emini should begin to reverse down by the end of the month. The reversal might have begun yesterday. If there is strong follow-through selling over the next few days, then the reversal is probably underway.<p>If the Emini reaches that July 30 low, traders will then wonder about a 10% pullback, like after the 2018 streak and the June 2020 streak. That would be a test of the 3000 Big Round Number.<p>Tomorrow is Friday and the week so far is a small bear doji. Weekly support and resistance will become increasingly important. The bulls want the week to close on its high. The bears want the week to close on its low. At a minimum, they want the cash index to close back below the February highest close. That corresponds to around 3381 in the Emini.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 13 points in the Globex session. It might gap down. But it is near the bottom of a 6 day tight trading range and the bears yesterday were not strong enough to push below Tuesday’s low. This increases the chance of disappointing follow-through selling today. However, yesterday is a good candidate for the start of a 200 point selloff over the next few weeks.<p>So far, this week is a small bear bar on the weekly chart. After 9 consecutive bull bars, this week will probably close below the open of the week and finally create a bear bar. It will then be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart.<p>But, because the Emini is just above the bottom of a 6 day tight trading range and there have been 9 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart, the Emini will probably not form a big bear bar on the weekly chart this week. Traders should expect a close below the open of the week but not far below. Therefore, the Emini will probably be mostly sideways today and tomorrow and finish the week below the 3378.75 open of the week.<p>Yesterday’s selling was climactic. While there might be some follow-through selling in the 1st hour or two, there will probably be at least a couple hours of sideways to up trading that starts by the end of the 2nd hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-wedge-top-and-late-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-20.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge top and late bear breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid.

But this rally has had 6 consecutive bull bars. While climactic, it is relentless buying. Traders expect some buying today around yesterday’s close and below Tuesday’s low. Six consecutive bull bars do not typically reverse into a bear trend. The bears typically need at least a small double top.<p>The week is back near the open of the week. So far, this is the 4th consecutive week with prominent tails and a close near the open of the week. And it is coming at the resistance of the September 2018 high. I have been talking about that as a magnet for over a years. Finally, the weekly chart has rallied in a parabolic wedge since the March low. That usually will attract profit takers. Therefore, despite the huge 4 month rally, the EURUSD will probably be sideways to down for at least another month. At a minimum, it should test the breakout point above the June high within a couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off to just below yesterday’s low and reversed up. Traders expected that there would be no follow-through selling immediately after 6 consecutive bull bars.<p>The Emini will probably be sideways around the open of the week through the week’s close tomorrow. The fight will be over the close of the week. After 8 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart, this week or next week should have a bear body. Therefore, traders will sell rallies, expecting the week to close at least 1 pip below the open. It is currently trading only 10 pips above the open of the week.<p>After 8 bull weeks, this week will probably not be a big bear bar. Therefore, traders will buy rallies down to around 1800.<p>Day traders will be scalping, looking for the EURUSD to trade sideways through the end of the week. It will probably close below the open and finally have a bear body on the weekly chart.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Yesterday was another brief pullback. It is a buy signal bar for today.<p>However, the dominant feature on the daily chart is the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended last week. That is an extreme buy climax. Traders should expect a 200 point drop to the bottom of that streak before the Emini goes much higher. The reversal down might have begun on Wednesday, but there could be one more brief new high first.<p>Today is the last day of the week. If the week closes on its low, traders will expect lower prices. Even if it simply closes below the open of the week, the bear body would be enough to increase the chance of at least sideways to down trading next week.<p>If the week closes on the high, the Emini might go a little higher before retracing the 9 consecutive bull bars. The reversal down should begin by the end of the month. It might have begun this week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 14 points in the Globex session. Yesterday was a Spike and Channel Bull Trend. Traders should think of a bull channel as a bear flag because there is a 75% chance of a break below the bull trend line.<p>A channel usually evolves into a trading range. Therefore, there is an increased chance that today will be a trading range day. Since it will open with yesterday’s range and yesterday’s range was big, today could be an inside day. It would then be both a buy and sell signal bar for next week.<p>Can today be a 2nd big bull day? Of course. However, there is probably little left to the rally on the daily chart near-term after the streak of 9 consecutive bull days ended last week.<p>Can it be a huge bear day? This week would then close on the low and be a strong sell signal bar for next week.<p>More likely, it will have at least one swing up and one swing down and be mostly a trading range day. It could stay around the open of the week today because it has oscillated around the open all week and today is Friday. Then, in the final hour, traders will decide if the week will have a bull or bear body on the weekly chart. Either way, the Emini should begin to trend down soon for at least a couple weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-21.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Since the trading range is late in a bull trend and the bull trend is a nested wedge, the trading range will probably be the Final Bull Flag.<p>The buy climax was so extreme that the bulls might be unwilling to buy aggressively again for several weeks. The pullback should test the breakout point of the March high and possibly the June 100 high. That means the selloff could retrace 500 pips.<p>Today traded above yesterday’s high and triggered a High 1 buy signal. However, the EURUSD then reversed down and it is now below yesterday’s low. This is an outside down day. If today closes below yesterday’s low, the EURUSD will then probably break below the bottom of the 3 week trading range next week.<p>Furthermore, if the week closes right around where it is, this week will be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart for a wedge buy climax at the resistance of the September 2018 high. After 8 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart, traders should expect a pullback.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above yesterday’s high and then trended down overnight. Day traders have been selling for a swing down.<p>An outside down day often goes sideways around yesterday’s low. Consequently, today will likely begin to go sideways. If there is a 30 pip bounce, day traders will begin to buy reversals up for scalps. They will switch to scalping shorts from swing trading them.<p>The bears want today to close below yesterday’s low and on the low of the week. The more bearish they can the day and week look, the more traders will expect lower prices next week.<p>The bulls at a minimum will try to get today to close above yesterday’s low. They then would hope that next week would be sideways instead of down. They do not mind a pause in their 4 month bull trend. What they do not want is a 500 pip pullback.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-double-bottom-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-21-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The Emini entered a trading range for several hours. It then rallied from a double bottom bull flag in the middle of the day to a new all-time high.<p>On the weekly chart, 4 of the past 7 bars gapped up, even though only one gap remained open. This week’s close on the high and the number of weekly gaps up increase the chance of another weekly gap up on Monday.<p>It is important to remember that a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars ended last week. Despite the strong weekly close, traders should still expect a reversal down to 3200 to begin by the end of the month.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The pullback should test the breakout point of the March high and possibly the June 100 high. That means the selloff could retrace 500 pips.<p>Today traded above yesterday’s high and triggered a High 1 buy signal. However, the EURUSD then reversed down and it is now below yesterday’s low. This is an outside down day. If today closes below yesterday’s low, the EURUSD will then probably break below the bottom of the 3 week trading range next week.<p>Furthermore, if the week closes right around where it is, this week will be a sell signal bar on the weekly chart for a wedge buy climax at the resistance of the September 2018 high. After 8 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart, traders should expect a pullback.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market traded above yesterday’s high and then trended down overnight. Day traders have been selling for a swing down.<p>An outside down day often goes sideways around yesterday’s low. Consequently, today will likely begin to go sideways. If there is a 30 pip bounce, day traders will begin to buy reversals up for scalps. They will switch to scalping shorts from swing trading them.<p>The bears want today to close below yesterday’s low and on the low of the week. The more bearish they can the day and week look, the more traders will expect lower prices next week.<p>The bulls at a minimum will try to get today to close above yesterday’s low. They then would hope that next week would be sideways instead of down. They do not mind a pause in their 4 month bull trend. What they do not want is a 500 pip pullback.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-double-bottom-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-21-2.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini broke above yesterday’s high to trigger a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart. The Emini entered a trading range for several hours. It then rallied from a double bottom bull flag in the middle of the day to a new all-time high.<p>On the weekly chart, 4 of the past 7 bars gapped up, even though only one gap remained open. This week’s close on the high and the number of weekly gaps up increase the chance of another weekly gap up on Monday.<p>It is important to remember that a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars ended last week. Despite the strong weekly close, traders should still expect a reversal down to 3200 to begin by the end of the month.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

chart with the streak on the daily chart?</a></ul></ul></div></div></div><h2 id=\"0-market-overview-weekend-market-analysis\">Market Overview: Weekend Market Analysis</h2><p>The<strong>S&amp;P500 Emini</strong>futures market might gap to a new all-time high on the weekly chart next week. But the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart that ended 2 weeks ago should lead to a pullback to 3200 starting within a couple weeks.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are bouncing after last week’s selloff. Traders should expect a 2nd leg down to the June 16 low to begin within a couple weeks.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex has a parabolic wedge buy climax for the 2nd leg up to a double top with the September 2018 high. This will probably lead to several weeks of selling to below the March 9 high.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-weekly-chart-should-have-one-more-leg-down\"><strong>Weekly</strong>chart should have one more leg down</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-bad-follow-through-after-bear-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-22.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has bad follow through after bear breakout\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures chart has been sideways for 5 months. Traders expect reversals. When there was a downside breakout in June, the market reversed up the following week. The bull breakout earlier this month reversed down.<p>Last week broke below a 2 month bull channel. While this week did not completely reverse the selloff, it was a bull bar. Traders are unwilling to hold onto positions because they think the trading range will continue. They buy low, sell high, and take quick profits.<p>Last week’s selloff retraced about half of the 2 month rally. The bulls hope it will be just a pullback in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since the June low.<p>Because this week was a bull inside bar, it is a buy signal bar for next week. However, last week fell far below the 2 month bull trend line and this week only erased about half of that selloff. That increases the chance of at least slightly lower prices. You can see the reason for a 2nd leg down on the daily chart below.<h2 id=\"3-bond-futures-daily-chart-has-bear-flag\">Bond futures<strong>daily</strong>chart has bear flag</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bond-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-22-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures daily candlestick chart bear flag\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart rallied in a Spike and Channel Bull Trend since June. The 4 day rally that ended on June 11 was a Spike up. There was a 3 day pullback to the June 16 low. The bull trend continued up for 2 months in a bull channel.<p>Traders expected a break below the bull channel because that is what happens 75% of the time. Next, they look for 2 or more legs down to where the channel began.<p>There has only been one leg down from the August high. Furthermore, the selloff has not gotten close enough to the June 16 low to convince traders that the test down is adequate. Consequently, this week’s rally on the daily chart is probably a bear flag. There should be another leg down to around the June 16 low.<p>At that point, traders will expect a bounce. The bonds bounced there in June. Traders suspect the bonds will do the same this time.<p>The result is that the selloff below the bull channel usually leads to a trading range. That is what typically happens when there is a Spike and Channel trend.<p>Since the entire pattern is within the 6 month range, traders are already expecting more sideways trading, possibly for the remainder of the year.<h2 id=\"4-eurusd-forex-market-stalling-at-september-2018-high-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market stalling at September 2018 high</strong></h2><h2 id=\"5-monthly-chart-has-weak-follow-through-after-strong-july-breakout\"><strong>Monthly</strong>chart has weak follow-through after strong July breakout</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-needs-bull-follow-through-after-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-22-2.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart needs bull follow through after bull breakout.png\"></a></figure><p>On the monthly EURUSD Forex chart, the 2 month selloff in early 2018 was a spike down. The bounce in September 2018 led to a bear channel, and the 2 year bear trend was a Spike and Channel Bear Trend.<p>Traders look for a break above the bear channel and then a rally to where the channel began. That is the September 2018 high.<p>July was a big bull trend bar and it broke above that high. So far, August is a small bull bar. August is the follow-through bar, which always is important after a breakout. Will the breakout continue and lead to a trend, or will it reverse and lead to a trading range?<p>If the August candlestick has even a small bull body, traders will expect sideways to higher prices in September. If it is a big bull candlestick, traders will look for a test of the February 2018 high by the end of this year. That will probably not happen because a Spike and Channel Bear Trend usually evolves into a trading range.<p>If August closes on its low, traders will conclude that the July breakout failed. If August is a strong enough bear bar, traders will wonder if the EURUSD will undo the entire rally and test the March low.<p>August will most likely have either a small bull or bear body, and that will lead to a sideways to down September. The weekly chart below has a couple of reasons to expect lower prices.<h2 id=\"6-eurusd-weekly-chart-is-reversing-down-after-parabolic-wedge-buy-climax\">EURUSD<strong>weekly</strong>chart is reversing down after parabolic wedge buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-wedge-top-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-22-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has wedge top buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart has rallied strongly from the March low. But the rally has had 3 legs up in a tight bull channel. That is a parabolic wedge buy climax, which typically attracts profit takers.<p>This is especially true when the rally is testing important resistance. Here, the rally has stalled at the September 2018 high, which was the start of the 18 month bear channel.<p>This week formed a bear reversal bar. It is a sell signal bar for next week. There is a parabolic wedge rally to a double top with the September 2018 high. That is a common combination that typically results in at least a couple legs down. A measured move down based on the height of the trading range of the past 4 weeks would result in a test of 1.14, which is around the June 10 high breakout point.<h3 id=\"7-reversing-down-from-a-spike-and-channel-bull-trend\">Reversing down from a Spike and Channel Bull Trend</h3><p>The rally after a Spike and Channel Bear Trend typically tests the start of the bear channel. It then stalls and the chart evolves into a trading range. That is what is likely here.<p>The stop for the bulls is far below. They have to reduce their risk and the easiest way to do that is by taking some profits. They will probably begin to take profits over the next few weeks. If enough bulls take profits, there will be a reversal down. Traders expect a test of the breakout points, like the March 9 high and the June 10 high.<h3 id=\"8-streak-of-8-consecutive-bull-bars\">Streak of 8 consecutive bull bars</h3><p>The bulls have an added problem. This rally has been too strong. There are now 8 consecutive bull candles on the weekly chart. That is unusual and therefore unsustainable and a buy climax.<p>The last time that there was a streak of 8 or more bull bars was in 2004. That streak was 11 bull bars. The EURUSD went sideways for a couple months and it then retraced most of the streak.<p>A streak like this in a trading range usually leads to a reversal down and the selloff typically retraces most or all of the streak. This current streak began with the June 26 low of 1.1169.<p>Will there be a selloff this year to that low? Probably not, but there should be a test of at least the March 9 high, which is about 500 pips below this month’s high.<p>Eight bull bars is climactic, but it also tells us that the bulls are aggressive. They will probably buy the selloff, even if it falls 500 pips.<p>It is important to note that it could be sideways for a month or two instead of down. However, after a streak, a market usually retraces at least half of the streak. Traders should expect lower prices.<h2 id=\"9-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"10-monthly-emini-chart-has-5-consecutive-bull-bars\"><strong>Monthly</strong>Emini chart has 5 consecutive bull bars</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-3-year-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-22-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart breaking above 3 year trading range\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has another big bull bar so far in August. However, because of the buy climax on the daily chart (see below), there is an increased chance of a selloff starting in the next few weeks. If it starts in August, this month’s candlestick could look very different once it closes.<p>The bulls have been in control for 5 months. They want August to close on the high of the month and above the July high. That would increase the chance of higher prices in September. But if August closes below the July high, traders will not expect September to be another strong bull bar.<p>If there is a big tail on top of this month’s candlestick, September will probably mostly overlap August. Also, there would be an increased chance that it would close below the open of the month. That would create the 1st bear bar in 6 months.<p>After 5 strong bull bars, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 2 month pullback. The bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can retrace half of the 5 month rally. Consequently, there is not much downside risk for a few months. If there is a sharp selloff in September, the selling would probably end in October. The Emini has a good chance to end the year near the high, even if there is a pullback in September and October.<p>This is true whether Biden or Trump wins the upcoming US election. Presidents are important in many ways, but the political party has no influence on the stock market. The economy is much bigger and much more powerful than whoever is sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office.<h2 id=\"11-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-has-8-week-micro-channel-at-july-high\"><strong>Weekly</strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has 8 week micro channel at July high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-February-high-but-possible-wedge-double-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-22-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart breaking above February high but possible wedge double top\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart again closed near its high. Four of the past 7 weeks gapped up. While only one of the gaps stayed open, this is a sign of eager bulls.<p>With this week closing on the high and at a new all-time high, there is an increased chance of another gap up on Monday. If it is a big gap up, traders will wonder if it might be the start of a new bull trend to far above the 3 year trading range.<p>Will it lead to a 1,000 point measured move up? That is unlikely, but since the market is overbought and the odds favor a pullback, the short side might be crowded. That always increases the chance of the opposite. Therefore, instead of a pullback for a few weeks, there could be a short squeeze up for a few weeks.<p>If the Emini starts to go up, the shorts will buy back their shorts in a panic. Also, many bulls waiting to buy a pullback will be afraid there will be no pullback and they will buy in a panic as well. Consequently, there is an increased potential of a short squeeze next week in addition to an increased chance of several weeks of profit taking.<h3 id=\"12-buy-climax-so-traders-expect-profit-taking-soon\">Buy climax so traders expect profit taking soon</h3><p>The weekly chart has not had a pullback in 8 weeks. An 8 week bull micro channel is a sign of strong bulls. They will probably buy the 1st 2 – 3 week pullback.<p>However, an 8 week micro channel is getting extreme. This is especially true when most of the weeks have had small bodies and prominent tails. A rally with bars that look like that typically soon evolves into a trading range. Also, a rally to an old high usually stalls for several bars. Traders should expect a 2 – 3 week pullback to begin soon. A trading range could develop and last through October.<h3 id=\"13-how-much-of-a-pullback\">How much of a pullback?</h3><p>At a minimum, the Emini will probably fall below the most recent major breakout point. That is the June 5 high of 3220.75. The 3200 Big Round Number is just below and it is a magnet. Traders therefore should expect a test of 3200 in September.<p>Can the selloff reach the bottom of that June 5 week trading range? That trading range came late in a bull trend. It is therefore a reasonable candidate for a Final Bull Flag. The bottom of a Final flag is always a magnet.<p>There is currently a 40% chance of a pullback in the next 2 months to that level, which is around the 3,000 Big Round Number. If the Emini pulls back to the 3200 breakout point, the odds of it continuing down to 3,000 will go up to 50%.<h2 id=\"14-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-chart-had-a-streak-of-9-consecutive-bull-bars\"><strong>Daily</strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-9-consecutive-bull-bar-streak-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-22-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart has 9 consecutive bull bar streak buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended last week. A streak of that length comes every couple years. It is a buy climax and traders should expect profit taking to begin within a couple weeks.<p>There was a streak of 8 consecutive bull bars in June. The Emini fell 9% over the next 5 days.<p>The most recent streak with 9 bars was in January 2018. That rally was stronger than the current rally, and there were 2 more brief legs up after the 1st bear body. This formed a parabolic wedge buy climax. The Emini then reversed down 10% over the next few weeks. It fell below the bottom of the 9 bull bars.<p>How much higher can the Emini go at this point? Since the 9 bars were not especially strong, the Emini will probably not go much higher before correcting. However, it could continue sideways for a week or two more before turning down.<h3 id=\"15-what-are-the-targets-for-the-pullback\">What are the targets for the pullback?</h3><p>One goal for the reversal down is to retrace the most recent buy climax. Traders therefore should expect a test down to the bottom of the 9 consecutive bull bars. That it around 3200. If the Emini dips below, traders will look at the next major higher low as another magnet. That is the bottom of the June trading range at around 3,000.<p>It is important to note that the pullback in June got near the breakout point of the April 29 high, but did not overlap. When there is a subsequent breakout, like in July, and then another pullback, that pullback typically falls below the breakout point. Here the major breakout point is the June 5 high of 3220.75. Traders should expect a test of 3200 before the Emini goes much higher.<h3 id=\"16-how-to-reconcile-the-strong-weekly-chart-with-the-streak-on-the-daily-chart\">How to reconcile the strong weekly chart with the streak on the daily chart?</h3><p>This is one of those situations where the unstoppable force of the weekly bull trend is hitting the immovable object of the buy climax streak on the daily chart. Which is more important? Streaks usually win over everything, but the trend often continues further than what seems likely before reversing. For example, in 2017, there were<a aria-label=\"streaks on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts that were the most extreme in the 100 year history of the stock market (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/trump-corporate-tax-cut-rally-might-be-january-barometer/#buy-climaxes-on-daily-weekly-monthly-charts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">streaks on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts that were the most extreme in the 100 year history of the stock market</a>, and then continued a long time before ending. They lead to the current 3 year trading range.<p>Does the Emini have to pull back after a streak? No, but it usually does, even if it continues up for a couple more weeks first. Remember, the weekly chart is unusually bullish and it might gap up to a new all-time high next week.<p>While the weekly bulls want a 1,000 point measured move up based on the 3 year trading range, there will probably be a pullback on the daily chart first. Also, the odds are that the 3 year trading range will be a magnet for many years. This is true even if the Emini rallies to 4,000 within a couple years.<p>On the daily chart, a gap up next week would be a breakout above a 50 point tall, 8 day tight trading range. Traders would expect some profit taking after reaching a measured move up from that small trading range. The weekly breakout therefore might run 50 points before the bulls take profits and the Emini falls to below the June 5 high. Traders should expect a 5 – 10% correction to start by the end of the month.<h2 id=\"17-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is tilted slightly up. Traders are wondering if the Emini will break far above the February high.<p>Four of the past 7 weeks have gapped up on the weekly chart. Only one of the gaps remained open. However, the Emini is up 28 points an hour before the open and this week will therefore probably be the 5th gap up in 8 weeks.<h3>Streak of 9 consecutive bull bars is a buy climax</h3><p>There was a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended a couple weeks ago. That is an extreme buy climax. Traders should expect a reversal down to the bottom of that buy climax, which is around 3200. But the longer the buy climax continues, the more likely it will be a successful breakout and have at least a couple legs up.<p>A strong trend can go a long way before reversing. There is no sign of a reversal yet. It is important to note that there is a 40% chance of no top from the streak. That means there could be a strong rally from here and a couple legs up before the bears try again.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 28 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above last week’s high.<p>A big gap up increases the chance of a trend day. A bull trend day is more likely.<p>But it also will mean that the Emini is far above the average price on the 5 minute chart. Bulls do not want to pay far above average (the EMA). Therefore, a big gap up has an increased chance of becoming a trading range open.<p>If so, the bulls will wait for the Emini to get closer to the EMA before buying. They will look for a double bottom or wedge bottom near the EMA to buy.<p>The bears know that the bulls will be hesitant to buy far above the EMA on the open. They will look to sell either a double top or a wedge top, expecting at least a test down to the EMA.<p>If there is a trading range open and then a trend, the trend usually does not last all day. This is because the trading range open tells traders that the Emini is around a fair price. That reduces the chance that it will have to go far in a search for fairness.<p>However, 20% of the time when there is a big gap up, the day becomes a big trend day up or down. If that is going to happen, there are usually several consecutive strong trend bars in the 1st 30 minutes.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-double-bottom-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-24.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Because it has had 3 legs up and higher highs and lows, it is also a wedge top. But it is mostly a trading range and therefore a Breakout Mode pattern. There is a 50% chance of measured move up or down.<p>If the bulls get their measured move up, the trading range will probably be the Final Bull Flag. Traders will expect a reversal down within a few weeks, and they will look for a selloff lasting several weeks.<p>If the bears get their downside breakout, traders will expect a test of the breakout points. These are the June 10 and the March 9 highs. There is no sign of an impending breakout. Therefore, traders believe that there is a 50% chance it can go either way. In the meantime, they continue to look for reversals ever few days.<p>While last week is a sell signal bar on the weekly chart, it was the 1st bear bar in 9 weeks. Traders have been so eager to buy that this week might not fall below last week’s low to trigger the the sell signal.<p>Even if the bears trigger the sell signal, the EURUSD has been sideways for 5 weeks in a strong bull trend. The odds are against a major reversal down. The bulls would return within several weeks.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market reversed up from last week’s close, but has been in a 20 pip range for 4 hours. Day traders were buying overnight, but they now are also selling reversals down from the high for scalps.<p>Today’s low is above Friday’s low and today’s high is below Friday’s high. Therefore, today is an inside day after an outside day on Friday. If today closes near its high, it will be a buy signal bar for an ioi bull flag. Traders would then expect at least slightly higher prices tomorrow.<p>Why not expect a resumption of the 4 month bull trend? Because the EURUSD has been in a trading range for a month. Traders know that reversals every few days are more likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-24-2.png\" alt=\"Emini gap up then trading range and late rally\"></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It rallied into the close and today closed near the high.<p>When there is a big gap up, the Emini often goes sideways for 2 – 3 days before traders decide if the breakout will succeed or fail. Today was a trading range day. That increases the chance of another trading range day tomorrow. With the late rally, there might be follow-through buying on tomorrow’s open.<p>If there is a gap down over the next few days, there will be an island top. Island tops and bottoms are usually minor reversal patterns. This is particularly true now because the Emini is also in a strong bull trend. Traders will buy the 1st reversal down, even if it lasts a few weeks.<p>Can the Emini race up from here? Buy climaxes sometimes go a long way before there is profit taking. This buy climax is extreme. That will tend to limit the upside over the next few weeks, despite the gap up to a new all-time high.<p>Remember, there was a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended 2 weeks ago. A rally from there usually ends within a couple weeks.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The bulls want a successful breakout above the 3 year trading range and at least a couple legs up. Today might gap up again, extending the buy climax, which is already stretched.<p>But this gap is late in a 5 month bull trend and at the top of a 3 year trading range. There is therefore an increased risk of a reversal down. This is especially true after the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended a couple weeks ago.<p>When the gap up on the daily chart is big, like yesterday’s was, the Emini often goes sideways for a few days before traders decide whether the breakout will succeed of fail. Yesterday was a trading range day, even thought it rallied into the close. Traders expect another trading range day today. But no one would be surprised by a trend day up or down.<p>If this breakout fails, it could fail with an island top. A gap down this week would create one. Alternatively, it could fail with just a reversal down. Then yesterday’s gap would be an exhaustion gap. For example, if today gaps up and sells off to below yesterday’s low, today would be a big outside down day. That would be an early sign of profit taking.<p>There are 5 trading days left to August. At the moment, August is a big bull bar on the monthly chart. However, a bar often changes just before it closes. It could become a bigger bull bar, or it could have a big tail on top. There will be an increasing chance of a surprisingly big move up or down later in the week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. It might gap up again today. The buy climax on the daily chart is extreme. It includes a streak of 9 consecutive bull days. This increases the chance of a swing down for a few weeks starting at any time.<p>Also, a strong trend often attracts profit taking before a higher time frame bar closes. The candlestick on the monthly chart closes on Monday. That increases the chance of some selling at the end of the month.<p>However, there is no sign of a top yet. Even though a lot of the recent days have been mostly sideways on the 5 minute chart, day traders keep creating bull breakouts, extending the bull trend on the daily chart.<p>Because there is an increasing risk of a sharp swing down, day traders are ready to sell. They are looking for an intraday top, like a midday major trend reversal, or a Bear Trend From The Open. As I said, today could gap up and then sell off to below yesterday’s low. This would create an outside down day. Despite the strong bull trend on the daily chart, day traders will be quick to sell for a swing down if the bears begin to get consecutive big bear bars on the 5 minute chart.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-gap-up-then-trading-range-and-late-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-25.png\" alt=\"Emini gap up then trading range and late rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bulls want a successful breakout above the 3 year trading range and at least a couple legs up. Today might gap up again, extending the buy climax, which is already stretched.<p>But this gap is late in a 5 month bull trend and at the top of a 3 year trading range. There is therefore an increased risk of a reversal down. This is especially true after the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended a couple weeks ago.<p>When the gap up on the daily chart is big, like yesterday’s was, the Emini often goes sideways for a few days before traders decide whether the breakout will succeed of fail. Yesterday was a trading range day, even thought it rallied into the close. Traders expect another trading range day today. But no one would be surprised by a trend day up or down.<p>If this breakout fails, it could fail with an island top. A gap down this week would create one. Alternatively, it could fail with just a reversal down. Then yesterday’s gap would be an exhaustion gap. For example, if today gaps up and sells off to below yesterday’s low, today would be a big outside down day. That would be an early sign of profit taking.<p>There are 5 trading days left to August. At the moment, August is a big bull bar on the monthly chart. However, a bar often changes just before it closes. It could become a bigger bull bar, or it could have a big tail on top. There will be an increasing chance of a surprisingly big move up or down later in the week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 13 points in the Globex session. It might gap up again today. The buy climax on the daily chart is extreme. It includes a streak of 9 consecutive bull days. This increases the chance of a swing down for a few weeks starting at any time.<p>Also, a strong trend often attracts profit taking before a higher time frame bar closes. The candlestick on the monthly chart closes on Monday. That increases the chance of some selling at the end of the month.<p>However, there is no sign of a top yet. Even though a lot of the recent days have been mostly sideways on the 5 minute chart, day traders keep creating bull breakouts, extending the bull trend on the daily chart.<p>Because there is an increasing risk of a sharp swing down, day traders are ready to sell. They are looking for an intraday top, like a midday major trend reversal, or a Bear Trend From The Open. As I said, today could gap up and then sell off to below yesterday’s low. This would create an outside down day. Despite the strong bull trend on the daily chart, day traders will be quick to sell for a swing down if the bears begin to get consecutive big bear bars on the 5 minute chart.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-gap-up-then-trading-range-and-late-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-25.png\" alt=\"Emini gap up then trading range and late rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Yesterday was in a trading range for the 1st 3 hours and then in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. It was follow-through buying after Monday’s gap up on the weekly chart.<p>The monthly candlestick closes on Monday. There is often some profit taking just before any strong trend bar closes. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a 1 – 2 day pullback within the next few days.<p>But traders expect higher prices because the daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Traders will be eager to buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback.<p>If there is a gap down soon, it will create an island top with Monday’s gap up. However, an island top is a minor reversal pattern, especially in a strong bull trend.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is unchanged in the Globex session. Since yesterday was a buy climax, traders expect at least a couple hours of sideways to down trading to begin by the end of the 2nd hour. But there is a 50% chance of some Emini follow-through buying in the 1st 2 hours.<p>Can today be another strong bull day? Of course, especially since the daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Traders will continue to buy one day pullbacks and intraday selloffs. However, most recent days have had a lot of sideways trading. Day traders will expect more again today.<p>It is important to note that while the bull trend on the daily is very strong, it is also extreme. And, remember, there was a streak of 9 consecutive bull days that ended 2 weeks ago. That increases the chance of a surprisingly big, brief profit-taking selloff coming within the next couple weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-double-bottom-then-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-26.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom then small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is a Breakout Mode pattern. The past 4 days have been sideways in the middle of the range. Yesterday was then 2nd of 2 inside bars, so there is an ii Breakout Mode pattern within the trading range. The ii followed an outside bar so the past 4 days formed an ioii Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Today fell 12 pips below yesterday’s low. That triggered a sell signal. But the breakout so far is small and a breakout of a Breakout Mode pattern has a 50% chance of failing.<h3>The open of the month is the key</h3><p>The dominant feature for the EURUSD Forex market is the big July breakout on the monthly chart. August is the follow-through bar. If August has a bull body, traders will expect higher prices over the coming months, even if there is a 1 – 2 month stall or pullback first. But if August has a bear body, traders will wonder is July was simply a strong, brief leg up in a 2-year trading range.<p>Consequently, the EURUSD is hesitating around the open of the month. It might stay here and then decide on Monday whether to close slightly above or below the open of the month.<p>If August has a small bull or bear body, which is likely, September will probably not be a strong trend bar up or down. Traders will expect instead that the EURUSD will work down to the June 10 high, which is the breakout point on the daily chart. The wedge buy climax on the weekly chart (not shown) will probably lead to at least a few weeks of sideways to down trading.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market old off overnight to below yesterday’s low. This triggered the ioii sell signal on the daily chart. The selloff dipped 3 pips below the open of the month, which might be a magnet for the remainder of the month. That means the EURUSD might go sideways here for the remaining 4 trading days in August.<p>The selloff of the past hour was extreme and there is a possible micro double bottom. Since the selloff was probably just a sell vacuum test of the open of the month, there is an increased chance that the EURUSD will enter a trading range for several days.<p>The bears want the selloff to continue down to the low of the month, creating a strong sell signal bar on the monthly chart. But after 4 sideways weeks and the EURUSD now back to where August began, a trading range is most likely.<p>Day traders will sell rallies. If there is a 20 – 30 pip bounce, they will also buy reversals up from around the low. The result will probably be a trading range.<p>The bulls want a sharp reversal up from monthly support and the bears want the plunge to continue down to the low of the month. But the micro double bottom exactly at the open of the month makes a trading range most likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is one of the longest streaks in several years. While climactic, it is also a sign of relentless, eager bulls.<p>The Emini continued yesterday’s strong Small Pullback Bull Trend. There was profit taking late in the day, but the bulls bought into the close and the day closed on the high.<p>This is the strongest consecutive bull days in a long time. While unsustainable and therefore climactic, there is no credible sign of a top on the daily chart. Traders will buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback.<p>Can tomorrow be a 3rd consecutive strong bull day? Probably not. After 2 extremely strong bull days, the bulls will probably begin to take profits on rallies. Also, the bears will look to sell reversals down from the high. This increases the chance of trading range trading tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That increases the chance of a surprisingly big, brief profit-taking selloff coming within the next couple weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-double-bottom-then-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-26.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom then small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

This is a Breakout Mode pattern. The past 4 days have been sideways in the middle of the range. Yesterday was then 2nd of 2 inside bars, so there is an ii Breakout Mode pattern within the trading range. The ii followed an outside bar so the past 4 days formed an ioii Breakout Mode pattern.<p>Today fell 12 pips below yesterday’s low. That triggered a sell signal. But the breakout so far is small and a breakout of a Breakout Mode pattern has a 50% chance of failing.<h3>The open of the month is the key</h3><p>The dominant feature for the EURUSD Forex market is the big July breakout on the monthly chart. August is the follow-through bar. If August has a bull body, traders will expect higher prices over the coming months, even if there is a 1 – 2 month stall or pullback first. But if August has a bear body, traders will wonder is July was simply a strong, brief leg up in a 2-year trading range.<p>Consequently, the EURUSD is hesitating around the open of the month. It might stay here and then decide on Monday whether to close slightly above or below the open of the month.<p>If August has a small bull or bear body, which is likely, September will probably not be a strong trend bar up or down. Traders will expect instead that the EURUSD will work down to the June 10 high, which is the breakout point on the daily chart. The wedge buy climax on the weekly chart (not shown) will probably lead to at least a few weeks of sideways to down trading.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market old off overnight to below yesterday’s low. This triggered the ioii sell signal on the daily chart. The selloff dipped 3 pips below the open of the month, which might be a magnet for the remainder of the month. That means the EURUSD might go sideways here for the remaining 4 trading days in August.<p>The selloff of the past hour was extreme and there is a possible micro double bottom. Since the selloff was probably just a sell vacuum test of the open of the month, there is an increased chance that the EURUSD will enter a trading range for several days.<p>The bears want the selloff to continue down to the low of the month, creating a strong sell signal bar on the monthly chart. But after 4 sideways weeks and the EURUSD now back to where August began, a trading range is most likely.<p>Day traders will sell rallies. If there is a 20 – 30 pip bounce, they will also buy reversals up from around the low. The result will probably be a trading range.<p>The bulls want a sharp reversal up from monthly support and the bears want the plunge to continue down to the low of the month. But the micro double bottom exactly at the open of the month makes a trading range most likely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is one of the longest streaks in several years. While climactic, it is also a sign of relentless, eager bulls.<p>The Emini continued yesterday’s strong Small Pullback Bull Trend. There was profit taking late in the day, but the bulls bought into the close and the day closed on the high.<p>This is the strongest consecutive bull days in a long time. While unsustainable and therefore climactic, there is no credible sign of a top on the daily chart. Traders will buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback.<p>Can tomorrow be a 3rd consecutive strong bull day? Probably not. After 2 extremely strong bull days, the bulls will probably begin to take profits on rallies. Also, the bears will look to sell reversals down from the high. This increases the chance of trading range trading tomorrow.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That reduces the chance of a big selloff. It also reduces the chance of a 3rd consecutive big bull day.<p>What’s left? Trading range price action. The bulls have windfall profits and will take profits on rallies. They will prefer to buy pullbacks than at the market.<p>The bears know that and they will begin to sell reversals down from the high. But they also know that a strong bear trend is not likely and they too will take quick profits.<p>With traders buying selloffs, selling rallies, and taking quick profits, today will likely have a lot of trading range price action.<p>Fed Chairman Powell speaks today (6:10 am PT onwards). There is always the possibility that he will say something that will create a big move up or down. Also, it could last for several days. The risk is greater to the downside because the Emini is in a buy climax and we are at the end of the month when there is often some profit taking.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 6 points in the Globex session. With the exhaustive buy climax of the past 2 days, there is an increased chance of trading range price action today. A trading range began midday yesterday and it might continue today.<p>Also, traders want to hear what Powell has to say. Unlike an FOMC day when traders know there is news exactly at 11 am PST, news from Powell can come at any point in his talk. Like an FOMC day, traders need to be ready for the 1st big move up or down to reverse. Also, they should assume that a big move can be in either direction. Finally, a big trend up or down can reverse after an hour or more. Be prepared for everything and do not be surprised and paralyzed by anything.<p>With the daily chart so overbought, there is an increased risk of a reversal down for several days. However, whenever there is an increased risk of something, there is always an increased risk of the opposite. This is because if something is obvious, there is often a lot of traders already positioned for it.<p>Traders talk about this as a possible crowded trade. There might not be enough others waiting to join in. Then, if their expected move does not happen, they begin to exit. This can result in a panic move in the opposite direction.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-27.png\" alt=\"Emini Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Since Wednesday was a big bull day in a buy climax on the daily chart, yesterday’s pause could be the start of some profit taking. The buy climax is extreme and many bulls will want to reduce their risk. The easiest way is to reduce the size of their positions.<p>This increases the chance of a sideways to down day today. However, with the bull trend on the daily chart as strong as it has been, traders will be eager to buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback.<p>Also, the stock market is in a seasonally bullish window from late August through Labor Day. Therefore, if the bears are going to get their 10% pullback, it might not start until after Labor Day.<p>Today is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want a weekly close above the 3500 Big Round Number. The best the bears can probably do is get a close around the middle of the week’s range. And the odds are against it.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini broke above the 3500 Big Round Number in the Globex session but then entered a trading range. It reversed down and has been in a trading range just below 3500 for 6 hours. The 6 day rally is probably a buy vacuum test of 3500.<p>The bulls will probably test above 3500 in the day session today. But will they create a big breakout to far above that psychological resistance? With the buy climax as extreme as it has been over the past 6 days, many bulls will soon take profits.<p>Also, yesterday was a doji bar on the daily chart. That is a sign of some profit taking. This makes a big bull day today unlikely. Additionally, after 6 bull bodies on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of today closing below the open and forming a bear body. This is particularly true with yesterday having only a 1 tick bull body.<p>But the buy climax means that the bulls are strong. That reduces the chance of a big bear day today. So if today will probably not be either a big bull or bear day, what will traders expect? A lot of trading range trading, like yesterday.<h3>Possible end of the month minor profit taking</h3><p>There are only 2 trading days left in August. August so far is a big bull bar trading at its high on the monthly chart. Most bars on the monthly chart do not close on the high of the bar. There is usually some profit taking at the end of the month, creating a conspicuous tail on the top of the bar. That means there is an increased chance of the month closing at least 20 points down from the high, like it did in April and May.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-double-bottom-and-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-28.png\" alt=\"Emini double bottom and wedge top\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Furthermore, it is a little above yesterday’s high.<p>If today closes above yesterday’s high, then today would be a breakout bar. Traders would conclude that the bulls are resuming their trend. But they need follow-through buying on Monday.<p>The ideal case for the bulls is for today to close on the high of the day and 20 or more pips above yesterday’s high. That would increase the chance that the bull trend is resuming.<p>However, if today closes below yesterday’s high or only a few pips above, traders will wonder if today is just a one day event in the month-long trading range.<p>Monday is important. The bar after a breakout is the follow-through bar. If it has even a tiny bull body, it would increase the chance of higher prices. The bulls want a consecutive big bull bar closing on its high. That would significantly increase the chance of a breakout above the August range. Traders would then look for a 200 pip measured move up.<p>If Monday is a bear bar closing on its low, traders will conclude that the breakout failed. They will then wonder if the EURUSD will quickly break below the bottom of the range and fall for a 200 pip measured move down.<p>The fight today will be over the close. So far, the breakout has been small. The bulls need more. If they do not get it, traders will conclude that the overnight rally is just a small leg in the August trading range.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market rallied early overnight to above yesterday’s high. However, the breakout was small and the EURUSD has been in a 35 pip tall trading range since then. Day traders have switched to scalping reversals up and down for 10 pips.<p>Day traders are focused on yesterday’s high. The bulls hope for a break above the 5 hour trading range and a 35 pip measured move up to far above yesterday’s high. While possible, that is unlikely. When a market rallies to a key price and stalls, it tends to stay there for the remainder of the session. That tendency also reduces the chance of a big reversal down.<p>There are many hours left in the session. Day traders are hoping for a strong buy or sell setup that could lead to a 35 pip measured move above or below the trading range. However, they know the rest of the day is more likely going to be sideways and the day will probably close just a little above or below yesterday’s high.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-28-2.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and weak bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is extreme and therefore a buy climax. But after an 8 bar bull micro channel and a 2 month Small Pullback Bull Trend, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>The week before Labor Day tends to be bullish.

Since Wednesday was a big bull day in a buy climax on the daily chart, yesterday’s pause could be the start of some profit taking. The buy climax is extreme and many bulls will want to reduce their risk. The easiest way is to reduce the size of their positions.<p>This increases the chance of a sideways to down day today. However, with the bull trend on the daily chart as strong as it has been, traders will be eager to buy the 1st 1 – 2 day pullback.<p>Also, the stock market is in a seasonally bullish window from late August through Labor Day. Therefore, if the bears are going to get their 10% pullback, it might not start until after Labor Day.<p>Today is Friday and weekly support and resistance can be important, especially in the final hour. The bulls want a weekly close above the 3500 Big Round Number. The best the bears can probably do is get a close around the middle of the week’s range. And the odds are against it.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini broke above the 3500 Big Round Number in the Globex session but then entered a trading range. It reversed down and has been in a trading range just below 3500 for 6 hours. The 6 day rally is probably a buy vacuum test of 3500.<p>The bulls will probably test above 3500 in the day session today. But will they create a big breakout to far above that psychological resistance? With the buy climax as extreme as it has been over the past 6 days, many bulls will soon take profits.<p>Also, yesterday was a doji bar on the daily chart. That is a sign of some profit taking. This makes a big bull day today unlikely. Additionally, after 6 bull bodies on the daily chart, there is an increased chance of today closing below the open and forming a bear body. This is particularly true with yesterday having only a 1 tick bull body.<p>But the buy climax means that the bulls are strong. That reduces the chance of a big bear day today.

Emini</strong>futures is in a strong bull trend and it should trade higher next week. It might even accelerate up next week. Since the buy climax is extreme, there is a 50% chance of a 10 – 20% pullback starting in September. However, traders will buy the selloff.<p><strong>Bond futures</strong>are selling off to the start of the bull channel on the daily chart. Traders will then expect a bounce and a trading range.<p>For the<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market, August will probably a bull body on the monthly chart and be a good follow-through month. The EURUSD might trade a little higher in the next week or two, but the wedge rally on the weekly chart will probably lead to a test down at some point in September.<h2 id=\"1-30-year-treasury-bond-futures-\"><strong>30 year Treasury Bond futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"2-bond-futures-formed-outside-down-on-monthly-chart\">Bond futures formed outside down on<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-is-tight-trading-range-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-29.png\" alt=\"Bond futures monthly candlestick chart is tight trading range after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The monthly bond futures chart formed an outside down candlestick in August. There is only one more trading day in August. The bears want the month to close below the July low. That would increase the chance of at least slightly lower prices in September.<p>March reversed down from the biggest buy climax in the history of the bond market. Traders are deciding if August was a test of the March high and the start of a bear trend. Alternative, it could be just a pause in the 30 year bull trend before another leg up to a new all-time high.<p>This month was good for the bears. But the bond market has been sideways for 5 months. Unless traders see 2 or 3 consecutive strong trend bars up or down, they will assume that the 5 month tight trading range will continue. After an extreme buy climax, if could continue for 10 or more bars, which means the remainder of the year.<h2 id=\"3-bond-futures-weekly-chart-in-2nd-leg-down-from-double-top\">Bond futures<strong><em>weekly</em></strong>chart in 2nd leg down from double top</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bond-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-2-legs-down-in-tight-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-29-1.png\" alt=\"Bond futures weekly candlestick chart has 2 legs down in tight trading range\"></a></figure><p>The weekly bond futures broke below a 9 week tight bull channel 3 weeks ago. That was a small buy climax and a double top with the April 22 high.<p>Although last week was a bull bar, I said that traders would sell it since they expected a 2nd leg from the buy climax. Furthermore, there was room to the June 16 low, which was a doji bar after a big reversal up. Its low is therefore a magnet.<p>Since this week was an outside down week that closed below last week’s low and there is a magnet below, traders expect at least slightly lower prices next week. If next week is a 2nd consecutive big bear bar closing on its low, traders will look for a test of the March low in September.<p>Sometimes the week after an outside bar is an inside bar. If next week’s low stays above this week’s low and if next week closes near its high, next week will be a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. But because the weekly chart has been in a trading range for 5 months, traders are not expecting a trend up or down. Instead, they are looking for reversals every 2 – 3 weeks.<h2 id=\"4-bond-futures-daily-chart-in-2nd-leg-down-after-spike-and-channel-bull-trend\">Bond futures<em><strong>daily</strong></em>chart in 2nd leg down after Spike and Channel Bull Trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bond-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-has-high-2-double-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-29-2.png\" alt=\"Bond futures daily candlestick chart has high 2 double bottom\"></a></figure><p>The daily bond futures rallied in a Spike and Channel Bull Trend from the June 5 low. June 16 was the 1st pullback after the reversal (spike) up. It was therefore the start of the bull channel. A reversal down from a Spike and Channel Bull Trend typically tests the start of the channel. Therefore the June 16 low is a magnet below.<p>I said that last week’s rally was going to be a bear flag. That is because traders expected a 2nd leg down from the break to far below the bull channel.<p>Also, they know that the reversal usually reaches to around the start of the bull channel. Did this week’s low get close enough? It might have, especially since Friday was a big bull reversal bar closing near its high. It is a buy signal bar for Monday.<p>The bulls have a High 2 buy signal with the August 13 low, and a double bottom with the June 16 low. Traders should expect a reversal up from here or from slightly lower. The 1st target is the August 13 lower high.<p>But whether or not this week is the end of the swing down, traders know that a Spike and Channel Trend typically evolves into a trading range. Consequently, even if the selloff continues to below the June 16 low, traders will look for a leg up in the developing trading range.<p>This is consistent with the weekly and monthly charts already being in trading ranges. Markets have inertia. They tend to continue to do what they have been doing. Therefore, a developing trading range on the daily chart would simply be a continuation of the trading range on the weekly and monthly charts.<h2 id=\"5-eurusd-forex-market-stalling-at-the-september-2018-high-\"><strong>EURUSD Forex market stalling at the September 2018 high</strong></h2><h2 id=\"6-august-is-the-follow-through-bar-on-the-eurusd-monthly-chart\">August is the follow-through bar on the EURUSD<strong><em>monthly</em></strong>chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-monthly-candlestick-chart-has-bull-follow-through-bar-after-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-29-3.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex monthly candlestick chart has bull follow through bar after breakout\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex monthly chart has one day left in August. The EURUSD is trading far enough above the open of the month so that August should have a bull body.<p>July was a big bull bar. This month is the follow-through bar after that breakout. Follow-through bars are important because they often give a clue of what to expect in the next month.<p>If this month were to be a big bull bar closing near its high, traders would expect a test of the February 2018 high by the end of the year. If August was a big bar closing on its low, traders would conclude that the July breakout would fail. They would look for a reversal down, possibly to the March low.<p>Neither of these extremes is likely. Traders expect August to probably have a small bull body. There is a 20% chance of a big selloff on Monday and August ending up with a bear body.<p>If it has a bull body, traders would see that as confirmation of the July breakout. That would increase the chance of at least slightly higher prices in September. Or, if there is a test down in September, they would expect a test back up within a month or two.<h3 id=\"7-pullback-in-spike-and-channel-bear-trend\">Pullback in Spike and Channel Bear Trend</h3><p>The 2 year selloff was a Spike and Channel Bear Trend. For the past year, I have said that there would be a rally to the September 2018 high. This is because that was the start of the channel phase of the pattern, and that is always a magnet.<p>Once there, the chart usually evolves into a trading range. This is what traders should expect over the next several months, even if the EURUSD goes a little high in September.<h2 id=\"8-eurusd-weekly-chart-has-wedge-rally-to-resistance\">EURUSD<em><strong>weekly</strong></em>chart has wedge rally to resistance</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-High-1-bull-flag-after-wedge-top-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-29-4.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex weekly candlestick chart has High 1 bull flag after wedge top buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly chart formed an inside bar this week. It was the 5th consecutive sideways bar and each of the 5 bars had prominent tails.<p>These weeks have been relatively neutral after an extreme 3 month rally. But since this week is a bull inside bar closing on its high, it is a High 1 buy signal bar for next week. That increases the chance of at least slightly higher prices next week.<p>The bulls hope that the strong 4 month rally will soon continue up to the February 2018 high at around 1.25. More likely, it will continue a little higher, maybe for a week or two, but then test down because of the wedge buy climax.<h3 id=\"9-streak-of-8-bull-bars-is-a-buy-climax\">Streak of 8 bull bars is a buy climax</h3><p>The bear bar of 2 weeks ago was the 1st bear bar after a streak of 8 consecutive bull bars. While 8 consecutive bull bars mean the bulls are strong, it is also unsustainable.<p>The last time there were 8 or more consecutive bull bars was in 2004. That streak had 11 bull bars. A streak is a type of buy climax. The market often goes a little higher or sideways afterwards, but it then usually reverses for many bars. Consequently, traders should expect several weeks down beginning sometime in September.<h3 id=\"10-wedge-buy-climax\">Wedge buy climax</h3><p>The 4 month rally has had 3 clear legs up. It is therefore a wedge buy climax. Traders expect at least a couple legs down based both on the wedge and on the streak of bull bars. However, the 3rd leg up was so strong that the bulls might get one more brief leg up in early September before the reversal down begins.<p>A wedge rally to a double top (the September 2018 high) is a common reversal pattern. The bears want a selloff down to the breakout points. These are the June 10 and March 9 highs.<h2 id=\"11-sampp500-emini-futures-\"><strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures</strong></h2><h2 id=\"12-monthly-emini-chart-forming-strong-bull-bar-in-august\"><em><strong>Monthly</strong></em>Emini chart forming strong bull bar in August</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-SP500-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-strong-breakout-to-top-of-expanding-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-29-5.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures monthly candlestick chart in strong breakout to top of expanding triangle\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has one trading day left in August. August will probably remain a big bull bar closing near its high. It is also closing well above the February all-time high. This is a breakout to a new high.<p>Next month is the follow-through bar. It probably will not be another big bull bar. But if it is, traders will expect a continued strong rally to the end of the year.<p>However, if September is a bear bar closing on its low and below the February high, traders will conclude that July was a failed breakout and just a bull trap.<p>The August high is just above the top of the expanding triangle that began in 2017. The bears hope that July is just a buy vacuum test of the top of the triangle. They want a reversal down.<p>But after 5 consecutive strong bull bars, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 2 bar pullback. Consequently, there is not much downside risk on the monthly chart for the remainder of the year. The bears will likely need at least a micro double top before they can get a reversal back to the middle of the 3 year trading range.<h3 id=\"13-august-gapped-up-and-september-might-gap-up-as-well\">August gapped up, and September might gap up as well</h3><p>Gaps on the monthly chart are rare. This is because most days do not gap up. To get a gap on the monthly chart, there must be a gap up on the 1st day of the month. Furthermore, the gap has to be above the high of prior month and not just above the prior day.<p>Despite this, August gapped above July and the gap stayed open. Since August might close near the high of the month, traders should wonder if September will gap up to a new all-time high and above the August high when September begins on Tuesday.<p>A gap up is a sign of aggressive bulls. This 5 month rally has been very strong and traders are chasing it up. Consequently, they might buy a gap up on Tuesday.<p>Most small gaps close before the bar closes. Since this is a monthly chart, if there is a gap, it will probably close before the end of September. However, if it stays open and if September closes near its high, the chance of the rally lasting all year will go up.<h3 id=\"14-what-will-happen-in-september\">What will happen in September?</h3><p>Whenever a market is in a buy climax, there is always the risk of a surprisingly quick, big profit taking selloff. It can come in many ways. For example, September might rally for the 1st half of the month and then sell off in the 2nd half. It would then be a bear reversal bar.<p>Another thought to keep in mind is that September could trade above the August high, maybe even gapping up, but then work its way down to below the August low. September would then be an outside down month.<p>Both of these possibilities would turn September into a sell signal bar on the monthly chart. That could lead to a 1 – 2 bar (month) pullback. However, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top before they can create a bear trend. Traders will buy the 1st pullback, even if it is surprisingly big.<h2 id=\"15-weekly-sampp500-emini-futures-chart\"><em><strong>Weekly</strong></em>S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-SP500-futures-weekly-candlestick-chart-in-strong-breakout-but-possible-exhaustive-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-29-6.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures weekly candlestick chart in strong breakout but possible exhaustive buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart formed its 5th consecutive bull bar this week. Also, there is now a 9-bar bull micro channel. Every low for the past 8 weeks has been above the low of the prior week. This is a sign of very eager bulls.<p>In addition, 5 of the past weeks gapped up. Although 3 of the gaps closed, it is sign of eager bulls. With this week closing near its high, there is an increased chance of another weekly gap up on Monday.<p>But this behavior is extreme and therefore a buy climax. The stop for the bulls is getting far below. Traders are beginning to consider reducing their risk. The easiest way to do this is to take some profits and reduce their position size.<p>It is important to note that the bulls have been eagerly buying above the low of the prior week. Many will be happy to have an opportunity to buy below the low of the prior week. Consequently, if there is some profit-taking, it will probably only last 1 – 3 weeks. Traders will buy the pullback and expect a test back up to the high.<h2 id=\"16-daily-sampp500-emini-futures-strong-august-buy-climax-makes-september-pullback-likely\"><strong><em>Daily</em></strong>S&amp;P500 Emini futures strong August buy climax makes September pullback likely</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-SP500-futures-daily-candlestick-chart-in-strong-breakout-but-possible-exhaustive-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-29-7.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 futures daily candlestick chart in strong breakout but possible exhaustive buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend since June. Traders have been aggressively buying every 1 – 3 day pullback. They will continue to do that until there is a bigger pullback.<p>Sometimes a Small Pullback Bull Trend accelerates up in a blow-off top. This is more common in extremely strong trends, like this one. Therefore, there might be a sharp rally next week, even after the strong 2 month rally. If so, it will probably be the end of this leg up and lead to several weeks of lower prices.<p>A Small Pullback Bull Trend is a sign of very strong bulls. A strong bull trend does not usually reverse into a bear trend without 1st transitioning into a trading range. Therefore, even if there is a surprisingly sharp selloff in the next month or two, traders will buy it.<h3 id=\"17-streak-of-9-consecutive-bull-bars-still-makes-a-10-correction-likely-soon\">Streak of 9 consecutive bull bars still makes a 10% correction likely soon</h3><p>Over the past 2 weeks, I talked about the streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended a couple weeks ago. That many consecutive bull bars is unusual. It is therefore unsustainable and climactic.<p>There was a streak of 8 bull bars in June. It led to a 8% selloff to below the bottom of the streak.<p>The most recent 9 bar streak was 2 1/2 years ago. It became the 1st leg up in a parabolic wedge buy climax. Two weeks later, there was a 10% correction that reversed to far below the start of the streak.<p>There is now a new streak of 7 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart. This is therefore a consecutive buy climax. That increases the chance of a profit taking selloff coming soon. The odds will go up if this 7 day streak extends with a few more bull days.<h3 id=\"18-10-pullback-will-probably-start-in-september\">10% pullback will probably start in September</h3><p>Despite the impressive rally since June, these buy climaxes give the bears at least a 50% chance of a sharp selloff down to the start of the streak beginning in September. The streak began just below 3200. That would be about 10% and comparable to the most recent 2 similar streaks. If the selloff continued down to the June trading range, which is a potential Final Bull Flag, the correction would be 15 – 20%.<p>If the current rally keeps adding bars, these streaks will get pushed further into the past. If there is no pullback within the next several more weeks, these streaks will have lost their influence. The market will then begin to focus on something else.<h2 id=\"19-trading-room\">Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

The daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. The week before Labor Day has a bullish tendency. That reduces the chance that a big selloff will begin today. Even if there is a selloff, traders will probably buy the 1st 1 – 3 day pullback.<p>Five of the past 8 weeks gapped up on the weekly chart. While 3 of the gaps closed, the weekly trend is still strong. With the Emini currently up 5 points in the Globex session, this week might gap up as well.<p>Today is the final trading day in August. So far, August is a big bull bar closing at an all-time high on the monthly chart. The bulls want the month to close near the high. They then will try to get September to gap up on the monthly chart to get consecutive monthly gaps up.<p>Even though the bull trend has been strong, most days have had several hours of trading range price action. Day traders will expect more sideways trading again today. But because of the extreme buy climax, there is a slightly increased chance of a big trend day up or down.<p>There is now a streak of 7 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart. That is getting extreme. It therefore increases the chance of today closing below the open. Also, there was a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended a couple weeks ago. The consecutive buy climaxes increase the chance of a 2 – 3 week selloff in September, and the Emini could fall at least 10%.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 5 points in the Globex session. It therefore might form the 6th gap up on the weekly chart in the past 9 weeks. However, most small gaps close. For example, three of the prior 5 gaps up closed before the end of the week.<p>So far, the Globex session has a bear reversal. It rallied early and it sold off for the past 6 hours. It is now near the session’s low. This is a reversal bar on the Globex daily chart. But remember, the bulls have able to undo anything bearish for 2 months. They will therefore try to get today to close at least above the midpoint of the Globex range. This is especially true because they want September to gap up on the monthly day session chart tomorrow.<p>The daily chart is extremely overbought. Traders should expect at least a 10% correction to begin in September. It can start at any time. But betting that any one day in a Small Pullback Bull Trend will be the start of the selloff is a low probability bet.<p>With most days having a lot of trading range trading, that is what is most likely today. The bulls want a gap up on the monthly chart tomorrow. That reduces the chance of a big selloff today.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-31.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and weak bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

If the bulls break above the August 18 high, there will be a 50% chance of a measured move up. The probability will be higher if they get consecutive closes above that high. This is especially true if the closes are far above.<p>The bears want a breakout below the August trading range and then a test of the June 10 high. They know that even if the bulls get a breakout above the August 18 high, there is a 50% chance that it will fail and the EURUSD will then reverse down. A failed breakout above the wedge would also be a higher high double top.<p>Today is the final trading day in August. August has a bull body on the monthly chart. Since August is the follow-through bar after the July breakout, its bull body makes at least slightly higher prices likely in September. But the daily chart is more important this week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market is trading above last week’s high. It therefore has triggered a weekly High 1 bull flag buy signal.<p>While the EURUSD has rallied 50 pips over the past 4 hours, it has had several legs up and down overnight. A reversal from here would form an expanding triangle with the 2 earlier overnight highs.<p>Last week was a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. Today triggered the buy by going above last week’s high. However, the 4 hour rally is a Spike and Channel bull trend on the 5 minute chart. That typically evolves into a trading range. At the moment, day traders are only buying. But once there is a 20 – 30 pip pullback, they will sell as well.<p>Since a trading range is likely today, the bulls will soon switch to scalping. The EURUSD will probably be in a 30 pip range around last week’s high for the remainder of the session.<p>Can today continue up to above the August high? Yes, but the bars on the 5 minute chart are small and the channel should soon evolve into a trading range. The EURUSD will therefore probably not close at the high of the month.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-nested-expanding-triangles-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-31-2.png\" alt=\"Emini nested expanding triangles at all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today is the last day of the month. The bulls were hoping that the month would close near the high so that September could gap up on the monthly chart tomorrow, like August. But today’s let selloff makes that unlikely.<p>Since today had a bear bar, it ended the current streak of 7 consecutive bull days. There was a 9 day streak that ended a couple weeks ago. Streaks like this usually attract profit, which is likely in September. Traders should expect a 10% pullback to begin in September.<p>There is a small chance that September will be a 6th consecutive bull bull bar on the monthly chart. There is also a small chance that September will trade above the August high and then below the August low and form an outside down month.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is getting extreme. It therefore increases the chance of today closing below the open. Also, there was a streak of 9 consecutive bull bars that ended a couple weeks ago. The consecutive buy climaxes increase the chance of a 2 – 3 week selloff in September, and the Emini could fall at least 10%.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 5 points in the Globex session. It therefore might form the 6th gap up on the weekly chart in the past 9 weeks. However, most small gaps close. For example, three of the prior 5 gaps up closed before the end of the week.<p>So far, the Globex session has a bear reversal. It rallied early and it sold off for the past 6 hours. It is now near the session’s low. This is a reversal bar on the Globex daily chart. But remember, the bulls have able to undo anything bearish for 2 months. They will therefore try to get today to close at least above the midpoint of the Globex range. This is especially true because they want September to gap up on the monthly day session chart tomorrow.<p>The daily chart is extremely overbought. Traders should expect at least a 10% correction to begin in September. It can start at any time. But betting that any one day in a Small Pullback Bull Trend will be the start of the selloff is a low probability bet.<p>With most days having a lot of trading range trading, that is what is most likely today. The bulls want a gap up on the monthly chart tomorrow. That reduces the chance of a big selloff today.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-wedge-bottom-and-weak-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-31.png\" alt=\"Emini wedge bottom and weak bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. I do not want the lines to be distracting. If they are longer, I make them dotted. But, they have to be visible, so I make the shorter ones solid. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day (see Online Course/BTC Daily Setups).<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<p class=\"caption\">If the risk is too big for your account, you should wait for trades with less risk or trade an alternative market like the Micro Emini.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EURUSD-Forex-testing-wedge-top-for-measured-move-up-or-down.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-31-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex testing wedge top for measured move up or down\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the daily chart is testing the top of the August wedge. If the bulls break above the August 18 high, there will be a 50% chance of a measured move up. The probability will be higher if they get consecutive closes above that high. This is especially true if the closes are far above.<p>The bears want a breakout below the August trading range and then a test of the June 10 high. They know that even if the bulls get a breakout above the August 18 high, there is a 50% chance that it will fail and the EURUSD will then reverse down. A failed breakout above the wedge would also be a higher high double top.<p>Today is the final trading day in August. August has a bull body on the monthly chart. Since August is the follow-through bar after the July breakout, its bull body makes at least slightly higher prices likely in September. But the daily chart is more important this week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market is trading above last week’s high. It therefore has triggered a weekly High 1 bull flag buy signal.<p>While the EURUSD has rallied 50 pips over the past 4 hours, it has had several legs up and down overnight. A reversal from here would form an expanding triangle with the 2 earlier overnight highs.<p>Last week was a buy signal bar on the weekly chart. Today triggered the buy by going above last week’s high. However, the 4 hour rally is a Spike and Channel bull trend on the 5 minute chart. That typically evolves into a trading range. At the moment, day traders are only buying. But once there is a 20 – 30 pip pullback, they will sell as well.<p>Since a trading range is likely today, the bulls will soon switch to scalping. The EURUSD will probably be in a 30 pip range around last week’s high for the remainder of the session.<p>Can today continue up to above the August high? Yes, but the bars on the 5 minute chart are small and the channel should soon evolve into a trading range. The EURUSD will therefore probably not close at the high of the month.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><p>I will post chart after the close.<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Emini-nested-expanding-triangles-at-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2020-8-31-2.png\" alt=\"Emini nested expanding triangles at all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today is the last day of the month. The bulls were hoping that the month would close near the high so that September could gap up on the monthly chart tomorrow, like August. But today’s let selloff makes that unlikely.<p>Since today had a bear bar, it ended the current streak of 7 consecutive bull days. There was a 9 day streak that ended a couple weeks ago. Streaks like this usually attract profit, which is likely in September. Traders should expect a 10% pullback to begin in September.<p>There is a small chance that September will be a 6th consecutive bull bull bar on the monthly chart. There is also a small chance that September will trade above the August high and then below the August low and form an outside down month.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
