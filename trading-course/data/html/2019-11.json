It was an outside up month on the monthly chart. Traders see it as a buy signal bar for November. By closing above both the September and July highs, the Emini has a better chance of higher prices in November.<p>But if the bears can prevent November from breaking above the October high, November might become a sell signal bar for December. The momentum up on the daily, and weekly charts favor at least slightly higher prices in November.<p>Yesterday sold off on the open after Wednesday’s FOMC rally. It then entered a trading range around the open of the week. That could be a magnet all day, especially in the final hour. If the week closes below the open, this week will be a bear bar on the weekly chart. Traders would see it as a sell signal bar for a failed breakout above the July all-time high.<p>After 3 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart, there is a 50% chance that this week will have a bear body. If the bears can get the week to close on its low, it would be a stronger sell signal bar. However, after 3 bull weeks, there probably will be buyers not too far below.<p>There are many magnets around the open of the week. This include the September and July highs and the 60 minute EMA. With 4 sideways days this week, there is an increased chance that today will be mostly sideways and stay around these magnets. However, the bulls will try to break above the November high to trigger a monthly buy signal.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 12 points in the Globex session. The bulls want a break above Wednesday’s high, which is the October high. That high is only a point or so above the current Globex price. The momentum up is strong on all time frames and the bulls will probably achieve their goal today or next week. Today might even gap above the October high.<p>The bears want the week to close below Monday’s open. That is about 17 points below the October high. If the Emini day session opens where it is trading in the Globex session, it will be below the October high. The bears will try to prevent the Emini from triggering the monthly buy signal. They will try to create an early reversal down.<p>If the bulls break above the October high and trigger the buy signal, the bears will try to make it fail. They would again try for an early reversal down.<p>Whether or not the bulls trigger the monthly buy signal, the open of the week could be a magnet at the end of the day. Unless the Emini is 10 or more points above the 3033.25 open of the week in the final hour, day traders should be ready for an attempt by the bears to create a late selloff to below the open of the week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Emini-parabolic-wedge-sell-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-1.png\" alt=\"Emini parabolic wedge sell climax\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-after-FOMC-ahead-of-Brexit.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-1-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top after FOMC ahead of Brexit\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD daily Forex chart has a double top with the October 21 high. The bears want a break below the October 25 neck line and then a measured move down to the October 15 buy climax low.<p>However, there have been 4 bull bars this week and the 13 month bear trend line is a magnet above. In addition, yesterday was a bull doji bar and that is a weak sell signal bar. Therefore, the chart is not clearly bullish or bearish.<p>That increases the chance of more sideways trading as traders wait for clarity. Will the EURUSD test the bear trend line? It probably will at some point in November. Will it fall below the October 25 neck line? It will probably do that as well. Traders are now deciding which it will do first. It might have to go sideways for another day or two before they form an opinion.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD 5 minute Forex chart sold off from yesterday’s close on today’s open. Twenty minutes ago, it broke below yesterday’s low, but the breakout was only 3 pips. That triggered the sell signal on the daily chart. But the context and sell signal bar are weak. Also, a 3 pip breakout is weak as well. There is a lack of conviction so far today.<p>The bears want today to close below yesterday’s low. That would create a strong bear bar on the daily chart and increase the chance of lower prices next week.<p>They need follow-through selling after the small selloff from 20 minutes ago. If they get more selling over the next hour, today could become a bear trend day. But the hesitation over the past 20 minutes reduces their chances.<p>The bulls instead want a reversal up from below yesterday’s low. But the lack of buying in the overnight session make a strong rally unlikely. This is especially true after yesterday formed a doji bar on the daily chart. The odds are against a strong rally today.<p>Today is Friday. This week is a bull inside bar on the weekly chart. It is a buy signal bar for next week. It would be a stronger buy signal bar if the week closed near the high of the week. That is unlikely. Instead, today will either continue down at least a little more or be another trading range day.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-1-2.png\" alt=\"Emini broad bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Gaps on the monthly chart are rare. This one will probably close before the end of the month. Less likely, it might take 5 – 10 months to close. Today was a good day for the bulls.

It will probably work higher for at least another month.<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong>reversed up strongly 2 weeks ago but had a bear follow-through bar on the weekly chart this week. There will probably be buyers below this week’s low. However, Bitcoin will likely be in a trading range for many months.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>weekly Forex chart formed a High 1 bull flag buy signal this week. It will probably trade up next week. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that it will test the June high within a couple months.<h2><strong>Bitcoin weekly chart: Bear rally or bull trend resumption?</strong></h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Bitcoin-weekly-chart-pullback-from-strong-reversal-up-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-2.png\" alt=\"Bitcoin weekly chart pullback from strong reversal up\"></a></figure><p>The Bitcoin weekly chart broke strongly below a 3 month triangle in September. In July and August, I said that the bulls wanted to buy below the June buy climax low, not at 10,000. I therefore said that the 10,000 support would not hold and that there would be a test down to below 7,500. The September selloff was that test.<p>When there is a breakout below a triangle, there typically is a pullback to the apex of the triangle. At that point, traders decide if the bear trend will resume or if the pullback in fact is the start of a bull trend reversal.<p>Part of the decision involves an assessment of the strength of the rally back to the triangle. The rally 2 weeks ago on the daily chart was surprisingly strong. A bull Surprise Bar typically has at least a small 2nd leg up. Consequently, the bulls will probably buy this week’s selloff. There will likely be buyers below this week’s low. Traders should expect at least a test of the top of the rally from 2 weeks ago.<p>If there is a strong break above that high, the October low will probably remain the low for the next few months. Also, the bulls would have a reasonable chance of the rally continuing up to any of the lower highs since the June top.<h3>Bear case is currently not strong</h3><p>The bears hope that this week will be a credible sell signal bar. They want the rally from 2 weeks ago to be a bull trap and just a test of the apex of the triangle. They know that there will probably soon be a test of the October high. If they can get a reversal down at that point, they will have a micro double top. That would give them a better chance of breaking below the October low and down to the 6,000 bottom of the 2018 trading range.<h3>Confusion is a hallmark of a trading range</h3><p>What is likely over the next few weeks? Bitcoin will probably trade below this week’s low. It might go sideways to down for several weeks like it did after the December 23, 2018 reversal up. However, there is enough confusion and uncertainty to limit the upside and downside for a couple months and maybe many months.<p>When traders do not expect a big rally or a big selloff, they take quick profits. The result is usually a trading range. The bottom of the range is now around the October low. However, it might expand down to 6,000, which was the bottom of the 2018 range. While 10,000 might be the top, the top more likely will be around the June through August highs at around 12,000.<h3>Trading range more likely than bull trend</h3><p>What is most likely to happen? A mess. That means a trading range, and it could be taller and last longer than what traders want. The lack of a 2nd consecutive big bull trend bar this week created uncertainty. Compare it to the follow-through bars of other strong rallies on the chart. This week’s hesitation reduces the chance that this rally will be like the others.<p>There is currently a 50% chance that the bottom of the range will be around 6,000. The bulls only have a 30% chance that this rally is the start of a bull trend up to 20,000. Any rally will probably have a hard time breaking above 12,000 where Bitcoin has reversed down repeatedly over the past 2 years. I think that the 2017 blow-off top was also simply a failed breakout above 12,000.<p>The daily chart will probably test the high from 2 weeks ago. The test could happen next week. But there could be a deeper pullback that could last a few weeks first.<p>If there is a strong reversal down from a micro double top with the October high, traders will look for a deeper pullback, like down to the 6,000 bottom of the 2018 trading range. Alternatively, if the rally breaks strongly above the high, traders will expect a test of the September or August highs at around 12,000. In either case, Bitcoin will probably not be able to break below 6,000 or above 12,000 for at least 6 months.<p>It is too early to conclude that the low is in and that the bull trend is resuming. A trading range is always more common than a trend. The daily chart went sideways just above 10,000 for several months. If it gets back above 10,000, there is a good chance that it will go sideways again for at least several weeks. Traders should expect a trading range over the next 6 – 12 months. The bottom will probably be between 6,000 and 7,500 and the top will be between 10,000 and 12,000.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>High 1 bull flag with room above to bear trend line</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-High-1-bull-flag-buy-signal-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-2-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex High 1 bull flag buy signal bar\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart rallied strongly for 3 weeks, but pulled back last week. This past week formed a bull inside bar. It is therefore a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for next week.<p>After the strong rally, the bulls expect at least a small 2nd leg up. An obvious target is the bear trend line that began in September 2018. It is currently at 1.1214, which is only 40 pips above this week’s high.<p>A more important target is the June major lower high of 1.1413. If the bulls can get a couple consecutive closes above that high, traders will conclude that the bear trend has converted into a trading range and possibly a bull trend.<h3>EURUSD monthly Forex chart has minor reversal up</h3><p>The monthly chart<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"(I posted it last weekend) (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-outside-up-monthly-chart-october-fomc/\" target=\"_blank\">(I posted it last weekend)</a>has not had 2 consecutive strong bull bars since the selloff began in February 2018. However, the selloff is still holding above the 2017 low. Since that was the bottom of a strong yearlong rally, the 21 month selloff is still probably a bull flag.<p>But the bear channel has been tight. When that is the case, any reversal attempt will likely be minor. That means that it could last a few bars (months), but the EURUSD would probably then test back down.<p>The bulls typically need at least a small double bottom before they can convert a bear trend into a bull trend (a major trend reversal). Until there is a double bottom, traders will assume that the rally is minor. They will see it as either a bull leg in the bear trend or in a developing trading range.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Emini triggered monthly outside up buy signal with gap above October high</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-monthly-candlestick-chart-gapped-up-above-outside-up-bar.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-2-2.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly candlestick chart gapped up above outside up bar\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart in October traded below the&nbsp;September low and then above its high. October was therefore an outside up bar, which is a sign of strong bulls. Furthermore, it closed above the September high. That is even better for the bulls. Finally, it closed above the July all-time high. Therefore, October had the all-time highest close on the monthly chart. Traders should expect higher prices over the next few months.<h3>Can November form a sell signal bar?</h3><p>An outside up bar in a bull trend is a buy signal bar. The buy signal triggered on Friday when the Emini gapped above the October high. But if November then reverses down, November would become a sell signal bar for December.<p>Gaps on the monthly chart rarely stay open. Consequently, the Emini will probably trade back below the October high at some point this month. The gap might take 5 – 10 bars (months) to close.<p>It is important to note that the monthly and weekly charts are strongly bullish. If November forms a sell signal bar on the monthly chart, there will probably be buyers below. Traders should expect higher prices for at least another month or two.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Breakout to new high, testing top of expanding triangle</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-weekly-candlestick-chart-strong-breakout-to-new-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-2-3.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly candlestick chart strong breakout to new all time high\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart had its 4th consecutive bull trend bar this week. It closed on its high and at a new all-time weekly high. Traders will buy the 1st reversal down. They expect higher prices over the coming weeks.<p>There is a 22 month expanding triangle top on the weekly (and monthly) chart. This week broke slightly above the upper line. While the line might cause some hesitation, it is not strong enough resistance to abruptly stop the rally. The bears will need at least a micro double top before traders will look for shorts on the weekly chart. Traders expect the Emini to trade sideways to up for the next several weeks.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Small Pullback Bull Trend</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-daily-candlestick-chart-in-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-2-4.png\" alt=\"Emini daily candlestick chart in small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart gapped up to a new all-time high on Friday. In addition, it closed on its high. The October rally is accelerating now that the Emini is breaking above the 22 month trading range.<p>Every pullback for the past month lasted only a day or two. This is a Small Pullback Bull Trend. Higher prices over the next few weeks.<p>Bull trends do not go straight up forever. There will always be profit-taking that will cause a pullback. Sometimes the selloff can be strong enough to reverse the trend.<p>However, this rally is accelerating up in a parabolic curve. The bears have to stop it from continuing up before they can make it reverse down. That is a process that takes time. At a minimum, the bears typically need at least a micro double top, which takes a few days to develop.<p>But even that is usually not enough to reverse a bull trend. The bulls will buy the 1st reversal down, even if it is surprisingly strong. Most tops require a double top and not just a micro double top. The double top usually takes weeks to form. Consequently, the downside risk over the next few weeks is small.<p>What happens if the Emini gaps down some day next week? Yes, there would be an island top, but most island tops are minor reversal patterns. Traders should expect the Emini to be higher than it is now in a month and probably in 2 months.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This was a gap up on the monthly chart as well as on the daily chart. Gaps on the monthly chart rarely stay open. Consequently, there will probably be a pullback below Thursday’s high soon. But “soon” could be 5 – 10 bars, which is many months on the monthly chart.<p>October was an outside up bar in a bull trend on the monthly chart. Friday triggered the buy signal by going above the October high. Traders therefore expect higher prices over the next month or two.<p>What about today? Friday was a bull bar on the daily chart and it broke above the 21 month trading range. The bulls need follow-through buying to convince traders that the breakout will succeed. They should get it this week. However, when the Emini breaks above major resistance, it often soon goes sideways for a day or two before continuing up.<p>The bears want the breakout above the July high to fail. But they will need a good sell signal bar on the daily chart before traders will consider that possibility. That means the bears need one or more days closing near their lows.<p>Even if they get it, the trend up is strong on all time frames. Traders will buy the 1st reversal down. There is not much downside risk over the next few weeks.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 18 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up on the day session. With last week’s gap up on the monthly chart and the strong breakout on the weekly chart, the Emini should work higher for a month or two. When there is a strong breakout, there is an increased chance of bull days closing near their highs on the daily chart. As a result, traders expect either a bull trend day or a late reversal up with today closing near its high.<p>A bull breakout is a buy climax. Profit taking can begin at any time. Day traders therefore will be ready for an occasional bear trend day. But with the higher time frame charts in a bull breakout, even if there is a 3 hour selloff on the 5 minute chart, there is an increased chance of a late rally. The odds are against a strong bear trend day.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-broad-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-4.png\" alt=\"Emini broad bull channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

It is a buy signal bar for this week. Today got to within a fraction of a pip of going above last week’s high and triggering the buy signal, but instead reversed down.<p>On the daily chart, a reversal down from here would form a double top with the October 21 high. I have been saying that last week’s rally lacked consecutive big bull bars. It therefore was more likely to be a bull leg in a developing trading range than the start of a bull trend. If today closes near its low, today will be a sell signal bar for the double top.<p>Will the bear trend resume? Since this rally was the strongest one on the weekly chart since the bear trend began 22 months ago, the bears will probably not be able to get a new low for many weeks. More likely, any selloff over the next few weeks will end up as a bear leg in the trading range that began on October 1.<p>Since the EURUSD daily Forex chart is again stalling just below 1.12, this is a credible top of the range. But the bear trend line and the August highs are only 70 pips above the double top. Consequently, even if tomorrow goes below today’s low and triggers the double top sell signal, the selloff might be brief. There might be enough bulls below to continue the rally up to the next resistance level before there is a test of the October 25 low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD 5 minute Forex chart sold off on the open of the European session from just below last week’s high with 3 big bear bars. That is a credible high of the day. While the 5 minute chart bounced after that selloff, the chart has been in a 20 pip range since. Day traders have been scalping. The objective for the bears is a close near the low. They do not need today’s range to get any bigger. Therefore, there is a lack on an incentive to create a big bear day.<p>The bulls want today to go above last week’s high to trigger the weekly buy signal. But the lack of energy so far makes a big bull trend day unlikely as well. The bulls will be satisfied by simply having the day close 10 – 20 pips above they low. They do not want the bears to have a strong sell signal bar on the daily chart. If the bulls succeed, there would be an increased chance of buyers overwhelming sellers tomorrow below today’s low.<p>With so much trading range price action for 2 weeks and not much incentive for either a big rally or selloff, today will probably remain a trading range day. The bull day traders will buy near the low and try to get today to close above the middle of the range. The bear day traders will sell rallies and try to get today to close near its low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-broad-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-4-2.png\" alt=\"Emini broad bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was sloped downward and it was also a broad bear channel. Traders are still debating when and if Friday’s gap up on the monthly chart will close. There has been a 1 – 2 day pullback every 3 – 5 days for a month. Traders should see another one this week.<p>But there are 4 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart. That represents sustained buying. Consequently, the bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day selloff. Therefore the down side risk is small this week.<p>There is a seasonally bullish tendency at the end of October into November 5 and another one that starts on November 11. Placing trades based on seasonal behavior is a losing strategy. I mention it because it can be fun to see if it holds true this year. Remember, November through May is already a seasonally bullish time, and all time frames are currently in bull trends. The seasonal windows add nothing other than entertainment.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 7 points in the Globex session. Traders are wondering if the rally will reach 3100 before there is a pullback. Whether or not it does, they expect a 1 – 3 day pullback beginning today or tomorrow. This is because there has been a pullback after every few days in this 5 week rally. Also, the past 3 days have been climactic. Finally, yesterday was a bear day on the daily chart.<p>The Emini might gap above yesterday’s high. But if it does, the gap will likely be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour. Furthermore, yesterday’s range was small. If there is an early selloff, there is an increased chance of an outside down day, especially since a pullback is likely this week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-broad-bear-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-5.png\" alt=\"Emini broad bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-nested-double-top-at-bear-trend-line-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-5-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex nested double top at bear trend line\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD daily Forex chart is turning down from a small double top with the October 21 high. This small double top is nested within a bigger double top with the August 26 high. Also, the rally is a truncated wedge, which means the 3rd leg up did not go above the 2nd. It began with the September 13 high. Traders expect 2 legs sideways to down over the next couple weeks.<p>Most traders believe that the October 25 low was not a deep enough test of the October 1 low. Consequently, the developing selloff will likely fall below the October 25 neck line of the small double top.<p>But this rally was the strongest one on the weekly chart in almost 2 years. Therefore, the selloff should form a higher low and lead to one more test up. The target is another test of the August 26 high and a test of the 13 month bear trend line.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD 5 minute chart continued yesterday’s selloff overnight. It fell 40 pips in a tight bear channel.<p>While the bars were not big and the bear trend did not fall far, the bear channel is still tight. Therefore, the bulls will need to stop the selling and then create a trading range before day traders will begin to buy. Also, a tight bear channel usually evolves into a trading range before it can reverse into a bull trend. Consequently, the bulls will only look for scalps today.<p>While the selloff has been relentless, it is not particularly strong. Also, the EURUSD is reaching the support of the October 25 low. Traders know that there will probably be a bounce around that level.<p>That is only 27 pips below the overnight low. As a result, while the bears will continue to sell 10 pip rallies, they will start to scalp for 10 pips. They do not believe that the selloff will accelerate down strongly through that support. The bounces will probably increase to 20 pips as the weak bear trend transitions into a trading range today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bear-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The last 2 pullbacks in the 5 week rally lasted 2 days. Consequently, this pullback will either continue tomorrow for a 2nd day or there will be a 1 – 3 day rally and then a 2 – 3 day pullback. With today closing near its low, tomorrow will probably trade below today’s low. There would then be a 2nd pullback day.<p>The downside risk this week is small because the 5 week rally has been so strong.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It was sloped downward and it was also a broad bear channel. Traders are still debating when and if Friday’s gap up on the monthly chart will close. There has been a 1 – 2 day pullback every 3 – 5 days for a month. Traders should see another one this week.<p>But there are 4 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart. That represents sustained buying. Consequently, the bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 3 day selloff. Therefore the down side risk is small this week.<p>There is a seasonally bullish tendency at the end of October into November 5 and another one that starts on November 11. Placing trades based on seasonal behavior is a losing strategy. I mention it because it can be fun to see if it holds true this year. Remember, November through May is already a seasonally bullish time, and all time frames are currently in bull trends. The seasonal windows add nothing other than entertainment.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 7 points in the Globex session. Traders are wondering if the rally will reach 3100 before there is a pullback. Whether or not it does, they expect a 1 – 3 day pullback beginning today or tomorrow. This is because there has been a pullback after every few days in this 5 week rally. Also, the past 3 days have been climactic. Finally, yesterday was a bear day on the daily chart.<p>The Emini might gap above yesterday’s high. But if it does, the gap will likely be small. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour. Furthermore, yesterday’s range was small. If there is an early selloff, there is an increased chance of an outside down day, especially since a pullback is likely this week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-broad-bear-channel.png\"><img src=\"2019-11-5.png\" alt=\"Emini broad bear channel\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-nested-double-top-at-bear-trend-line-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-5-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex nested double top at bear trend line\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD daily Forex chart is turning down from a small double top with the October 21 high. This small double top is nested within a bigger double top with the August 26 high. Also, the rally is a truncated wedge, which means the 3rd leg up did not go above the 2nd. It began with the September 13 high. Traders expect 2 legs sideways to down over the next couple weeks.<p>Most traders believe that the October 25 low was not a deep enough test of the October 1 low. Consequently, the developing selloff will likely fall below the October 25 neck line of the small double top.<p>But this rally was the strongest one on the weekly chart in almost 2 years. Therefore, the selloff should form a higher low and lead to one more test up. The target is another test of the August 26 high and a test of the 13 month bear trend line.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD 5 minute chart continued yesterday’s selloff overnight. It fell 40 pips in a tight bear channel.<p>While the bars were not big and the bear trend did not fall far, the bear channel is still tight. Therefore, the bulls will need to stop the selling and then create a trading range before day traders will begin to buy. Also, a tight bear channel usually evolves into a trading range before it can reverse into a bull trend. Consequently, the bulls will only look for scalps today.<p>While the selloff has been relentless, it is not particularly strong. Also, the EURUSD is reaching the support of the October 25 low. Traders know that there will probably be a bounce around that level.<p>That is only 27 pips below the overnight low. As a result, while the bears will continue to sell 10 pip rallies, they will start to scalp for 10 pips. They do not believe that the selloff will accelerate down strongly through that support. The bounces will probably increase to 20 pips as the weak bear trend transitions into a trading range today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bear-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-5-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

This is because there has been a pullback every few days in the 5 week rally. With Monday being the 3rd day up and having a bear body, it was a good candidate to begin a pullback.<p>Will Tuesday be a 1 day pullback? The 2 most recent pullbacks lasted 2 days. Also, yesterday closed near its low. Therefore, today will probably trade below yesterday’s low and be the 2nd day in the pullback. If today has a bear body, there would then be 3 consecutive bear days on the daily chart. The bears will then begin to sell above the bear bars, betting that the Small Pullback Bull Trend might be evolving into a tight trading range.<p>Since yesterday was a pullback, it is a buy signal bar for today. But it had a bear body and it was the 2nd consecutive bear day. That is a weak buy setup. There will probably be sellers above and around 3100.<p>Many bulls want the rally to reach the 3100 Big Round Number before they take some profits. Since the rally is climactic and there will be profit-taking around 3100, the rally will likely begin to have more sideways trading this week.<p>After 4 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart, the downside over the next couple weeks is small. But 4 weeks is a lot. There probably will be a 1 – 2 week pullback at some point in November.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably open in the middle of yesterday’s range.<p>The Emini has had 2 trading range days. While today might be a 3rd, the 2 days are probably forming a bull flag. Also, the Emini will probably test 3100 before there is a test down to below the October high.<p>But 2 sideways days late in a bull trend usually becomes the Final Bull Flag. There will probably be a deeper 1 – 2 week pullback at some point in November.<p>Remember, gaps are rare on the monthly chart. Traders should expect an attempt to close this month’s gap up this month. Therefore, if the Emini tests 3100 within the next week, there will then probably be at least a 50 point selloff within a couple weeks.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bear-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-6.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

The bears want a measured move down and then a break below the October low. This reversal down would then be a resumption of the 22 month bear trend.<p>However, the October rally was the strongest rally in almost 2 years on the daily chart. Traders will therefore buy around a 50% pullback. Also, there is a cluster of resistance above the double top at around 1.12. Those magnets will probably draw the EURUSD up within a couple months.<p>Finally, if today is a bull day on the daily chart, it would be a buy signal bar for tomorrow. There would be a High 2 buy signal because of a reversal up from the 2nd leg down from the October 21 high. Traders would wonder if the 2 day selloff was a bear trap and if the month-long rally will resume this week.<p>The 2 bear days are big enough so that at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down is likely. However, traders should expect a move up to 1.12 within a couple months.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD 5 minute Forex chart reversed up overnight from below the October 25 neckline of the double top on the daily chart. Because the rally has been only 25 pips and it followed 2 big bear days, today will probably not be a big bull day. But is is enough to make a big bear day unlikely.<p>The bulls want a bull body and a close above the October 25 low. They will buy 10 – 20 pip selloffs today. They do not need the day to become any bigger. If is simply closes near its high, it would be a credible buy signal bar for tomorrow.<p>The bears want follow-through selling after yesterday’s breakout. That would increase the chance of lower prices over the next couple weeks. They want today to close near its low. Furthermore, they want today to break below yesterday’s low and close below yesterday’s low.<p>With the number of bull bars closing near their highs on the 5 minute chart overnight, the bears will probably not be able to achieve their goals. As an alternative, they want today to not close near its high and be a credible buy signal bar for tomorrow. They therefore will look to sell rallies.<p>But, since there were so many bull bars overnight, the bears will likely only scalp. They know that they will probably not be able to get today to close on its low and below yesterday’s low.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-failed-breakout-above-and-below-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-6-2.png\" alt=\"Emini failed breakout above and below triangle\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Traders know that the bull trend on the daily and weekly charts is strong and there is no clear top. The Emini has already pulled back for a couple days. That was enough to make the bulls buy again. Today was a bull reversal day.<p>But because the 4 week rally is extreme, traders should expect a 2 week pullback this month. It will probably begin within a week after a test of 3100.

The day reversed up and it is a buy signal bar for today on the daily chart.<p>Traders expect a test of 3100. However, the rally is climactic. Therefore there will probably be a 1 – 2 week pullback soon. It might be underway already, but the Emini will more likely test 3100 first.<p>Since a gap up on the monthly chart is rare, the pullback will probably fall below the October high and close the gap. However, the bull trend is strong. Traders should expect higher prices after the Emini closes the gap.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>I said yesterday that yesterday would have a bull body on the daily chart and become a High 1 buy signal bar for today. I also said that there would probably be a test of 3100 before there is a 2 week pullback. The Emini is up 12 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above yesterday’s high. That will trigger the buy signal on the daily chart.<p>A big gap up increases the chance of a trend day. If there is a trend, up is more likely than down.<p>With so much trading range price action over the past few weeks, today will probably not form a strong trend. Traders should expect a lot of sideways trading even if today is a trend day.<p>However, the daily chart is in a buy climax and 3100 is a psychological barrier. Consequently, traders should expect a test down to the October high to begin within a week. The rally might go 20 points above 3000 before the pullback begins. But the probability is now shifting in favor of some profit taking after 4 strong weeks up.<p>A reasonable target would be a test of the October high of 3049. If there is a pullback, it will probably fall below that high and close the gap on the monthly chart. Traders will buy the pullback.<p>The yearlong rally and the rally of the past month make higher prices likely for at least the remainder of the year.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-failed-breakout-above-and-below-triangle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-7.png\" alt=\"Emini failed breakout above and below triangle\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

But there has been no follow-through selling. This is consistent with the chart being in a 2 month trading range. Traders should expect disappointing follow-through and reversals instead of the start of a strong trend up or down.<p>Because the chart is in a trading range, the week-long selloff will probably have to test down more toward the middle of the range. A reasonable target is the October 15 low, which is around a 50% pullback from the October rally.<p>Since that rally was the strongest one on the daily chart in almost 2 years, traders should expect a 2nd leg up. Consequently, bulls will soon look to buy either around the current level or the October 15 low.<p>A trading range is a breakout mode pattern. There is always both a buy and sell setup. The bears see these 2 months as a big bear flag. They expect a bear breakout at some point. The lack of follow-through selling over the past 2 days is a sign that the current selloff is more likely just a bear leg in the range and not a resumption of the 22 month bear trend.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>Yesterday was a small trading range day. It was a Low 1 sell signal bar on the daily chart. Today traded below yesterday’s low and therefore triggered the sell signal.<p>Yet, the EURUSD soon reversed up. There were more buyers than sellers below yesterday’s low and below last week’s low. Today is therefore forming a micro double bottom with Tuesday’s low.<p>The bulls want today to close near its high. It would then be a buy signal bar on the daily chart. They would see a High 2 bull flag with the October 25 low. In addition, this would be a higher low major trend reversal.<p>While they might get a resumption of the October rally from here, the 2 day selloff was surprisingly strong. Consequently, there is confusion. That typically results in more sideways trading. Traders should expect a 50 pip trading range that will last today and tomorrow. Day traders will scalp for 10 – 20 pips unless there is a strong breakout up or down on the 5 minute chart.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bear-sell-signal-bar-near-3100-big-round-number.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-7-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear sell signal bar near 3100 big round number\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Also, the Emini is testing the 3100 Big Round Number. Consequently, there will probably be a pullback to between 3000 and 3050 that begins within a week or so.<p>Will today be the top? It might be, but many bulls will wait to take profits until after the Emini breaks above 3100 or until the Emini begins to accelerate down.<p>The upside over the next week is small. But, even if the bears get their 2 week pullback, the bulls will buy it, expecting another new high before the end of the year.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

This will probably continue through the end of the year. But the rally has been climactic. That will probably attract profit takers within a couple weeks. If so, traders should expect a 50 – 100 point selloff and then a resumption of the bull trend.<p>The 30 year Treasury<strong>bond futures</strong>monthly chart is putting in a high that will probably last 20 years. But because the bull channel is tight, the current leg down will probably soon stall. The chart would then likely go sideways for a few months.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market has been in a bear trend for 2 years. There has not been consecutive strong bull trend bars on the monthly chart at any point. However, the October rally on the weekly chart was strong enough to lead to a continuation the 3 month trading range for at least another month.<div id=\"30-yr-bonds-mkt-rising-interest-rates-next-20-years\"><h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond futures market:</strong><br>Rising interest rates for next 20 years</h2></div><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Bond-futures-ii-sell-signal-and-higher-high-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-10.png\" alt=\"Bond futures ii sell signal and higher high major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures market is continuing its collapse. A couple months ago, some pundits on TV were saying, “Gold to infinity, interest rates to zero.” At the time, I said that this was nonsense and that just because something sounds clever does not make it true. It holds the interest of the TV audience and sells commercials, but it misleads the public.<p>I have been saying for 5 years that the bond market was putting in a major top that will probably last 20 years. There were nested wedges on the monthly chart at the July 2016 high. Also, I said that because the top is on the monthly chart, it might take years to complete. The 2019 rally was a test of that high. It is probably part of the topping process. The 3 month reversal down is a higher high major trend reversal top.<p>This year broke above the 2016 nested wedge top. It is common for a wedge top to have a bull breakout and then a 2nd reversal down. When that happens, the probability is high that there will be a significant reversal down.<h3>ii monthly sell signal triggered in November</h3><p>There is an ii (inside-inside) sell signal bar setup that triggered this month. October was an inside bar and it was inside of September’s range, which was also inside bar. When November fell below the October low, it triggered the ii (consecutive inside bars) sell signal.<p>The bulls want November to close on its high. It would then be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for December.<p>However, the bears have a reliable top. If December goes above the November high, there will likely be more sellers than buyers up there. The best the bulls can probably get over the next several months is a trading range.<p>At the moment, there is a 60% chance that the August high will be the top for the next 20 years. But the parabolic wedge rally from the October 2018 low was in a tight bull channel. Therefore, there is a 40% chance that there will one more new high before the bear trend begins. That high, if it comes, will probably be brief.<h3>What is the 1st target for the bears?</h3><p>The 1st targets after a buy climax typically are the 20 bar EMA and the bottom of the final leg up in the buy climax. On the monthly chart, that is the big bull bar in August. Its low is 154 6/32. When the market gets there, it is usually also around the EMA as well.<p>Furthermore, traders should expect at least a couple legs sideways to down. Since this is a monthly chart, that would require at least several more months.<p>A tight bull channel does not suddenly reverse into a bear trend. Therefore the 3 month selloff will probably enter a trading range within a few months. That trading range could last 5 – 10 bars, which means a year. The bulls will see it as a bull flag. But since there is a reliable top, it more likely be the 1st pause in a new bear trend.<div id=\"Interest-rates-cannot-go-to-zero-in-the-US\"><h3>Interest rates cannot go to zero in the US</h3></div><p>Can interest rates go to zero in the US, like so many pundits have been predicting? No, I do not believe so. This is because there already is a credible top in the bond market and therefore a bottom in interest rates.<p>More importantly, that is not how America works. Having zero interest rates is simply un-American. America sees itself as the leader of the world. Our heritage of capitalism is something that makes Americans particularly proud.<p>Most Americans would see zero interest rates as a sign of unacceptable failure on the part of our leaders. America borrows money (sells bonds) and the lenders (bond buyers) get nothing in return for helping us out? No, that is just too unfair and therefore un-American and too embarrassing.<p>Is America that cheap and selfish? Have we mismanaged our economy so badly that the world is now frightened of economic collapse? The politicians and the captains of industry know people are wondering about zero interest rates, and I cannot imagine them ever letting it happen.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>1 – 2 week pullback likely</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-bear-flag-and-micro-double-top-in-bear-channel-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-10-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top bear flag and micro double top in bear channel\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart rallied for 3 weeks and then pulled back two weeks ago. The next week formed a bull bar closing on its high. That was High 1 bull flag buy signal bar.<p>This past week had to go above the high of that bull bar to trigger the weekly buy signal. It could not. Instead, it reversed down from within a fraction of a pip of the top of the bull bar. This is a sign of weak bulls and strong bears.<p>This week then traded below the low of the bull bar. There is now a micro double top on the weekly chart at the 20 week EMA in a 22 month bear trend. Furthermore, this week is now a sell signal bar for next week. The bears are hoping that the 2 year bear trend is resuming.<h3>Only minor reversal and not bear trend resumption</h3><p>The 3 week rally in October was the strongest leg up on the weekly chart since the bear trend began in February 2018. I have talked about this regularly in my daily updates. Traders should expect around a 50% retracement down from the 3 week rally. This selloff might test the September lows, which was support.<p>The bulls will probably soon buy again and that will start a 2nd leg sideways to up. Therefore the selloff will probably only last 2 – 3 weeks before the bulls return. But the best they probably will achieve is a continuation of the 3 month trading range for another month or so.<p>In my<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"October 26 weekend update (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/analysis/emini-outside-up-monthly-chart-october-fomc/\" target=\"_blank\">October 26 weekend update</a>, I discussed the monthly chart. I made the point the bulls have been unable to create 2 consecutive strong bull bars at any point in the past 22 months. That makes that it difficult for the bulls this time as well.<p>However, if the bulls buy around a 50% pullback or a test of the September lows on the daily chart, that could lead to another month or two of sideways to up trading. That is what currently is the most likely result.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Gap above October high will probably close this month</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-monthly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-July-all-time-high-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-10-2.png\" alt=\"Emini monthly candlestick chart breaking above July all time high\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has a bull bar so far in November. Furthermore, November gapped above the October high.<p>Gaps rarely stay open on the monthly chart. Most close before the end of the month. Consequently, traders should expect a pullback to below the October high before the end of November.<p>But if the bulls can keep the gap open and get the month to close on its high, the rally might continue for 5 – 10 months before the gap closes.<p>Can the gap stay open forever? No. The monthly chart is in a buy climax and it is 10 years into a bull trend. Even if it rallies for several years from here, which is unlikely, the odds are high that there would be a pullback that closes the gap. Most likely, it will close in November. If not, then probably in the 1st half of next year.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>2 week pullback should begin within a couple weeks</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-weekly-candlestick-chart-buy-climax-so-1-week-pullback-soon.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-10-3.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly candlestick chart buy climax so 1 week pullback soon\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has rallied for 5 weeks. This is getting extreme. Many bulls will begin to take some profits within a week or two. That profit taking will create a 1 – 2 week pullback. A pullback means that the low of a bar is below the low of the prior bar.<p>This week was a doji bar. That is a sign of a loss of momentum and some profit taking. It increases the chance of a pullback beginning next week or the week after.<p>However, after a 6 bar bull micro channel, the bulls will buy that pullback. Traders should expect higher prices through the end of the year.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Consecutive parabolic wedge tops so November pullback likely</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-daily-candlestick-chart-in-small-pullback-bull-trend-but-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-10-4.png\" alt=\"Emini daily candlestick chart in small pullback bull trend but buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is in a small pullback bull trend. Friday was a 1 day pullback and it closed near its high. It is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for Monday.<p>The 3100 Big Round Number is an obvious magnet and the bull trend is strong. Consequently, the Emini will probably break above 3100 early next week.<p>But it is important to see that there are now consecutive parabolic wedge tops over the past month. These are small and therefore minor buy climaxes, but they typically attract some profit-taking. Consecutive attempts at a top have a higher probability of leading to a pullback.<p>Also, many bulls are likely looking to take some profits above the resistance of 3100. Moreover, after a 5 week rally on the weekly chart, there will probably be a weekly pullback either next week or the week after.<p>Finally, the rally is similar to the rallies in late February, April, July, and September. Each led to sharp selloffs for a couple weeks. Yet, the bulls bought each selloff. Traders should expect something similar soon. However, it probably will be shorter and shallower than the June selloff.<p>Can the Small Pullback Bull Trend continue through the end of the year? Yes, but the consecutive parabolic wedge buy climaxes make a 1 – 2 week pullback likely first. While the odds favor higher prices, there will probably be a 50 – 100 point pullback at some point in November.<h3>Minor reversal down to October high</h3><p>Because the 5 week bull channel is tight, a reversal down should be minor. But a climax usually has at least a couple small legs down. That will require a week or two.<p>The selloff might retrace half of the October rally and close the gap above the October high. Another target is the October 31 low. That is the 1st pullback in the 2nd wedge rally. The start of a wedge is always a magnet in a reversal. Traders should expect a 50 – 100 point pullback to begin within a couple weeks.<p>As I said, traders should expect the selloff to be minor. That means a bull flag and not a bear trend. They should look to buy a reversal up after a week or two and expect a new all-time high. The resumption of the bull trend could last through the end of the year.<h3>What about those Bear Surprise Bars on the 5 minute chart?</h3><p>If you are a day trader, you have noticed about a half dozen unusually big bear bars on the 5 minute chart over the past month. For example, many bear breakouts have fallen 5 or more points in 1 second! The bar on the 5 minute chart ends up being about 10 points tall, which is very big compared to the prior bars.<p>Whenever a low probability event happens, it is a surprise. An unusually big bear or bull bar or series of bars is a Surprise Bar or Breakout. It traps traders into bad positions and out of good ones. That results in traders untrapping themselves on 1st pullback. That typically leads to at least a usually at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down.<p>None of the Bear Surprises had significant follow-through. This is because the bull trend is so strong on the daily and weekly charts. Traders see each sharp selloff as a brief discount and they eagerly buy.<h3>Expect a Bear Surprise Bar on the daily chart this month</h3><p>You may have noticed that over the past month there have also been many Bear Surprise Bars on the 60 minute chart. None had follow-through selling because the bulls were eager to buy the brief sale.<p>What might happen in the next 2 weeks is that this pattern could appear on the daily chart. There were several examples of big bear bars in late September.<p>A Bear Surprise Bar on the daily chart could create a 30 – 50 point selloff in a single day. After a bounce, there would likely be at least a small 2nd leg down. But like on the 5 and 60 minute charts, traders will see it as a brief sale and the bulls will buy it. Traders should expect a resumption of the bull trend after a week or two of selling. This is true even if the selling is surprisingly strong.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Friday is now a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today in a strong bull trend on the daily chart.<p>Because the rally is extreme on the daily and weekly charts, the bulls will probably take some profits in November. This will create a 1 – 2 week pullback of 50 – 100 points. There are now consecutive small parabolic wedge tops on the daily chart, which usually will lead to a pullback. Look at late February, April, and July for similar rallies, but I suspect the pullback will not be as deep this time.<p>However, the bull trend is strong. Traders will see the selloff as a buying opportunity. The Emini will probably work higher through the end of 2019.<p>Did the profit-taking begin on Thursday? It might have, but it is still more likely that the rally will have to get above the 3100 Big Round Number first. Many bulls want to take some profits above that resistance. However, many will begin to take profits just below. If enough do, the Emini will have begun the 2 week pullback last week. In either case, the odds favor a brief pullback soon and then a resumption of the rally through the end of the year.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 12 points in the Globex session. Traders are deciding if last week was the temporary end of the rally on the daily chart. Has the Emini begun a 2 week leg down, like in March, May, August, and September? Because one will probably start in November, there is an increased chance of bear trend days this week.<p>However, most days over the past month have had a lot of trading range price action. Until there is a clear strong bear trend on the 5 minute chart, day traders will expect mostly trading range price action every day.<p>What about the buy signal on the daily chart? Even if it were to trigger today, the upside is probably small until after a 2 week pullback. Rallies often end with a buy climax. Friday’s strong rally is a reasonable candidate. The bears hope it was simply a buy vacuum test of Thursday’s all-time high.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bull-trend-reversal-and-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-11.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal and bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

Trading ranges have strong legs up and down, as do channels, but most reverse.<p>Also, the October rally was the strongest one on the weekly chart in the 2 year bear trend. Consequently, last week’s selloff will probably not lead to a resumption of the bear trend. More likely, a bull leg will begin within a couple weeks.<p>The selloff has been strong. Therefore the bulls will probably need a micro double bottom or a small double bottom. This is the opposite of what happened with the strong October rally. The bears needed a small double top 2 weeks later before they could take control.<p>But if there are consecutive big bear bars closing below the October low, then traders will consider the possibility that the rally has ended. Without that, the bulls will probably soon buy this selloff and the bears will take profits. Both know that a leg up is likely before there is a strong break below the October low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD 5 minute Forex chart overnight traded a fraction of a pip below last week’s low, but then reversed up. The reversal has been small, but the absence of a strong selloff below last week’s low means that traders are buying below things. That is a characteristic of a trading range. Day traders will continue to look for reversals.<p>The overnight low was from a wedge bottom on the 4 hour chart. Traders will expect a couple legs of sideways to up trading early this week. They will buy 20 – 30 pip pullbacks and look for 10 – 20 pip scalps.<p>The bears see that the reversal up has not yet been strong. They therefore will also look for scalps.<p>Both however, believe that the rally will get above the October 25 low of 1.1073. That is because it is the breakout point of the double top. Rallies in trading ranges typically go above resistance before there is profit-taking.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-11-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was a bull bar on the daily chart and it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. Many bulls are waiting to take profits above 3100. Therefore 3100 is a magnet above.<p>The bulls are continuing to buy small pullbacks, expecting a breakout above 3100 this week. The momentum up is strong enough to make it likely. However, the odds are that the Emini will pull back for a couple weeks at some point in November, just as it has after 4 other rallies this year. The other pullbacks were 5 – 8%. This one will probably be less because of the 5 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart. The bears will probably need a micro double top before they can get more than a 50 – 100 point pullback.<p>The 5 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart is extreme. It increases the chance of a bear bar this week. To get that, the week would have to close below yesterday’s open. Therefore the open of the week might be a magnet all week, especially on Friday.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is unchanged in the Globex session. It is just below the 3100 Big Round Number. There is therefore an increased potential for a strong breakout or a strong reversal.<p>After 2 bull days on the daily chart, The Emini will likely go above yesterday’s high and trigger the High 1 bull flag on the daily chart. But a rally to a new high would be the 3rd small leg up in the past 7 days. That would increase the chance of a reversal down from a micro wedge top within a few days.<p>Also, the past 2 days formed a triangle on the 5 minute chart. A triangle late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. That is another reason to expect a break above 3100 to reverse down.<p>Finally, this week will probably not form the 6th consecutive bull bar on the weekly chart, which would be unusual. As a result, traders should expect the week to close below the open of the week to create a bear bar on the weekly chart.

It was a bull bar on the daily chart and it is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. Many bulls are waiting to take profits above 3100. Therefore 3100 is a magnet above.<p>The bulls are continuing to buy small pullbacks, expecting a breakout above 3100 this week. The momentum up is strong enough to make it likely. However, the odds are that the Emini will pull back for a couple weeks at some point in November, just as it has after 4 other rallies this year. The other pullbacks were 5 – 8%. This one will probably be less because of the 5 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart. The bears will probably need a micro double top before they can get more than a 50 – 100 point pullback.<p>The 5 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart is extreme. It increases the chance of a bear bar this week. To get that, the week would have to close below yesterday’s open. Therefore the open of the week might be a magnet all week, especially on Friday.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is unchanged in the Globex session. It is just below the 3100 Big Round Number. There is therefore an increased potential for a strong breakout or a strong reversal.<p>After 2 bull days on the daily chart, The Emini will likely go above yesterday’s high and trigger the High 1 bull flag on the daily chart. But a rally to a new high would be the 3rd small leg up in the past 7 days. That would increase the chance of a reversal down from a micro wedge top within a few days.<p>Also, the past 2 days formed a triangle on the 5 minute chart. A triangle late in a bull trend is often the Final Bull Flag. That is another reason to expect a break above 3100 to reverse down.<p>Finally, this week will probably not form the 6th consecutive bull bar on the weekly chart, which would be unusual. As a result, traders should expect the week to close below the open of the week to create a bear bar on the weekly chart. Consequently, traders should expect at least a small selloff at the end of the week.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open.png\"><img src=\"2019-11-12.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Therefore, traders should expect a selloff to below the open of the week by Friday’s close.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Yesterday gapped down and triggered the sell signal, but then rallied for 4 hours. There was a late selloff but it was a bear trap. The Emini reversed back up to near the high of the day. It is therefore a buy signal bar for today.<p>However, there will probably be a 1 – 2 week pullback that starts in November. Therefore, the bulls might wait for the pullback before aggressively buying again.<p>The Emini has been unable to break strongly above 3100. This is disappointing the bulls. If they do not get their breakout soon, they will exit. Their long covering could be the start of a 2 week correction.<p>Tomorrow is Friday. If the Emini closes above Monday’s open, there will be 6 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart. That is unusual and therefore extreme. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a selloff to below the open of the week by tomorrow’s close.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 7 points in the Globex session. This is despite yesterday being a buy signal bar on the daily chart. Since it has been stalling at 3100 for 5 days, there is an increased chance of more sideways trading again today.<p>The weekly buy climax is getting extreme. There is therefore an increased risk of several bear trend days and a 2 week pullback beginning this month. The bulls might get one more brief new high before the pullback begins, but the bears will likely soon be in control.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bull-trend-resumption.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-14.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend resumption\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That is a micro wedge sell climax and it could attract some profit taking for a few days. Additionally, it is testing the support of the October 15 low. That was the bottom of the final buy climax in the October rally.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the 5 minute chart overnight has again been in a tight range. This is what it has been doing for 6 days, even though it has been drifting lower.<p>Because the EURUSD is now at important support, it will soon either reverse up or break to the next support at the October low. But since the bear channel is tight, the bulls will need it to go sideways for a day or two.<p>Since the bars on the daily chart have been small, it will probably not break to the downside without forming a small bear flag. That means the bears need it to go sideways as well.

The Emini is still going up and it might accelerate. Until midday yesterday, this week was likely to sell off to below the open of the week. That changed. Instead, the week will probably close near its high. Traders expect higher prices next week.<p>The top of the bull channel on the weekly chart is around 3120. Strong trends tend to overshoot before pulling back. Buy climaxes can go a long way before there is profit taking.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 10 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap up today. A big gap up has an increased chance of leading to a trend day. When the gap is up, if there is a trend, up is more likely.<p>However, when the Emini gaps far above the 5 minute EMA, many bulls are hesitant to buy far above that average price. This usually results in some trading range price action over the 1st hour or two. The bulls often wait for a double bottom or wedge bottom near the EMA before betting on a bull trend.<p>If there is an opening trading range, the bears will want to see either a double top or a wedge top. They will sell it and hope for a bear trend.<p>A trading range open is a sign of balance. If there then is a trend up or down, it usually is not as strong as a trend that begins from the 1st bar. There is always a 20% chance of either a bull or bear trend from the open on any day. When there is a big gap up, there is an increased chance that a trend will be strong.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bull-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-15.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend reversal\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That typically leads to a 2 legged rally. The start of the 2nd leg up is often the right shoulder of a head and shoulders bottom. That is a type of a higher low major trend reversal. Major reversal setups have a 40% chance of a trend up. The bulls are hoping that this will happen here.<p>More often, either the trading range continues or the bear trend resumes. However, the bulls bought every new low for 2 years. Therefore, even if the bears get their new low, it will probably reverse up and create another 1 – 2 month bear rally in the 2 year bear channel.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>Yesterday was a buy signal day for a higher low major trend reversal on the daily chart. Today broke above yesterday’s high and triggered the buy signal.<p>But instead of racing up and beginning a bull trend, the 5 minute chart so far only has had a 30 pip range overnight. This is because the 2 week bear channel has been tight. Many bulls are waiting to buy. They want to see either a micro double bottom over the next few days or a strong breakout above the 2 week bear channel.<p>However, there is plenty of time left in the day. The weak overnight rally could become strong if enough traders begin to think that a 2nd leg up is starting on the daily chart.<p>Can today be a bear trend day? Probably not. Today is reversing up from a 5 day micro wedge at support on the daily chart. Additionally, it is near the bottom of the 4 month trading range. Finally, yesterday was a bull trend reversal day. This combination makes a bear trend day unlikely today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-weak-bull-trend-to-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and weak bull trend to all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That typically leads to a 2 legged rally. The start of the 2nd leg up is often the right shoulder of a head and shoulders bottom. That is a type of a higher low major trend reversal. Major reversal setups have a 40% chance of a trend up. The bulls are hoping that this will happen here.<p>More often, either the trading range continues or the bear trend resumes. However, the bulls bought every new low for 2 years. Therefore, even if the bears get their new low, it will probably reverse up and create another 1 – 2 month bear rally in the 2 year bear channel.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>Yesterday was a buy signal day for a higher low major trend reversal on the daily chart. Today broke above yesterday’s high and triggered the buy signal.<p>But instead of racing up and beginning a bull trend, the 5 minute chart so far only has had a 30 pip range overnight. This is because the 2 week bear channel has been tight. Many bulls are waiting to buy. They want to see either a micro double bottom over the next few days or a strong breakout above the 2 week bear channel.<p>However, there is plenty of time left in the day. The weak overnight rally could become strong if enough traders begin to think that a 2nd leg up is starting on the daily chart.<p>Can today be a bear trend day? Probably not. Today is reversing up from a 5 day micro wedge at support on the daily chart. Additionally, it is near the bottom of the 4 month trading range. Finally, yesterday was a bull trend reversal day. This combination makes a bear trend day unlikely today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-weak-bull-trend-to-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-15-2.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and weak bull trend to all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

After 6 consecutive bull bars, a 1 – 2 week pullback will probably begin in November.<p>The<strong>bond</strong>futures market triggered a parabolic wedge buy climax sell signal on the monthly chart in November. It will probably go sideways for several months.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is trying to reverse up from a head and shoulders bottom (higher low major trend reversal) on the weekly chart. A 2nd leg up is likely after the October wedge bottom,<h2>30 year<strong>Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Weak breakout below an ii sell signal bar on monthly chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Treasury-bond-futures-monthly-candlestick-chart-entering-trading-range-after-buy-climax.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-16.png\" alt=\"Treasury bond futures monthly candlestick chart entering trading range after buy climax\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures contract in November on the monthly chart broke below the October low. This means that the breakout above the August high might be failing.<p>August was a big bull trend bar and it broke above a 10 year nested wedge top. September did not confirm the breakout. Instead it was a big bear bar and an inside bar. An inside bar means that its high was below the August high and its low was above the August low.<p>October was then inside of September. Consecutive inside bars is a breakout mode pattern. Climaxes often reverse when there is an ii Breakout Mode pattern.<p>November broke below the October low and that triggered the sell signal. November is therefore the entry bar. But instead of a big bear bar closing on its low, it is currently trading up in the middle of its range. Furthermore, it is back at the October low. This is not a strong bear trend reversal.<h3>Problems with the ii top</h3><p>There are 2 additional problems with this reversal down. First, both inside bars had prominent tails and did not close near their lows. This is a sign of hesitation. It represents uncertainty. Uncertainty typically results in several sideways bar, giving traders time to make up their minds about the direction of the next move.<p>The 2nd problem is that the 2019 parabolic wedge buy climax was in a tight bull channel. That rarely quickly reverses into a bear trend. Much more often, the chart goes sideways for 5 – 10 bars before the next leg up or down begins.<p>Both of these factors make a trading range likely for 5 – 10 months. Is November the bottom of the range? Ten bars is a long time. November will probably not be the bottom.<h3>Possible Final Bull Flag</h3><p>What happens if there is a trading range? It is in a bull trend, and a bull breakout usually is more likely.<p>But the context weakens that argument. Here, a nested wedge has been forming for 10 years. August is a breakout above that wedge. So far, the breakout is failing.<p>Since a nested wedge top is an unusually reliable pattern, traders should expect a reversal down. The ii after the August failed breakout is a good candidate for the start of the reversal down from the high.<p>But if the monthly chart goes sideways for a year, the bulls might get one more brief new high. It will probably fail and the trading range would then be the Final Bull Flag. Traders should still expect a 20 year bear trend in bonds.<p>I have said many times that a 30 year bull trend might take years to reverse. Nothing has changed. Traders should conclude that either August will be the top or that there will be one more brief new high for the final top. Americans will not allow interest rates to fall to zero, which means that bonds should not go much higher.<h3>November might become a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar</h3><p>If November closes near its high, it will be a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar. If December goes above the November high, it would trigger the buy signal.<p>But a reversal down after a buy climax usually has a 2nd leg sideways to down. Consequently, a rally above the November high would probably only last a month or two. Traders will sell above the November and August highs, betting against another strong leg up.<p>They believe that the strong bull trend is evolving into a trading range. They will sell rallies, like above the November or August highs. They will also buy selloffs, like below the October low.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>High 2 bull flag in 4 month trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-candlestick-chart-forming-head-and-shouders-bottom-and-higher-low-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-16-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex candlestick chart forming head and shoulders bottom and higher low major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD Forex market on the weekly chart has been in a bear trend for 2 years and in a trading range for 4 months. Last week was a big outside down week, but this week did not have follow-through selling. It is a reversal up from a higher low after a small 2 legged pullback from the October high.<p>What is more likely? Is the bear trend resuming or will the bulls get a 2nd leg sideways to up after the October rally? The 3 week October rally was the strongest rally on the weekly chart in the entire bear trend. Furthermore, it followed a nested wedge bottom. Traders should expect a 2nd leg up.<h3>Minor buy signal</h3><p>This week is a buy signal bar for a higher low reversal. Since the legs up and down on the weekly chart only lasted a few bars, the reversal up will probably be minor. However, it might be major on the daily chart. A minor reversal means that a rally would more likely be a leg in a trading range than the start of a bull trend.<p>Remember, markets have inertia. They resist change. The EURUSD weekly chart has been sideways for 4 months. Traders will look to buy selloffs and sell rallies.<p>The current selloff is now in the buy zone, which is the bottom third of the 4 month trading range. This week is a buy signal bar for next week. If the EURUSD reverses up, traders will expect a test of resistance. That is the October high and the top of the 14 month bear trend line. Both are around 1.12.<p>If a rally continues, the next target is the June major lower high just above 1.14. If there are consecutive closes above that high, traders will conclude that the bear trend has ended. They would then think that the chart is now either simply in a trading range or the early stage of a bull trend.<h3>Monthly chart has tight bear channel</h3><p>There have not been consecutive bull trend bars on the monthly chart (not shown) since the bear trend began almost 2 years ago. This is a strong bear trend. Since the bear channel on the monthly chart is tight, the 1st rally on that chart will probably be minor. That means it could last a few months. Traders would then look for a test back down.<p>A 2nd reversal up at that point would have a better chance of leading to a major trend reversal up and a test of the start of the bear channel. That is the September 2018 high just above 1.18.<p>There would also be a higher low major trend reversal on the monthly chart. A major reversal usually results in a trading range, but there is a 40% chance of it growing into a bull trend. That means a test of the February 2018 high above 1.2550.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Late in oo buy signal</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-strong-bull-breakout-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-16-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart in strong bull breakout\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;is still rallying from the June oo buy signal. There were consecutive outside bars (outside-outside, or oo) in June. That is a breakout mode pattern.<p>Since the monthly chart has been in a bull trend, those bars formed an oo bull flag. July triggered the buy signal by going above the June high. The minimum objective was 3 months of sideways to up trading. But it is important to note that the breakout usually does not last much more than about 5 bars. November is now the 5th month. So far, there is no sign of a top.<p>At the moment, November is a bull trend bar trading at the high of the month. If it looks like this at the end of the month, traders will expect at least slightly higher prices in December. The next target is the top of the 12 year bull channel at around 3,175. There are different channels on the weekly and daily charts and those have lower targets.<h3>Next pullback likely to be minor</h3><p>If November reverses down and closes on its low, November would be a sell signal bar for December. It would be a reversal down from the 3rd leg up from the Christmas 2018 low and therefore a small wedge top.<p>But the yearlong bull trend has been strong. If there is a reversal down in the coming months, it will probably be similar to the 3 minor reversals in 2019. Each lasted only 1 or 2 bars (months).<p>This would be the 4th pullback. Trends tend to weaken as they age. Therefore, the next reversal might last a couple months.<p>However, the best the bears can probably get over the next few months is a test of the August and October lows at around 2800. They would then need at least a few sideways months before they would have a reasonable chance of a bigger reversal down. Therefore, traders should expect more sideways to up trading for at least a couple months.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>November buy climax at top of yearlong bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-closing-above-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-16-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart closing above top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart is particularly interesting. This week was the 6th consecutive bull trend bar. That is unusual, especially late in a bull trend. Traders should expect a 1 – 2 week pullback to begin by the end of November.<p>However, there have been 6 bull bars with each low above the low of the prior week. There is a 7 bar bull micro channel, which means that the bulls have been eager. They therefore would like an opportunity to finally buy below the low of the prior week. Consequently, the next pullback will probably only last 1 – 2 weeks. After that, at a minimum, traders should expect a test of the high.<h3>Near the top of the yearlong bull channel</h3><p>Where will this rally end? The Emini on Friday closed slightly above the top of the yearlong bull channel. Tests of resistance are rarely perfect. The momentum up is strong enough for traders to expect at least a slightly bigger break above the top of the bull channel.<p>But, channels reliably contain trends. The bulls look to take profits and the bears start to sell around the top of the bull channel. At the bottom of the channel (the bull trend line), the bears will take profits and the bulls will buy again. Traders should therefore expect a 1 – 2 week pullback to start within a couple weeks.<h3>Bull breakout above the bull channel is unlikely</h3><p>The Emini obviously can break far above the bull channel and begin an even stronger bull trend. But that happens only 25% of the time. Most the time, traders should think of a bull channel as a bear flag.<p>There is a 75% chance of an eventual break below the bottom of the channel on the weekly chart. That is currently around 2930. Once that happens, the bull trend usually evolves into a trading range.<p>How does the reversal down occur? Usually there is a break above the top of the bull channel. Then, within about 5 bars (weeks), the breakout fails. Traders look for a reversal down to the bottom of the channel (the bull trend line).<p>The bulls will want another leg up from the bull trend line. However, the bears will want a break below the bull trend line and the end of the bull trend. That means either the start of a trading range or a bear trend. A test of the bottom of the channel is probably more than a month away.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Breakout above 6 day tight trading range</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-in-small-pullback-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-16-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart in small pullback bull trend\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart did something unusual this week. Through Thursday, there were 5 consecutive bull trend bars in a tight trading range. When the bulls are so bullish, the bars typically go up and not sideways.<p>On Friday, the Emini finally broke above the tight trading range. Six consecutive bull bars is fairly unusual, but there is no sign of a top. Traders therefore belief that the rally will continue at least a little longer. For example, the top of the yearlong bull channel on the weekly chart is now around 3125. The top of the 2 month bull channel on the daily chart is just below 3150. A measured move up from the August/October bottom is around 3200, which is just above the top of the bull channel on the monthly chart.<h3>Is a 5 – 8% pullback due?</h3><p>There were 3 small reversal attempts over the past 10 days. Each failed and formed a High 1 bull flag. Instead of a wedge top, the rally since the October low has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. That can last a long time.<p>However, look at the rallies in February, April, July, and September. Each was in a tight bull channel that lasted a month or so. Each was then followed by a 5 – 8% correction. The tops of the rallies created the top of the bull channel on the weekly chart.<p>The current rally looks similar to the earlier rallies and the Emini is once again near the top of the weekly bull channel. Will there be a 5 – 8% correction this time? Eventually, yes, but the weekly chart has had 6 consecutive bull trend bars. Therefore, traders will probably buy the 1st 1 – 2 week selloff.<p>The bears will likely need at least a small double top before then can get a 5 – 8% selloff to the bottom of the bull channel. Traders should expect higher prices, even if there is a 2 week selloff first.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

That is extreme and therefore climactic. Furthermore, there have been 3 pushes up in a tight bull channel on the daily chart. A reversal down this week will be from a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>Friday closed slightly above the top of the yearlong bull channel on the weekly chart. There is no reversal down yet and therefore the Emini will probably trade at least a little higher this week. However, Friday was a big day and it therefore was climactic. The bears will try to create a bear bar early this week, hoping for the start of a 1 – 2 week pullback.<p>The rallies on the daily and weekly charts are strong. Consequently, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top on the weekly chart before they can test the bottom of the channel at around 2930. Therefore, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 2 week pullback. However, the rally has been in a buy climax and it has reached reliable resistance. Traders should expect a 1 – 2 week pullback to begin by the end of the month.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 1 point in the Globex session. Because there is a potential parabolic wedge on the daily chart, the bears want a credible sell signal bar early this week. They need a day closing on or near its low. That can come from either a bear trend day or from an early rally that reverses down. Day traders therefore should be looking for a possible swing down today.<p>While the Emini reached the top of the bull channel on the weekly chart, there are bull channels on the daily and monthly charts as well. Their tops are above last week’s high. Traders know that there could be a blow-off top over the next couple weeks. That means there is an increased chance of several more consecutive bull trend days.<p>With the Emini in a buy climax at major resistance, there is an increase chance of one or more big bull or bear trend days.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-weak-bull-trend-to-all-time-high.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-18.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and weak bull trend to all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday.

There is a double bottom with the October 15 low. However, the 2 week bear channel was tight. That usually means that the 1st reversal up will be minor. The bulls may need a small double bottom before they can get a rally back up to the October high.<p>The bears hope that the 3 day rally will be a bear flag. They want a breakout below that October low. That would indicate that the 2 year bear channel is still in effect. There are measured move targets and a gap around 1.08, and therefore there is a magnet below.<p>What is most likely? Confusion. The EURUSD is in the middle of a 4 month trading range. Traders expect legs up will disappoint the bulls and legs down will disappoint the bears. They know that reversals are more common than successful breakouts. There will probably be buyers below the October 1 low of the range and sellers above the October 21 top of the range. Since last week’s bottom will probably be minor, traders expect a sideways week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small range overnight. There has been no follow-through buying after Friday’s bull trend day.<p>This is typical when the daily chart is in a trading range. If the bulls get a big bull bar on the daily chart, traders will conclude that the rally will continue up to the October 31 high. More likely, today a small, trading range day.<p>If today sells off and closes on its low, today will be a sell signal bar on the daily chart. The bears will try to get a break below last week’s low and then below the October low.<p>When there is a weak buy setup in the middle of a trading range, the chart usually has to go sideways for a few days. Many traders wait for a 2nd signal on the daily chart, like a small double bottom or double top.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-weak-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was the 7th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart and there is room to the top of the daily and monthly bull channels.<p>The 7 week rally is in a tight bull channel. Furthermore, there have been 3 legs up. This is a parabolic wedge buy climax, which typically attracts some profit-taking. Consequently, traders should expect a 1 – 2 week pullback to begin by the end of the month.<p>However, the bull trend on the weekly chart is strong.

That is extreme and therefore climactic. Furthermore, there have been 3 pushes up in a tight bull channel on the daily chart. A reversal down this week will be from a parabolic wedge buy climax.<p>Friday closed slightly above the top of the yearlong bull channel on the weekly chart. There is no reversal down yet and therefore the Emini will probably trade at least a little higher this week. However, Friday was a big day and it therefore was climactic. The bears will try to create a bear bar early this week, hoping for the start of a 1 – 2 week pullback.<p>The rallies on the daily and weekly charts are strong. Consequently, the bears will probably need at least a micro double top on the weekly chart before they can test the bottom of the channel at around 2930. Therefore, traders will buy the 1st 1 – 2 week pullback. However, the rally has been in a buy climax and it has reached reliable resistance. Traders should expect a 1 – 2 week pullback to begin by the end of the month.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 1 point in the Globex session. Because there is a potential parabolic wedge on the daily chart, the bears want a credible sell signal bar early this week. They need a day closing on or near its low. That can come from either a bear trend day or from an early rally that reverses down. Day traders therefore should be looking for a possible swing down today.<p>While the Emini reached the top of the bull channel on the weekly chart, there are bull channels on the daily and monthly charts as well. Their tops are above last week’s high. Traders know that there could be a blow-off top over the next couple weeks. That means there is an increased chance of several more consecutive bull trend days.<p>With the Emini in a buy climax at major resistance, there is an increase chance of one or more big bull or bear trend days.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-high-2-bottom-and-weak-bull-trend-to-all-time-high.png\"><img src=\"2019-11-18.png\" alt=\"Emini high 2 bottom and weak bull trend to all time high\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-bottom-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-18-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex head and shoulders bottom\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market had a buy signal bar on Friday. There is a double bottom with the October 15 low. However, the 2 week bear channel was tight. That usually means that the 1st reversal up will be minor. The bulls may need a small double bottom before they can get a rally back up to the October high.<p>The bears hope that the 3 day rally will be a bear flag. They want a breakout below that October low. That would indicate that the 2 year bear channel is still in effect. There are measured move targets and a gap around 1.08, and therefore there is a magnet below.<p>What is most likely? Confusion. The EURUSD is in the middle of a 4 month trading range. Traders expect legs up will disappoint the bulls and legs down will disappoint the bears. They know that reversals are more common than successful breakouts. There will probably be buyers below the October 1 low of the range and sellers above the October 21 top of the range. Since last week’s bottom will probably be minor, traders expect a sideways week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a small range overnight. There has been no follow-through buying after Friday’s bull trend day.<p>This is typical when the daily chart is in a trading range. If the bulls get a big bull bar on the daily chart, traders will conclude that the rally will continue up to the October 31 high. More likely, today a small, trading range day.<p>If today sells off and closes on its low, today will be a sell signal bar on the daily chart. The bears will try to get a break below last week’s low and then below the October low.<p>When there is a weak buy setup in the middle of a trading range, the chart usually has to go sideways for a few days. Many traders wait for a 2nd signal on the daily chart, like a small double bottom or double top.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-weak-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-18-2.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Today was the 7th consecutive bull bar on the daily chart and there is room to the top of the daily and monthly bull channels.<p>The 7 week rally is in a tight bull channel. Furthermore, there have been 3 legs up. This is a parabolic wedge buy climax, which typically attracts some profit-taking. Consequently, traders should expect a 1 – 2 week pullback to begin by the end of the month.<p>However, the bull trend on the weekly chart is strong. Therefore, traders will buy the pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Furthermore, it was the 7th consecutive bull trend bar on the daily chart. That is unusual and therefore climactic. Also, the past 2 weeks formed a 3rd leg up in a tight bull channel on the daily chart. As a result, the chart has a parabolic wedge buy climax, which usually will attract some profit takers.<p>In addition, last week was a bigger bull bar on the weekly chart. When there is a bigger bull bar after about 5 bars in a Buy The Close rally, it typically begins to attract profit-takers. Many bulls begin to prefer to buy pullbacks instead of buying at the market and on strong bull closes (“Buy The Close” type of bull trend).<p>This increases the chance of a bear bar this week on the weekly chart. A 7th consecutive bull bar on the weekly chart would be very unusual. However, the bulls will buy the 1st 1 – 2 week, 50 – 100 point pullback.<p>While most recent days have had a lot of trading range price action, there is an increasing chance of one or more strong bear trend days soon. Until then, the bulls keep buying every pullback on the 5 minute chart. They might continue to do so until the Emini reaches the top of the channels on the daily and monthly charts at around 3150 – 3175.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 8 points in the Globex session. It therefore might gap up on the open. Since the rally is very strong on the daily charts, the Emini might get vacuumed up to the monthly bull trend line at around 3175 within the next couple weeks.<p>Most recent days have had a lot of trading range price action, yet all have closed above the open. Even though this is an extreme buy climax, day traders are continuing to focus on buying. They will continue to do this until there is a strong reversal down.<p>This is like a game of musical chairs. Once the music stops, there will be a panic to grab a chair (exit longs). Right now, the music is still playing. But, it could stop any day this week. That would result in a bear trend day.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-weak-bull-trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-19.png\" alt=\"Emini weak bull trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

That means that the bulls and bears are balanced. Furthermore, a trading range always has both a reasonable buy and sell setup. The bulls want the higher low major trend reversal to lead to a 2nd leg up from the October 1 wedge bottom.<p>However, the weekly chart has been in a bear channel for 2 years. The bears have sold every 2 – 4 week rally. They see this 3 day rally as forming a double top bear flag with the micro double top of November 6 and 7. They want a break below the October low and another new low in the 2 year bear channel.<p>Trading ranges constantly disappoint bulls and bears. Every move up or down is more likely to reverse than to begin a trend. Consequently, this 3 day rally might test down to the November 14 low before reaching the October high.<p>Even though the weekly chart is in a clear bear trend, the daily chart is in a trading range. Traders continue to sell rallies, buy selloffs, and take profits every week or two.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 20 pip range overnight. Traders are deciding whether the 3 day rally will continue up to the October 31 high or reverse down to the November 14 low.<p>Yesterday’s high and the November 6 and 7 highs are important resistance. Unless the bulls get a breakout above those highs today or tomorrow, they will exit. Traders would then expect a test of the November 14 low.<p>The lack of momentum overnight is a sign that traders will probably need another day to decide. Consequently, day traders will continue their overnight scalping today unless there is a surprisingly strong breakout up or down today.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-19-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

But there were buyers above yesterday’s low and they prevented today from becoming an outside down day.<p>However, they could not prevent today from being the 1st bear bar on the daily chart in 8 days. That increases the chance of a pullback tomorrow. But after 7 consecutive bull days, the 1st reversal down will probably only last a day or two.<p>Buy climaxes do not last forever. Traders should still expect the start of a 2 week pullback by the end of the month.

However, a strong bull trend does not typically immediately reverse into a bear trend. Most traders want to see at least a small double top.<p>The bulls have been so eager to buy that they have been buying above the prior day’s low for 4 days. Many will be happy to finally get an opportunity to buy below a prior day’s low. As a result, there will probably be buyers not far below yesterday’s low.<p>There are also 6 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart. In addition, last week’s range increased and therefore will probably attract some profit takers. Therefore, this week will probably close below its open or at least near its open. A doji bar is common after a buy climax bar.<p>The open will likely be a magnet all week. Since a big bear bar is unlikely, the bear body will probably be small. That means the week will probably close only a little below the week’s open. This will probably lead to mostly sideways trading around the open of the week for the remainder of the week.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is down 8 points in the Globex session. It might gap below yesterday’s low. If so, the gap will be small. Small gaps usually close in the 1st hour. Since the daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend, traders expect the pullback to last for 1 – 3 days.<p>However, the weekly chart will probably form a doji bar this week after last week’s bigger bar. Consequently, the Emini might stay around the open of the week for the remainder of the week. That increases the chance of trading range price action for the rest of the week.<p>Because the bull trend on the daily chart is strong, traders always have to be ready for a surprisingly big bull day. But the daily and weekly charts are in buy climaxes at the top of the weekly bull channel. Consequently, there is a slightly increased chance of a big bear day soon. But the bears will probably need a micro double top first. Most likely, the Emini will be sideways for a few days.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bear-trend-from-the-open-and-then-trading-range.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-20.png\" alt=\"Emini bear trend from the open and then trading range\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-bear-flag.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-20-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top bear flag\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market is reversing up from a higher low major trend reversal. Since the 2 week selloff was in a tight bear channel, the 4 day rally will probably be minor. That means that traders expect a test down for a few days before there is a test of the October high.<p>The appearance of this week is important on the weekly chart. Last week was a good buy signal bar for a High 2 bull flag and head and shoulders bottom. This week is the entry bar. If the bulls can create a big bull bar this week, it will erase the bearishness of the bar from 2 weeks ago.<p>But so far, this week has a small range. That hesitation reduces the chance of the rally continuing up next week. It makes several sideways days more likely.<p>Furthermore, 2 weeks ago was a Bear Surprise Bar on the weekly chart. That typically has at least a small 2nd leg sideways to down. The inability of the bulls to rally strongly this week makes some sideways to down trading likely next week.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight in a weak bear channel. Traders are deciding if the weekly chart will get a 2nd leg down after the big week down 2 weeks ago. The other possibility is that the the bulls will get a 2nd leg up on the daily chart after 4 consecutive bull bars on the daily chart.<p>The EURUSD is also in the middle of the month-long trading range, which is in a 4 month trading range. Traders expect disappointing follow-through up and down. That means reversals. It also means lots of trading range price action on the 5 minute chart.<p>After 4 bull days on the daily chart, there will probably be buyers below yesterday’s low. That should limit the downside today. However, the bulls have been unable to create a good entry bar on the weekly chart after 3 days. That means the upside also is probably be small. What’s left? Mostly trading range trading. Day traders will look for reversals to scalp for 10 pips.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bear-major-surprise-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-20-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bear major surprise breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It fell below the 3100 Big Round Number and the 6 week bull trend line. But it reversed back above the midpoint and today was a doji bar on the daily chart.<p>This is a credible start for the 1 – 2 week, 50 – 100 point pullback that I said was likely to begin in November. However, the big reversal back up increases the uncertainty. That therefore increases the chance of sideways price action for a day or two.<p>Even if there is a 2 week selloff that falls 100 points, after 6 bull bars on the weekly chart, traders will probably buy the pullback.<p>Since today was a major Bear Surprise Breakout on the 5 minute chart, there will probably some follow-through selling over the next few days. This is true even if the Emini gets back to the open of the week first.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It triggered the parabolic wedge top sell signal on the daily chart by falling below Tuesday’s low. It also broke below the bull trend line at the bottom of the 6 week tight bull channel. Finally, it dipped back below the 3100 Big Round Number, which was resistance for several days last week.<p>However, it closed the day above the support and above the middle of the day’s range. It was a bear doji bar on the daily chart and not a strong bear day. Yesterday is now a weak buy signal bar on the daily chart for a High 1 bull flag.<p>Because it is weak buy setup in an overbought market, there will probably be sellers not too far above its high and above Tuesday’s all-time high. Furthermore, the open of the week will probably be a magnet through tomorrow’s close. Traders will expect this to limit both the upside and downside for today and tomorrow.<h3>Has a 1 – 2 week pullback begun?</h3><p>Yesterday is a good candidate for the start of the 1 – 2 week pullback that I thought would begin in November. The pullback so far has been 40 points. I have been saying that it would probably be 50 – 100 points. Also, it is likely to last more than a couple days. Consequently, traders should expect sideways to down trading over the next week. This is true even if there is one more new high 1st.<p>Will this be the 8% correction that some on TV are predicting? Probably not. After 6 bull bars on the weekly chart, the bears will likely need at least a micro double top on that chart before they can get more than a week or two of selling.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. Yesterday’s strong selloff and then big reversal up created confusion. Confusion typically results in a trading range.<p>This is especially true with the Emini so close to several magnets. The open of the week is the most important. Traders expect a small bear body on the weekly chart this week after last week’s buy climax and 6 consecutive bull trend bars on the weekly chart. The other magnets are the 3100 Big Round Number, the EMA on the 60 minute chart, the bull trend line on the daily chart, and yesterday’s high.<p>Since trading range trading is likely today and tomorrow, day traders should expect at least one swing up and one swing down during both days. A strong trend is unlikely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bear-major-surprise-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-21.png\" alt=\"Emini bear major surprise breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to up. The 2 week rally meets the minimum objective.<p>The bulls want a test of the October high and a major trend reversal into a bull trend. However, the bears want a lower high and a resumption of the 2 year bear trend.<p>While the weekly chart is in a bear channel, the daily chart has been in a trading range for 4 months. Trading ranges resist breaking out into trends. Consequently, both the bulls and bears will probably be disappointed by the next several weeks. There will probably be sellers near the 1.12 top of the range and buyers near the 1.09 bottom.<p>Since the October rally on the weekly chart was the strongest one in 2 years, there will probably be a test of the October high. But there might be a test of the October low first. Traders should expect limited downside over the next few weeks and a test of the 13 month bear trend line and the October double top. Both are around 1.12.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high overnight. That triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart.<p>Today is the entry bar. So far, it is a small bull trend bar on the daily chart. While this is good for the bulls, a bigger bar would be much better. The rally over the past 6 hours has only been 30 pips. This is not a strong bull trend. Day traders are not buying as the EURUSD is going up. They therefore are waiting for pullbacks. That makes a big bull trend day unlikely.<p>While the rally has been small, so have the pullbacks. The bears are not yet selling. If the 5 minute chart begins to go sideways for 5 – 10 bars, the bears will look to sell reversals down for 10 pip scalps.<p>Today will probably be a small trading range day. The bulls will continue to look for 10 – 20 pip pullbacks to buy for scalps and the bears will begin to scalp once the 5 minute chart begins to go sideways.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was a trading range day.<p>Since the open of the week, I have said that this week would probably form a bear bar on the weekly chart. That is still likely. But the bulls are trying to form a 7th consecutive bull bar on the weekly chart. They hope to get the week to close above the week’s open.<p>While they might get back to the open of the week tomorrow, they will probably fail to create a 7th bull bar. The best they probably will get is a big tail on the bottom of this week’s candle stick. Tomorrow will probably again have mostly trading range price action. The Emini might have begun a 2 week, 50 – 100 point pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It triggered the parabolic wedge top sell signal on the daily chart by falling below Tuesday’s low. It also broke below the bull trend line at the bottom of the 6 week tight bull channel. Finally, it dipped back below the 3100 Big Round Number, which was resistance for several days last week.<p>However, it closed the day above the support and above the middle of the day’s range. It was a bear doji bar on the daily chart and not a strong bear day. Yesterday is now a weak buy signal bar on the daily chart for a High 1 bull flag.<p>Because it is weak buy setup in an overbought market, there will probably be sellers not too far above its high and above Tuesday’s all-time high. Furthermore, the open of the week will probably be a magnet through tomorrow’s close. Traders will expect this to limit both the upside and downside for today and tomorrow.<h3>Has a 1 – 2 week pullback begun?</h3><p>Yesterday is a good candidate for the start of the 1 – 2 week pullback that I thought would begin in November. The pullback so far has been 40 points. I have been saying that it would probably be 50 – 100 points. Also, it is likely to last more than a couple days. Consequently, traders should expect sideways to down trading over the next week. This is true even if there is one more new high 1st.<p>Will this be the 8% correction that some on TV are predicting? Probably not. After 6 bull bars on the weekly chart, the bears will likely need at least a micro double top on that chart before they can get more than a week or two of selling.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. Yesterday’s strong selloff and then big reversal up created confusion. Confusion typically results in a trading range.<p>This is especially true with the Emini so close to several magnets. The open of the week is the most important. Traders expect a small bear body on the weekly chart this week after last week’s buy climax and 6 consecutive bull trend bars on the weekly chart. The other magnets are the 3100 Big Round Number, the EMA on the 60 minute chart, the bull trend line on the daily chart, and yesterday’s high.<p>Since trading range trading is likely today and tomorrow, day traders should expect at least one swing up and one swing down during both days. A strong trend is unlikely.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bear-major-surprise-breakout.png\"><img src=\"2019-11-21.png\" alt=\"Emini bear major surprise breakout\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-head-and-shoulders-bottom-major-trend-reversal.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-21-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex head and shoulders bottom major trend reversal\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market formed a higher low last week after a wedge bottom. Traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to up. The 2 week rally meets the minimum objective.<p>The bulls want a test of the October high and a major trend reversal into a bull trend. However, the bears want a lower high and a resumption of the 2 year bear trend.<p>While the weekly chart is in a bear channel, the daily chart has been in a trading range for 4 months. Trading ranges resist breaking out into trends. Consequently, both the bulls and bears will probably be disappointed by the next several weeks. There will probably be sellers near the 1.12 top of the range and buyers near the 1.09 bottom.<p>Since the October rally on the weekly chart was the strongest one in 2 years, there will probably be a test of the October high. But there might be a test of the October low first. Traders should expect limited downside over the next few weeks and a test of the 13 month bear trend line and the October double top. Both are around 1.12.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market broke above yesterday’s high overnight. That triggered a High 1 bull flag buy signal on the daily chart.<p>Today is the entry bar. So far, it is a small bull trend bar on the daily chart. While this is good for the bulls, a bigger bar would be much better. The rally over the past 6 hours has only been 30 pips. This is not a strong bull trend. Day traders are not buying as the EURUSD is going up. They therefore are waiting for pullbacks. That makes a big bull trend day unlikely.<p>While the rally has been small, so have the pullbacks. The bears are not yet selling. If the 5 minute chart begins to go sideways for 5 – 10 bars, the bears will look to sell reversals down for 10 pip scalps.<p>Today will probably be a small trading range day. The bulls will continue to look for 10 – 20 pip pullbacks to buy for scalps and the bears will begin to scalp once the 5 minute chart begins to go sideways.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-21-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

It was a trading range day.<p>Since the open of the week, I have said that this week would probably form a bear bar on the weekly chart. That is still likely. But the bulls are trying to form a 7th consecutive bull bar on the weekly chart. They hope to get the week to close above the week’s open.<p>While they might get back to the open of the week tomorrow, they will probably fail to create a 7th bull bar. The best they probably will get is a big tail on the bottom of this week’s candle stick. Tomorrow will probably again have mostly trading range price action. The Emini might have begun a 2 week, 50 – 100 point pullback.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It is a High 1 bull flag buy signal bar for today. But the past 2 days had bear bodies. This is a weak buy setup. Traders will expect sellers not far above yesterday’s high.<p>The dominant force today will be the magnetic pull of the open of the week. The bulls want a 7th consecutive bull bar on the weekly chart. They will therefore try to get today to close above the open of the week.<p>But 7 consecutive bull bars late in a bull trend is very unusual. Consequently, the bulls will probably fail. That means that today will have a hard time holding above the open of the week. Therefore today will probably not be a strong bull trend day.<p>Can it be a strong bear trend day? The daily chart is still in a Small Pullback Bull Trend. While Wednesday broke below the bull trend line, it was not a strong bear day. The bears will probably need a micro double top before they can begin a 50 – 100 point correction. That makes a big bear day unlikely as well.<p>Most likely, the bulls will try to get above the open of the week, but the week will close below the open. Today will probably be a 3rd consecutive sideways trading range day.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 5 points in the Globex session. It is within 10 points of the open of the week. Today is Friday and that is the most important price on the weekly chart. The bulls want today to close above the open of the week. This week would then be the 7th consecutive bull bar on the weekly chart.<p>If there is a rally to above the 3116.00 open of the week today, traders should look for a late selloff to below that price. If the Emini is 5 points or so below the open of the week in the final hour, there might be a rally up to 3116.00. However, there will probably be more sellers than buyers there. Day traders should expect the week to close below its open.<p>The past 14 days have been mostly sideways and small. There has been at least one reversal every day. Since markets have inertia, day traders will assume that this price action will continue today unless they see a surprisingly strong breakout up or down with strong follow-through.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-trading-range-day.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-22.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range day\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Every trading range always has both reasonable buy and sell signals. But markets have inertia and resist change. Consequently, most signals within a trading range are minor. They lead to moves up and down that last 1 – 3 weeks and there is then an opposite signal.<p>The bears have a double top with the high of a bar from 2 weeks ago. Because the bear channel down to the November 14 low was tight, the EURUSD might have to test that low before the bulls can reach the October high and the 13 month bear trend line.<p>The October rally on the weekly chart (not shown) was the strongest rally in the entire 2 year bear trend. Traders therefore expect a 2nd leg up. It might have begun with the November 14 low.<p>More likely, the bulls want a 2nd reversal up from that level to confirm that the bulls are in control. Therefore, the EURUSD might have to test below 1.10 before the 2nd leg up to 1.12 begins.<p>The daily chart has been sideways in a tight range for 5 days. Day traders have been scalping for 10 – 20 pips while they wait for a breakout of the 5 day range.<h3>On weekly chart, weak sell signal after week buy signal</h3><p>Today is Friday and therefore the weekly chart is important. This week triggered a buy signal on the weekly chart.<p>However, the rally was small and now the EURUSD is back to the low and open of the week. This week will therefore probably close near the low of the week. It would then be a minor sell signal bar for next week.<p>The bears want as strong a sell signal bar as possible. They therefore will try to get the week to close far below the open. More likely, it will close around the open and become a weak sell signal bar for next week. There is no sign that a big move up or down is about to begin.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been in a 10 pip range for the past 5 hours. Day traders are scalping. But when the range is this small, it is difficult to make any money.<p>The EURUSD is back at the open of the week, which is a magnet, and it probably will stay within 20 pips of it all day. Consequently, day traders will continue to look for small scalps.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-double-top-and-then-wedge-bottom-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-22-2.png\" alt=\"Emini double top and then wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h3>End of day summary</h3><p>The Emini sold off on the open but it reversed up from below the bottom of the 18 bar range and 3100. Furthermore, the bottom was a wedge bottom with good buy signal bar. If you look back to yesterday, the low was the 3rd leg down in an expanding triangle bottom.<p>Despite the rally, the Emini could not close above the open of the week. This week was therefore the 1st bear bar on the weekly chart in 7 weeks. That increases the chance of another week of sideways to down trading next week.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Traders should expect 2 weeks of sideways to down trading.<p>The 30 year<strong>bond futures</strong>is in a buy climax on the monthly chart. It will probably enter a trading range for many months.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market is trying to get a 2nd leg up after its October rally. The bulls might need a double bottom with the November 14 low first.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market monthly chart:</strong><br>Minor reversal down from yearlong buy climax, trading range likely</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Bond-futures-ii-sell-signal-after-pararbolic-wedge-top-and-nested-wedges.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-23.png\" alt=\"Bond futures ii sell signal after pararbolic wedge top and nested wedges\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures market has pulled back for 3 months. On the monthly chart, November fell below the October low and triggered a buy climax sell signal.<p>However, with one week left to the month, the bond futures market rallied back above last month’s low. While November’s candlestick has a bear body, it is so far holding above the midpoint of the bar. November is now a buy signal bar for next month. But after 3 bear bars and a buy climax in August, this is a weak buy signal. There will probably be sellers above the November high.<h3>Buy climaxes attract profit-takers</h3><p>September and October were consecutive inside bars. They therefore formed an ii top sell setup. Traders expected at least a minor reversal down because August was a huge bull bar and it was the 3rd leg up in a parabolic wedge rally in 2019. A big bull bar late in a bull trend typically attracts profit-taking.<p>When there is a buy climax, the stop for the bulls is far below. Risk managers have to bring the risk back down to an acceptable level. The easiest way to do this is to reduce the size of their positions. This profit-taking typically results in at least a small pullback.<h3>How big will the reversal down be?</h3><p>In this particular case, the buy climax was unusually extreme. When that is the case, traders wonder if the pullback will be more extreme. The bulls become cautious. They are more likely to wait for more bars before buying again. They want to be confident that the profit-taking has ended.<p>Also, they want to be sure that the bears were unable to create a bear trend reversal. After an extreme buy climax, this process usually takes at least 5 – 10 bars. Therefore, the upside over the next several months is small.<p>In addition, the 2019 bull trend was exceptionally strong. A strong bull trend only rarely immediately reverses into a bear trend. There typically is a transition from a bull trend to a bear trend. This usually requires many bars. Consequently, the downside over the next few months is small as well.<p>If the monthly chart cannot go up or down much for several months, traders should expect it to be mostly sideways. The trading range could last all of 2020.<h3>Bonds are in the process of forming a major top</h3><p>I have written many times about the nested wedge top on the monthly chart. Bond futures will probably work lower over the next 20 years. This is true even if there is another brief new high first.<p>However, the top might take many years to complete. For example, the August high could end up as the head of a head and shoulders top. The left shoulder was more than 3 years ago, in July 2016. There is often symmetry with the head approximately in the middle. If that happens here, the right shoulder could come 3 years from now. Also, the bear breakout might follow a year or more after that.<p>While the monthly chart is creating a top that will last for 20 or more years, the current 3 year trading range could last for several more years before a bear trend becomes clear. That means that interest rates could remain low for a long time.<p>It is important to remember what I have said about the possibility of negative interest rates in the US. The American public will not allow the Treasury to issue bonds with negative interest rates. They will also not allow the Treasury to sell a bond to the public for $100,000, and then when it matures, give the buyer only $95,000. That is what most people mean when they talk about negative interest rates. It is simply un-American for the government to borrow money from its citizens and then charge those citizens a fee for lending the money.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>Weak reversal up so probably a little more sideways to down</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-Low-1-sell-signal-bar-and-head-and-shoulders-bottom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-23-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex Low 1 sell signal bar and head and shoulders bottom\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart formed a buy signal bar last week. It was a bull bar closing near its high, which is good. But the context was not so good.<p>The weekly chart has been in a bear trend for 22 months and in a tight bear channel for 14 months. Also, the week before was a surprisingly big bear bar closing on its low. Was the buy signal bar a strong enough foundation to support a rally that would reverse that selloff? It might have been, but the bulls needed a strong entry bar this past week. They did not get what they wanted.<p>Now traders are wondering if the 4 week selloff will continue down to the October low. This past week closed on its low. It is now a Low 1 sell signal bar for next week.<p>The October rally had 3 consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. This was the strongest rally on the weekly chart in the 2 year bear trend. Consequently, traders are looking for a 2nd leg up. The bulls tried over the past 2 weeks but failed.<p>I have been saying that the 2 week bear channel down to the November 14 low was tight. I wrote that the tight bear channel meant that the 2 week bounce was probably going to be minor. That means a bull leg in the 14 month bear channel.<p>Furthermore, I said that the bulls might need a micro double bottom test of the November 14 low before they could get that 2nd leg up on the weekly chart. That appears to be the case.<h3>What about a new low in the 22 month bear channel?</h3><p>Can the bears get a breakout below the October low? At the moment, it is more likely that the bulls will get a 2nd leg up to the October high and the 13 month bear trend line at around 1.12. But they may need a double bottom with the November 14 low on the daily chart. That would be a micro double bottom on the weekly chart.<p>Even if the bears break below the October low, traders will buy the breakout. It would be no different from any of the other new lows for almost 2 years. The bears buy back shorts at every new low and the bulls buy for a 2 – 3 week reversal up.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Small bull bar with room to top of bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-SP500-monthly-candlestick-chart-in-bull-breakout.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-23-2.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 monthly candlestick chart in bull breakout\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;has a bull bar so far in November. Also, the gap above the October high is still open.<p>Next week is the final week of the month. Since Thursday is a holiday and Friday will have light trading, there is not much time left. Traders expect the month to remain a small bull trend bar.<p>However, if there is a selloff next week, there will be a prominent tail on the top of this month’s candlestick. That will make November less bullish. The bears will have to wait at least one more month before they can hope to create a reliable sell signal bar.<p>And even when they finally get a sell signal bar, it will be in a tight bull channel. A reversal down will probably only last a month or two, like all of the other selloffs over the past 2 years.<h3>Top of bull channel is a magnet above</h3><p>Monthly trend lines are very important. Every major selloff since 1929 has reversed up at a bull trend line on the monthly chart.<p>The tops of bull channels are also important. Draw a line from the May 2007 high to the January 2018 high. The current rally is the 3rd leg up in that bull channel. That line is around 3170. It is therefore a magnet.<p>When a reversal comes from a line on the monthly chart, there is usually an overshoot. Therefore, the current rally might reach 3200 or 3250 before the bulls will take profits and the bears will sell. This is true even if there is a pullback for a month or two before the Emini reaches the line. However, there will probably be sellers up there.<p>How big of a reversal can the bears get? Well, the 2019 rally has been in a tight bull channel. A tight bull channel usually needs to go sideways for several bars before the bears can get a significant reversal. Therefore, the downside risk over then next couple months is small.<p>There is another problem for the bears. Traders like to see symmetry when they draw lines. The space between the 1st 2 points for this line is much bigger than between the 2nd and upcoming 3rd point. That is a less reliable line. It therefore is less likely to lead to a significant selloff. A pause for a few months is more likely than a bear trend.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>1st bear bar after 6 consecutive bull bars</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-SP500-weekly-candlestick-chart-has-bear-bar-at-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-23-3.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 weekly candlestick chart has bear bar at top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart finally had a bear body this week. This was likely since 6 consecutive bull trend bars is unusual late in a bull trend.<p>Also, last week’s range increased. When there is a Buy The Close bull trend and the 5th or 6th bar increases in size and closes near its high, it typically attracts some profit-taking. The stop for the bulls is far below and the bulls want to reduce their risk. The easiest way is to reduce their position size.<p>Since they suspect that there will be a pullback soon, they see a big bull bar as a gift. It is a great and probably brief opportunity to take unexpectedly big profits. And many do.<p>This typically results in a couple weeks of sideways to down trading. Traders therefore will look for a little more of a pullback over the next week or two.<p>A common target is the bottom of the most recent buy climax. That is the 3074.50 low of that big bull bar from last week. I have been saying that a 50 – 100 point pullback was likely. That low is 53.5 points below the high and it would meet my minimum objective.<h3>1st pullback will be brief</h3><p>When traders take profits, they do not immediately buy again. That is why I said that the pullback might last a couple weeks.<p>However, there has not been a pullback in 8 weeks. The bulls have been so eager to buy that they have been buying above the low of the prior week for a long time. Once they finally get an opportunity to buy below the low of the prior week, they will probably take it. That will limit the extent of the 1st reversal down.<p>But once the bull trend resumes, traders will pay attention to what happens on the test of the close of last week’s big bull bar. Will the bulls continue to buy and create another leg up? Or, will they be very disappointed by the pullback?<p>If so, the bulls who bought at the top of that bull bar will use the rally to exit their longs around breakeven. This would be a sign that they are afraid of another and bigger leg down.<p>If they do sell out of their longs, that selling would create a micro double top. The bears at that point would have a better chance of a deeper pullback. Their 1st target would be the July/September double top. That is the breakout point of the 2 month rally.<h3>Stalling at the top of the weekly bull channel</h3><p>I mentioned that there is a bull trend channel line around 3170 on the monthly chart. It is based on the 12 year bull channel. There are bull channels on the weekly and daily charts as well. On the daily chart, the channel began in mid-October. The top of that bull channel is around 3165.<p>I have mentioned the weekly channel several times recently. It began with the November 7, 2018 lower high. The current rally poked a little above the top of the channel during each of the past 2 weeks.<p>The weekly chart is therefore stalling at this resistance. But because the bull trend over the past 8 weeks has been in a micro channel, the bears will probably not be able to get a reversal down at this point. The best they probably can get is a small pullback, like a couple weeks of sideways to down trading. Traders typically like to see at least a micro double top before they will sell aggressively. The July 26 top is an example.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Finally broke below 6 week bull trend channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-SP500-daily-candlestick-chart-has-4-bear-bars-and-breakout-below-bull-channel-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-23-4.png\" alt=\"Emini S&amp;P500 daily candlestick chart has 4 bear bars and breakout below bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for 7 weeks. Every pullback lasted only a day or two before the bulls regained control.<p>But there is something different this time. The bears finally broke below the bottom of the bull channel. That increases the chance of a couple legs sideways to down over the next week or two. This is true even if there is a brief new high 1st.<p>The daily and weekly charts are in buy climaxes. That typically attracts profit-takers. This rally is about as long as the several other rallies in 2019. Each was followed by profit-taking and a 5 – 8% correction.<p>Traders therefore expect at least a small correction this time as well. But it might only be about 2%. That is because the 6 consecutive bull bars on the weekly chart mean that the weekly bulls are very eager. They will therefore probably buy the 1st 1 – 2 week pullback on the weekly chart.<p>It also means that the selloff on the daily chart will probably not last very long. Additionally, it increases the chance of it not being as big as the other selloffs in 2019. That is why I have been saying that it might only be 50 – 100 points instead of 200 – 300 points.<p>However, after the pullback and then a new high, the bears will have a better chance of a 5 – 10% correction. This is especially true if the Emini reaches the top of the monthly channel just below 3200.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

But Thursday was a bear bar and the 3rd consecutive bear bar. This was a low probability buy setup and there probably will be more sellers than buyers above Thursday’s high and above the all-time high.<p>Furthermore, the Emini broke below the 7 week bull channel last week. Traders should expect at least a small 2nd leg down.<p>Finally, last week was the 1st bear bar in 7 weeks on the weekly chart. While last week is not a strong sell signal bar, it probably will lead to at least one more week of sideways to down trading. If there is a new high, it will probably be brief and lead to a 2 week pullback shortly thereafter.<p>Most of the days for several weeks have had at least one reversal. Day traders will expect that again today. Because of the buy climaxes on the daily and weekly charts, there is a slightly increased chance of a strong bear trend day this week. However, since it is a holiday week, there is a greater chance of lots of tight trading range price action.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 7 points in the Globex session. It will therefore probably gap above Friday’s high. Traders are deciding if there will be a 2nd leg down after the bears broke below the bull trend line last week. Since the 7 week rally has been so strong, there is a 50% chance of a 1 – 2 week new high before a 100 point pullback.<p>Today is the 1st day of a holiday week. Also, the past 6 days had small ranges and were trading range days. Day traders expect another trading range day today.<p>But whenever something is especially likely, there is always an increased chance of the opposite. Consequently, if a Small Pullback Trend up or down begins to form, day traders will swing trade.<h2>Friday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-double-top-and-then-wedge-bottom-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-25.png\" alt=\"Emini double top and then wedge bottom\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from Friday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-double-top-bear-flag-and-head-and-shoulders-bottom-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-25-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex double top bear flag and head and shoulders bottom\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market is in the middle of a 4 month trading range. Trading ranges always have both buy and sell setups. The bulls hope that last week selloff will form a double bottom with the November 14 low. A reversal from there would create a head and shoulders bottom where the right shoulder is a double bottom.<p>Additionally, there would be a double bottom higher low major trend reversal. The 1st higher low in a bull trend often forms a small double bottom. But the bulls need a reversal up this week if they are going to create the double bottom.<p>Alternatively, the bulls will try to create a double bottom with the October 1 low. If the EURUSD falls below that low, the bulls would then try for a reversal up from a lower low. That would be an expanding triangle bottom with the September 3 and October 1 lows.<p>As you can see, there are many ways for a reversal up. But the bulls need to create a strong buy signal bar. Even if they get their reversal, it will be within a trading range. The rally would more likely just be a 2 – 4 week leg in the trading range than an actual reversal into a bear trend.<p>The bears know that every new low for 2 years reversed up within a week. However, as long as they keep making new lows, the 2 year bear trend is intact. That will encourage them to sell every 2 – 3 week rally, expecting another new low.<p>What is most likely over the next month? A continuation of the 4 month trading range, even if there is a brief breakout below the October low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to below last week’s low. It therefore triggered a minor sell signal on the weekly chart.<p>However, the overnight range is only 25 pips so far. That is not a strong bear breakout. Furthermore, the range has only been 10 pips for 5 hours. Scalpers cannot even make a 10 pip scalp.<p>While it is always possible that there will be a trend, the lack of energy makes a trading range day more likely. Also, the selloff is stalling just above the support of the November 14 low. That further makes a big move today unlikely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-trend-resumption-up-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and trend resumption up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That is what typically happens. The bulls got some trend resumption up at the end of the day.<p>There is no top yet on the daily and weekly charts. But both are in buy climaxes and last week had a bear bar on the weekly chart.<p>When there is a bear bar late in a buy climax and then a new high, there is usually a pullback within a couple weeks. However, the best the bears will probably get is a 50 – 100 point pullback for their first time down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

Trading ranges always have both buy and sell setups. The bulls hope that last week selloff will form a double bottom with the November 14 low. A reversal from there would create a head and shoulders bottom where the right shoulder is a double bottom.<p>Additionally, there would be a double bottom higher low major trend reversal. The 1st higher low in a bull trend often forms a small double bottom. But the bulls need a reversal up this week if they are going to create the double bottom.<p>Alternatively, the bulls will try to create a double bottom with the October 1 low. If the EURUSD falls below that low, the bulls would then try for a reversal up from a lower low. That would be an expanding triangle bottom with the September 3 and October 1 lows.<p>As you can see, there are many ways for a reversal up. But the bulls need to create a strong buy signal bar. Even if they get their reversal, it will be within a trading range. The rally would more likely just be a 2 – 4 week leg in the trading range than an actual reversal into a bear trend.<p>The bears know that every new low for 2 years reversed up within a week. However, as long as they keep making new lows, the 2 year bear trend is intact. That will encourage them to sell every 2 – 3 week rally, expecting another new low.<p>What is most likely over the next month? A continuation of the 4 month trading range, even if there is a brief breakout below the October low.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market sold off overnight to below last week’s low. It therefore triggered a minor sell signal on the weekly chart.<p>However, the overnight range is only 25 pips so far. That is not a strong bear breakout. Furthermore, the range has only been 10 pips for 5 hours. Scalpers cannot even make a 10 pip scalp.<p>While it is always possible that there will be a trend, the lack of energy makes a trading range day more likely. Also, the selloff is stalling just above the support of the November 14 low. That further makes a big move today unlikely.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-trend-resumption-up-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-25-2.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and trend resumption up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

That is what typically happens. The bulls got some trend resumption up at the end of the day.<p>There is no top yet on the daily and weekly charts. But both are in buy climaxes and last week had a bear bar on the weekly chart.<p>When there is a bear bar late in a buy climax and then a new high, there is usually a pullback within a couple weeks. However, the best the bears will probably get is a 50 – 100 point pullback for their first time down.<p><em>See the<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/tag/market-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">weekly update</a>for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.

It broke above last week’s high and to a new all-time high.<p>But last week had a bear body on the weekly chart and there is a buy climax on the weekly chart. This rally will probably only last a week or two before the Emini pulls back 50 – 100 points.<p>However, the bull trend is strong. Until there is a clear top or a big reversal down, the odds continue to favor higher prices. Since this is a holiday week, the Emini will probably spend a lot of time in trading ranges.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>After a big rally early in the Globex session, the Emini reversed down and is unchanged. With last week being a bear doji bar on the weekly chart in a buy climax, its close will probably be a magnet this week. Also, the holiday week will likely result in a lot of trading range price action. This is true even if there is a strong trend for an hour or two like yesterday.<p>This has been a great year for the bulls. Many will be quick to take some profits before the end of the year. Also, the buy climaxes on the daily and weekly charts increase the chance of profit taking soon. Consequently, there is an increased chance of a couple big bear days within the next few weeks.<p>But the tops of the monthly and daily bull channels are not far above. The 8 week rally could end with a blow-off top. That increases the chance of a surprisingly big bull day as well.<p>However, despite the strong bull trend on the daily chart, most days have spent most of their time within trading ranges. Day traders will trade the breakouts up or down with they come, but they expect them to evolve into trading range within an hour or so.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-bull-trend-from-the-open-and-trend-resumption-up-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-26.png\" alt=\"Emini bull trend from the open and trend resumption up\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

There is now both a double top and a double bottom. The chart is therefore in Breakout Mode. That means that there is a 50% chance of a bull breakout and a 50% chance of a bear breakout of the 3 week long pattern. Furthermore, there is a 50% chance that the 1st breakout will fail.<p>Finally, since the chart has been in a trading range for 4 months, traders will start to buy near the bottom at around 1.09. In addition, they will sell near the top at around 1.12.<p>Even if there is a breakout of the 4 month range, it will probably not get very far. Every rally and selloff for 2 years has reversed within a few weeks. There is no sign that this price action is about to change.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market so far has a small range. In addition, it is within yesterday’s range and today therefore is a small inside day.<p>Yesterday is a buy signal bar for a double bottom with the November 14 low. But it was the 4th consecutive bear bar. That is a weak buy setup. Additionally, the November 14 low is a magnet and it is just a little below yesterday’s low. These factors limit the upside today.<p>However, a magnet is support. Also, the range over the past 2 days has been small. Traders therefore do not expect a big bear day either. Today will probably be another day for scalpers.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-trading-range-with-late-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-26-2.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with late rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The selloff was a test of the open and the bulls bought it. That trend resumption up increase the chance of higher prices through the end of the month on Friday.<p>The daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend and therefore the odds are against a big move down. However, there will probably be a 100 point pullback beginning soon. The bulls might have to test the top of the monthly channel first, which is just below 3170.<p>It is important to consider the possibility that 2019 ends in the opposite way of 2018. Last year finished with a huge sell climax and then a big reversal up. Traders have to consider the possibility of this year ending with a blow-off top and then a surprisingly big reversal down.<p>Will today be a big bear day? Unlikely. Most days over the past several weeks have had at least one reversal and lots of trading range trading. Until that clearly ends, day traders will continue to take profits after 2 – 4 hours and look for reversals. Because tomorrow is a holiday, today could spend a lot of time in tight trading ranges.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. There might therefore be a small gap up today. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>Because the 60 minute chart’s rally over the past 3 days is extreme, there is an increased chance of a pause or a reversal down today. However, the bull trend on the daily and weekly charts is strong. Traders have been buying every 1 – 3 day pullback for 2 months. Consequently, there is not much downside risk over the next few days.<p>While the rally has been strong, most days have had at least one reversal. Day traders will expect that again today. Additionally, since tomorrow is a holiday, there is an increased chance of today spending a lot of time within a tight trading range. Finally, even if there is a tight range, day traders should be ready for a possible strong but brief breakout up or down in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-trading-range-with-late-rally.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-27.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with late rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday.

Over the past month, there was a double top and the bulls are now trying to create a double bottom. Additionally, they want today to form a micro double bottom with Monday’s low. A reversal up from here would create a higher low major trend reversal buy setup. Also, there would be a head and shoulders bottom.<p>Since there was a big nested wedge bottom reversal up in October, traders expect a 2nd leg up after the October rally. What they do not know the level where it will begin. The bulls want a good buy signal bar within a week. If they get it, traders will assume that the higher low bottom is probably about to reverse up.<p>If they are unable to get a reversal up within a week, that would indicate that there are not enough bulls at this price. The EURUSD would then probably have to fall to the next support level to find buyers. That is the October low.<p>Even if it were to fall below that low, traders would expect a reversal up. This is because the weekly chart has been in a bear channel for 2 years. Every new low reversed up within a couple weeks. There is no sign that this pattern is about to change.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market trade below yesterday’s low last night, but bounced. Yesterday was a bull day on the daily chart and therefore a weak Low 1 sell signal bar. There were therefore more likely to be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>The overnight range has only been 21 pips. Furthermore, the range over the past 5 hours has only been 10 pips. That makes it difficult even for scalpers to trade profitably. Day traders will look for reversals to scalp. But with 3 small days and tomorrow being a US holiday, there might not be many profitable day trades today.<p>The odds of a trend today are less than usual. However, if there is a strong breakout up or down, day traders should be ready to swing trade it.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-5-minute-chart-TR-Open-Then-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini 5 minute chart TR Open Then Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

The selloff was a test of the open and the bulls bought it. That trend resumption up increase the chance of higher prices through the end of the month on Friday.<p>The daily chart is in a Small Pullback Bull Trend and therefore the odds are against a big move down. However, there will probably be a 100 point pullback beginning soon. The bulls might have to test the top of the monthly channel first, which is just below 3170.<p>It is important to consider the possibility that 2019 ends in the opposite way of 2018. Last year finished with a huge sell climax and then a big reversal up. Traders have to consider the possibility of this year ending with a blow-off top and then a surprisingly big reversal down.<p>Will today be a big bear day? Unlikely. Most days over the past several weeks have had at least one reversal and lots of trading range trading. Until that clearly ends, day traders will continue to take profits after 2 – 4 hours and look for reversals. Because tomorrow is a holiday, today could spend a lot of time in tight trading ranges.<h3>Overnight Emini Globex trading</h3><p>The Emini is up 4 points in the Globex session. There might therefore be a small gap up today. Small gaps typically close in the 1st hour.<p>Because the 60 minute chart’s rally over the past 3 days is extreme, there is an increased chance of a pause or a reversal down today. However, the bull trend on the daily and weekly charts is strong. Traders have been buying every 1 – 3 day pullback for 2 months. Consequently, there is not much downside risk over the next few days.<p>While the rally has been strong, most days have had at least one reversal. Day traders will expect that again today. Additionally, since tomorrow is a holiday, there is an increased chance of today spending a lot of time within a tight trading range. Finally, even if there is a tight range, day traders should be ready for a possible strong but brief breakout up or down in the final hour.<h2>Yesterday’s setups</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-trading-range-with-late-rally.png\"><img src=\"2019-11-27.png\" alt=\"Emini trading range with late rally\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.<p class=\"caption\">My goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.<h2>EURUSD Forex market trading strategies</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-micro-double-bottom-after-double-top-in-breakout-mode.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-27-1.png\" alt=\"\"></a></figure><p>The daily chart of the EURUSD Forex market has been sideways in a tight range for 3 days. Over the past month, there was a double top and the bulls are now trying to create a double bottom. Additionally, they want today to form a micro double bottom with Monday’s low. A reversal up from here would create a higher low major trend reversal buy setup. Also, there would be a head and shoulders bottom.<p>Since there was a big nested wedge bottom reversal up in October, traders expect a 2nd leg up after the October rally. What they do not know the level where it will begin. The bulls want a good buy signal bar within a week. If they get it, traders will assume that the higher low bottom is probably about to reverse up.<p>If they are unable to get a reversal up within a week, that would indicate that there are not enough bulls at this price. The EURUSD would then probably have to fall to the next support level to find buyers. That is the October low.<p>Even if it were to fall below that low, traders would expect a reversal up. This is because the weekly chart has been in a bear channel for 2 years. Every new low reversed up within a couple weeks. There is no sign that this pattern is about to change.<h3>Overnight EURUSD Forex trading</h3><p>The 5 minute chart of the EURUSD Forex market trade below yesterday’s low last night, but bounced. Yesterday was a bull day on the daily chart and therefore a weak Low 1 sell signal bar. There were therefore more likely to be more buyers than sellers below its low.<p>The overnight range has only been 21 pips. Furthermore, the range over the past 5 hours has only been 10 pips. That makes it difficult even for scalpers to trade profitably. Day traders will look for reversals to scalp. But with 3 small days and tomorrow being a US holiday, there might not be many profitable day trades today.<p>The odds of a trend today are less than usual. However, if there is a strong breakout up or down, day traders should be ready to swing trade it.<h2>Summary of today’s S&amp;P Emini futures price action and what to expect tomorrow</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-5-minute-chart-TR-Open-Then-Small-Pullback-Bull-Trend.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-27-2.png\" alt=\"Emini 5 minute chart TR Open Then Small Pullback Bull Trend\"></a></figure><p class=\"caption\">Here are several reasonable stop entry setups for today.

Since the daily and weekly charts are overbought, there will probably be a brief pullback within a couple weeks.<p>The monthly<strong>bond</strong>chart is forming a major top, but there will probably be a trading range over the next year.<p>The<strong>EURUSD</strong>Forex market will probably rally for a few weeks soon. But it might have to test the October low 1st.<h2><strong>30 year Treasury bond Futures market:</strong><br>Weak entry bar after ii top on monthly chart</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Bond-futures-have-weak-entry-bar-after-parabolic-wedge-top.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-30.png\" alt=\"Bond futures have weak entry bar after parabolic wedge top\"></a></figure><p>The 30 year Treasury bond futures formed an ii sell signal on the monthly chart in October. An inside bar is a bar with a low at or above the low of the prior bar and a high at or below the high of that bar. An ii (inside-inside) pattern is present when there are consecutive inside bars, like October and September.<p>When November traded below the October low, it triggered the monthly ii sell signal. But both bars in the ii had prominent tails. That means traders bought near the lows of those months.<p>That also means that the ii is a weaker topping pattern. November is consistent with this. It sold off early in the month to a couple points below the October low. But it then reversed up to above the October low.<p>That is not what the bears want. They want lower prices. The chance of them getting lower prices would have been higher if November closed on its low and far below the October low. Instead, it close above its midpoint and above the October low. It is a weak entry bar for the bears.<h3>Weak top usually needs to go sideways before down</h3><p>This buy climax top is coming after an extremely strong rally in 2019. Strong bull trends do not typically instantly reverse into bear trends. They usually have to transition into a trading range 1st.<p>That is what is likely over the next several months and possibly all of 2020. Traders should expect the bond market to be mostly sideways for many bars.<h3>Nested wedge top</h3><p>I have been writing for several years about the nested wedge top on the monthly chart. Unless bonds break far above that top, that top should be the approximate end of the 30 year bull trend. This year went above the wedge top, but only briefly in August. The 2019 rally was a parabolic wedge buy climax. This reversal down is another attempt to end the 30 year bull trend<p>I have been saying that the transition into a 20 year bear trend might take many years. That process is still underway.<p>I also have said that the US will not allow negative interest rates. That will therefore put a cap on bond prices. Traders should not expect significantly higher bond prices from here.<p>While ultimately bonds will go much lower, they might continue sideways for a few years first. There is no sign of an imminent selloff. Traders will probably see a big trading range in 2020.<h2><strong>EURUSD weekly Forex chart:</strong><br>2nd leg up likely, but might test October low 1st</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EURUSD-Forex-trading-range-in-bear-channel-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-30-1.png\" alt=\"EURUSD Forex trading range in bear channel\"></a></figure><p>The EURUSD weekly Forex chart reversed up from a nested wedge bottom in October. The 3 bar rally in October was the strongest rally on the weekly chart in almost 2 years. A strong rally usually has a 2nd leg up, and so does a wedge bottom. Consequently, traders should expect a 2nd leg sideways to up. The minimum goal is a test of the October high and the 13 month bear trend line. Both are around 1.12.<p>But from what level will the 2nd leg up begin? No one knows. The bulls are hoping that next week will reverse up from the micro double bottom over the past 3 weeks. Last week was a doji bar and that is not a strong buy signal bar for next week. They will need a strong bull bar next week for a reliable entry bar. Otherwise, the EURUSD might drift down to the October low over the next few weeks.<h3>Lower lows mean the bear channel is intact</h3><p>The bears want a strong break below the October low. That would be a sign that the 2 year bear channel is still intact. A bear channel is a bear trend. The bears have enjoyed their bear trend for 22 months.<p>They know that every new low for 2 years quickly reversed up for several weeks. They expect that to happen again. That will not upset them as long as the chart continues to form lower highs and lows. They will then continue to sell 2 – 3 week rallies, expect a 200 pip profit on the fall to a new low.<p>There are magnets not too far below at around 1.08. Therefore the bear trend might not end until they are tested. The double tops in September 2018 and again in June 2019 both have measured move projections down to just above 1.08. Also, the gap above the April 21, 2017 high is a magnet and it is around that same 1.08 level.<p>If there is a strong break above the June lower high just above 1.14, traders will reevaluate what is going on. That rally would increase the chance that the bear trend had ended. The EURUSD would then either be in a trading range or a bull trend.<h3>How important is a new low?</h3><p>Does it matter if there is a new low? Not really. Both the bulls and bears have been buying around the prior low for 2 years. The bulls buy for a 100 – 200 pip bounce and the bears take profits from their most recent sell from 200 – 300 pips higher.<p>Traders expect a 2nd leg sideways to up after the October rally. If it comes from a higher low, the reversal up will be a higher low major trend reversal. It will probably only lead to a 2 – 3 week, 200 pip bounce, like every other reversal up from a new low.<p>If the rally comes from below the October low, traders would not see it as a 2nd leg up. However, they would think of it as just another rally from a new low in the 2 year bear channel. They will trade the rally the same whether it comes from a lower or higher low.<h3>Reversal at the 1st of the year?</h3><p>Currencies sometimes have trend reversals around the 1st of the year. Since this selloff has lasted an unusually long time, traders expect a reversal up soon.<p>The EURUSD is entering a time window when reversals tend to occur. Traders should therefore watch the EURUSD more carefully into January to see if there is a good buy signal bar on the daily, weekly, or monthly charts. A reversal up would have a greater chance of success if there was a strong buy signal bar on the weekly or monthly chart.<h2><strong>Monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Strong bull trend near top of bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-monthly-candlestick-chart-testing-top-of-12-year-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-30-2.png\" alt=\"Bears want the breakout to fail\nNeed reversal down in December\n\"></a></figure><p>The monthly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart&nbsp;rallied strongly in November after gapping above the October high. Gaps are rare on the monthly chart. Small gaps and gaps late in bull trends typically close within 5 – 10 bars. Therefore, traders should expect a pullback to below the October high at some point within the next year.<p>However, the bull trend is strong. Furthermore, the top of the 12 year bull channel will be just above 3173 in December. That is a magnet above. The Emini is close enough so that it probably cannot escape the magnetic pull. Traders should expect the Emini to get there within a couple months and maybe this year.<h3>Importance of monthly trend lines</h3><p>It is important to understand that every bear trend since the Depression reversed up from a dip below a monthly bull trend line. A bull trend is is the bottom of a bull channel. The Emini is near the top of the bull channel. What will traders expect if the Emini goes above the top of the channel? They should expect a reversal down.<p>How far down? The goal is a test of the bottom of the bull channel. The bull trend line is now just below 2600.<p>Reversals at the top and bottom of channels usually come after overshoots. Therefore, a reversal down will probably only come after the Emini goes at least 20 – 50 points above the top of the monthly channel. It usually begins within 5 bars (here, months) of breaking above the channel.<h3>Minimum goal for reversal down from top of bull channel</h3><p>Does the reversal have to reach the bottom of the channel? No. Very often, a reversal goes sideways to down for 2 or more legs to the middle of the channel. The bull trend at that point frequently resumes back up. That means that the middle of the channel is the minimum goal if there is a reversal down.<h3>What about an island top?</h3><p>If there is a gap down at any point, it would create an island top with the November gap up. I don’t ever remember seeing an island top on the monthly chart in my 33 years of trading.<p>Also, island tops and bottoms are typically minor reversal patterns. While the bears might get a few bars (months) down, they should not look at an island top and expect a bear trend. They eventually will get one, but the island top would not be the major force behind it.<h2><strong>Weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Breakout above top of bull channel, but buy climax</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-weekly-candlestick-chart-breaking-above-bull-channel-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-30-3.png\" alt=\"Emini weekly candlestick chart breaking above bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The weekly S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has not had a pullback in 9 weeks. A 9 week bull micro channel is a sign of strong bulls. They have been aggressively buying above the low of the prior week for 2 months. Traders should expect the bulls to buy at and below this week’s low if they get a chance.<p>However, a micro channel is unsustainable and therefore a buy climax. As the Emini gets further above the protective stop of the bulls (now, the October 3 low), the bulls at some point will need to reduce their risk. The easiest way is to take some profits. That profit taking will cause a pullback. But because other bulls are eager to buy the 1st pullback, it will probably only last a week or two.<p>Last week was the 1st bear bar in 7 weeks. It increases the chance of another bear bar within a few weeks. This week’s candlestick has a noticeable tail on top, which means traders sold into the end of the week. This is another sign of exhausted bulls. But because the bull trend is so strong, traders are not looking for more than a 1 – 2 week pullback at the moment.<h3>Eventual evolution into a trading range</h3><p>Once the Emini begins to form pullbacks, the bears will begin to sell the next new high. Also, the bulls will become quicker to take profits. Some will switch from buying above the high of the prior bar to buying pullbacks. Additionally, they might start to take profits at a new high.<p>If enough traders make this change, the strong bull trend will stop going up and begin to go sideways. If so, the bears will become more willing to short and the bulls will be more willing to greatly reduce their position size. This could result in a swing down for several weeks. But most traders will want either a double top or a micro double top before there will be more than a couple weeks down.<h2><strong>Daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart:</strong><br>Buy climax, but room to top of bull channel</h2><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Emini-daily-candlestick-chart-reversing-down-from-top-of-bull-channel.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"2019-11-30-4.png\" alt=\"Emini daily candlestick chart reversing down from top of bull channel\"></a></figure><p>The daily S&amp;P500 Emini futures chart has been in a Small Pullback Bull Trend for 2 months. How far up can this strong bull trend go over the next month? The top of the channel on the monthly chart is a possible target.<p>But since the buy climax is extreme, Friday might be the start of a minor reversal down. The 1st target is the bull trend line. If the bears break below that, then the next target is the start of the bull channel. That is either the October 18 or 31 low.<p>A tight bull channel does not typically instantly reverse into a bear trend. Traders know that most bear trends begin with some kind of double top. Consequently, the bulls will buy the reversal down, even if it is more than 100 points. The best the bears can probably get over the next month is a trading range and not a bear trend.<h3>3 different bull channels</h3><p>There are different bull channels on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts. Each has a different starting point and the tops are each at a different price. The one on the daily chart began with the October 18 low. The weekly bull channel began in November 2018, and the Emini broke above it 2 weeks ago. Finally, the monthly bull channel began in 2007. Its top is around 3173.<p>The Emini will probably have to go above all 3 before there is more than a 5% correction. Traders should therefore expect higher prices over the next couple months. This is true even if there is a 100 point correction first.<h3>Don’t forget last December</h3><p>Markets like symmetry. They tend to repeat behavior, like in Leg 1 = Leg 2 measured moves. They sometimes create the exact opposite of what just happened. It is common to see a big bear bar after a big bull bar and vice versa.<p>Do you remember what happened last December? There was a huge sell climax and then a tremendous reversal up. This year is ending with a huge rally, which is the opposite of last year. That does not mean that the Emini will have a huge selloff and create the mirror image of last year. But it does slightly increase the odds. Consequently, if a strong reversal down begins, the bulls should make sure that there is a credible buy signal before buying.<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><h2>Trading Room</h2><p>Traders can see the end of the day<a href=\"http://www.brookspriceaction.com/profile.php?mode=profil&amp;sub=profile_prefer&amp;mod=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bar-by-bar price action report by signing up</a>for free at BrooksPriceAction.com.
