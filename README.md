[Trello -- Brooks Viewer To Do](https://trello.com/b/9FnXMYrH/brooks-viewer)

## To Do
- change all path.join(...) calls so data is retrieved from ipcRenderer in background.ts

## Info
- data must currently be supplied manually:
  - `./renderer/public/price-action-images`
  - `./renderer/public/trading-course-images`



## Doing Now
- changed location of trading-course images in public to be more consistent with price-action images
