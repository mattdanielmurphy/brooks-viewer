This led to a bull channel to just below the measured move target based on the height of the Triangle.</li><li>The Emini had a midday reversal down from a parabolic wedge buy climax.</li><li>99.95% of days have at least 3 bars with lows below the EMA, which happened today.</li><li>75% of the time, there is then a test of the dayâ€™s high after the 20-Gap Bar buy setup. That did not happen today. </li><li>Also, 60% chance Moving Average Gap Bars in a bull trend will lead to a test of the high. That also failed.</li><li>Instead, the selloff to the EMA was also a test of the apex of the earlier triangle. The reversal down was a Midday Bear Trend Reversal, and not just a minor reversal down to the EMA.</li><li>On the daily chart, 4-day rally, but lacked consecutive big bull bars closing on their highs. It therefore looks more like a leg in a trading range than a resumption of the bull trend.</li><li>If there are several bear bars over the next several days, the odds that the 15% correction has begun will remain at 50%.</li><li>If the bulls begin to get bull bars closing near their highs, the 18-month bull trend would then likely be resuming. The odds of a new high before a 15% correction would go up to 60%.</li></ul><p><em>See the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.brookstradingcourse.com/blog/analysis/" target="_blank">weekly update</a> for a discussion of the price action on the weekly chart and for what to expect going into next week.</em></p>
